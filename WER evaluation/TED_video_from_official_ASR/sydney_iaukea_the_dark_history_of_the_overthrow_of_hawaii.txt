 It was January 16th, 1895. Two men arrived at Lili Lil Kalani's door, arrested her and led her to the room where she would be imprisoned. A group had recently seized power and now confiscated her diaries, ransacked her house, claimed her lands, and hid her away. Lili Wokalani was Hawaii's queen and she ruled through one of the most turbulent periods of its history. 75 years earlier, American missionaries first arrived in Hawaii. They quickly amassed power building businesses and claiming arable land that they transformed into plantations. They worked closely with the Ali-E, or sacred Hawaiian nobility, closely linked to the gods. The Ali-E appointed missionaries to government roles where they helped establish Hawaii as a sovereign kingdom with a constitutional monarchy. But once certain business opportunities emerged, namely the prospect of exporting sugar to the US tariff free, some of their descendants shifted positions. They formed a political group known as the missionary party and began plotting to annex Hawaii, bringing it under US control. Lili Wokalani and her siblings were born into an Ali-E family. In 1874, her brother, Kalakawa, ascended the throne, but 13 years into his reign, the emerging threat crystallized. The missionary party called a meeting where an all-white militia surrounded and forced the king to sign new legislation. Later called the Bayonet Constitution, its stripped native Hawaiians of their rights, diminished the monarchies' power and ceded control to this group of white businessmen. Four years later, King Kalakawa died, heartbroken Lili Wokalani said, by the basing gratitude of the very persons whose fortunes he had made. Prepared to fight, she assumed the throne. Despite death threats and rumors of insurgency, Queen Lili Wokalani was determined to restore power to her people, an estimated two-thirds of whom had lost their voting rights. Fluttered with requests for change, she authored a new constitution. But before she introduced it, the so-called Committee of Safety, a new organization that consisted of many missionary party members, hatched another plot. Under the false pretense that this new constitution endangered American property and lives, they staged a coup on January 17, 1893. More than 160 U.S. Marines marched to the palace where the Committee of Safety removed Queen Lili Wokalani from office. Thousands of Hawaiian people protested, somewhere in Hatban's reading Aloha Aina or Love of the Nation. The alleged provisional government declared Hawaii a republic the following year. They proclaimed that Hawaiians couldn't vote or be government employees without signing a new oath of allegiance. Many refused. The following year, some of Lili Wokalani supporters attempted a counter revolution. The republic responded brutally. Jailing hundreds and sentencing six people to death. In exchange for their release, the republic made Lili Wokalani sign a document that claimed to relinquish her throne. And they imprisoned her in the palace. Under constant guard, she composed songs expressing her love for her people and began making a patchwork quilt that told the story of her life. While she was only allowed news that had been reviewed by her jailers, her supporters often brought her bouquets from the garden she dedicated to them, wrapped in newspaper. After eight months, Lili Wokalani was placed under house arrest. As soon as it was lifted, she traveled to Washington, D.C. with Hawaiian nationalists and over 20,000 signatures. There, they successfully convinced Congress to halt the republic's annexation treaty. But the following year, the Spanish-American war began. Seeing Hawai'i as a strategic military base, President William McKinley declared it a US territory on July 7, 1898. Breaking international law and devastating Queen Lili Wokalani and her people. She spent the rest of her life petitioning for the restoration of her lands, native Hawaiian rights and national liberation. When she died in 1917, these dreams were unrealized. A member of the group that forced Queen Lili Wokalani out of office once declared, if we are ever to have peace and annexation, the first thing to do is obliterate the past. They failed at this goal. Queen Lili Wokalani left a resilient legacy. Her commitment to her land and people never wavered, and many Hawaiians continue to fight in her memory. Speaking of Hawai'i's children, Queen Lili Wokalani said, It is for them that I would give the last drop of my blood.
