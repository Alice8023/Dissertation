 The decorative use of wire in southern Africa dates back hundreds of years, but modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material in the form of telephone wire. Rural to open migration meant that new found industrial materials started to replace hard to come by natural grasses. So here you can see the change from using, starting to use contemporary materials. These pieces date back from the 40s to the late 50s. In the 90s my interest in passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form which came from a squatter camp outside Durban. And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point and started developing really and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design. And the project soon grew from five to 50 reavers in about a year. And soon we had offgrown the scrap yards what they could provide. So we coherced a wire manufacturer to help us and we're not only to supply the materials in on bobbins but to produce our color specifications. At the same time I was thinking well there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products away from the ethnic a little bit more contemporary. So I developed a whole range around a mass produced strange that obviously fitted into a much higher in decor market that could be exported and also service our local market. We started experimenting as you can see in terms of shapes, forms, the scale would become very important. And it's become our pet project that success was running for 12 years and we supply the cornering shops and Donna Karen and so it's kind of great. This is our group, our main group of weavers. They come on a weekly basis to Durban. They all have bank accounts. They all move back to the rural area where they came from. It's a weekly turnaround of production. This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of and that's also modern us today and it's supporting work for 300 weavers and the rest there's it all. Thank you very much.
