 I was recently traveling in the highlands of New Guinea and I was talking with a man who had three wives and I asked him how many wives would you like to have and was this long pause and I thought to myself is he going to say five is he going to say ten is he going to say twenty five and he leaned towards me and he whispered none 86% 86% of human societies permit a man to have several wives polygene but in the vast majority of these cultures only about five or ten percent of men actually do have several wives having several partners can be a toothache in fact co-wives can fight with each other sometimes they can even poison each other's children and you got to have a lot of cows a lot of goats a lot of money a lot of land in order to build a herm we are a pair bonding species 97% of mammals do not pair up to read their young human beings do I'm not suggesting that we're not that was necessarily sexually faithful to our partners I've looked at adultery in 42 cultures I understand some of actually the genetics of it and some of the brain circuitry of it it's very common around the world but we are built to love how is technology changing love I'm going to say almost not at all I studied the brain I and my colleagues have put over a hundred people into a brain skiner people who were just fallen happily in love people who had just been rejected in love and people who are in love long term and it is possible to remain in love long term and I've long ago maintained that we've evolved three distinctly different brain systems from mating and reproduction sex drive feelings of intense romantic love and feelings of deep cosmic attachment to a long term partner and together these three brain systems with many other parts of the brain orchestrate are sexual are romantic and our family lives but they lie way below the cortex way below the limbic system where we do our where we feel our emotions generate our emotions they lie in the most primitive parts of the brain linked with energy focus craving motivation wanting and drive in this case the drive to win life's greatest prize a mating partner they evolved over 4.4 million years ago among our first ancestors and they're not going to change if you sweep left or right on Tinder there's no question that technology is changing the way we court emailing texting emojis to express your emotions sexting liking a photograph selfies we're seeing new rules and and taboos for how to court but you know is this actually dramatically changing love what about the late 1940s when the automobile became very popular and we suddenly had rolling bedrooms how about the introduction of the birth control pill unchained from the great threat of pregnancy and social ruin women could finally express their primitive and primal sexuality even dating sites are not changing love i'm chief scientific advisor to match calm i've been it for 11 years i keep telling them and they agree with me that these are not dating sites they are introducing sites when you sit down in a bar in a coffee house on a park bench your ancient brain snaps in action like a sleeping cat awakened and you smile and laugh and listen and parade the way our ancestors did a hundred thousand years ago the only can give you various people all the dating sites can but the only real algorithm is your own human brain technology is not going to change that technology is also going to not change who you choose to love i study the biology of personality and i've come to believe that we've evolved for a very broad styles of thinking and behaving linked with the dopamine serotonin testosterone and estrogen systems so i created a questionnaire directly from brain science to measure the degree to which you express the traits the constellation of traits linked with each of these four brain systems i then put that questionnaire on various match dating sites in 40 countries 14 million or more people have now taken the questionnaire and i've been able to watch who's naturally drawn to home and as it turns out those who are very expressive of the dopamine system they tend to be curious creative spontaneous energetic i would imagine there's an awful lot of people like that in this room they're drawn to people like themselves curious creative people need people like themselves people are very expressive of the serotonin system tend to be traditional conventional they follow the rules they respect authority they tend to be religious religiosity is in the serotonin system and traditional people go for traditional people in that way similarity attracts in the other two cases opposites attract people very expressive of the testosterone system tend to be analytical logical direct decisive and they go for their opposite they go for somebody who's high estrogen somebody who's got very good verbal skills and people skills who's very intuitive and who's very nurturing and emotionally expressive we have natural patterns of make choice modern technology is not going to change who we choose to love but technology is producing one modern trend that i find particularly important it's associated with the concept of paradox of choice millions of years we lived in little hunting together in groups it didn't have the opportunity to choose between a thousand people on a dating site in fact i've been studying this recently and i actually think there's some sort of sweet spot in the brain and i don't know what it is but apparently from reading a lot of the data we can embrace about five to nine alternatives and after that you get into what academics called cognitive overload and you don't choose any so i've come to think that due to this cognitive overload we're ushing in a new form of courtship that i call slow love i arrived at this during my work with match.com every year for the last six years we've done a study called singles in america we don't pull the match population we pull the american population we use a five thousand plus people representative sample of americans based on the u.s. census we got data now on over 30,000 people and every single year i see some of the same patterns every single year when i asked the question over 50% of people have had a one-night stand not necessarily last year but in their lives 50% have had a friend with benefits during the course of their lives and over 50% have lived with a person long term before marrying americans think that this is reckless i have doubted that for a long time the patterns are too strong there's got to be some Darwinian explanation not that many people are crazy and so i stumbled then on a statistic that really came home to me i it was a it was a very interesting academic article in which i found that 67% of singles in america today who are living long term with somebody have not yet married because they are terrified of divorce they're terrified of the social legal emotional economic consequences of divorce so it came to realize that i don't think that this is rectusness i think that it's caution today singles want to know every single thing about a partner before they wed you learn a lot between the sheets not only is about how somebody makes love but whether they're kind whether they can listen and at my age whether they got a sense of humor and in an age where we have too many choices and we have very little fear of pregnancy and disease and we got no feeling of shame first sex before marriage i think people are taking their time to love and actually what's happening is what we're seeing is a real expansion of the pre-convictment stage before you tie the knot where marriage used to be the beginning of a relationship now it's the finale but the human brain the human brain always triumphs and indeed in the united states today 86% of americans will marry by age 49 and even in cultures around the world where they're not married is often they are settling down eventually with a long term partner so it began to occur to if there's during this long extension pre-committment stage if you can get rid of bad relationship before you marry maybe we're going to see more happy marriages so i did a study of 1,100 married people in america not on match dot com of course and i asked them a lot of questions but one of the questions was would you remarry the person you're currently married to and 81% said yes in fact the greatest change in modern romance and family life is not technology it's not even slow love it's actually women piling into the job market in cultures around the world for millions of years our ancestors lived in little hunting and gathering groups women commuted to work to gather their fruits and vegetables they came home with 60 to 80% of the evening meal the double income family was the rule and women were regarded as just as economically socially and sexually powerful as men then the environment changed some 10,000 years ago we began to settle down on the farm and both men and women they became obliged really to marry the right person from the right background from the right religion and from the right kin and social and political connections men's jobs became more important they had to move the rocks fell the trees plow the land they brought the produce of to local markets and came home with the equivalent of money and along with this we see a rise of a host of beliefs the belief of virginity at marriage arranged marriages strictly arranged marriages the belief that the man is the head of the household that the wife's place is in the home and most important honor they husband and child death do us part these are gone they are going and in many places they are gone we are right now in a marriage revolution we are shedding 10,000 years of our farming tradition and moving forward towards egalitarian relationships between the sexes something that I regard as highly compatible with the ancient human spirit i'm not a pollyanna there's a great deal to cry about i studied divorce in the 80 cultures i studied as i say adultery and many there's a whole pile of problems as William Butler yates the poet once said love is the crooked thing i would add nobody gets out alive we all have problems that in fact i think the poet Randall Gerald really sums it up best he said the dark uneasy world of family life where the greatest can fail and the humblest succeed but i will leave you with this love and attachment will prevail technology cannot change it and i will conclude by saying that any understanding of human relationships must take into account one of the most powerful determinants of human behavior the unquenchable adaptable and primordial human drive to love thank you thank you so much for that Helen you know as you know there's another speaker here with us that works in your same field she comes at it from a different perspective ester perl is a psychotherapist who works with couples you study data ester studies the stories the couples tell her when they come to her for help let's have her join us on the stage ester so ester when you were watching Helen's talk was there any part of it that sort of resonated with you through the lens of your own work that you'd like to comment on so it's interesting because on the one hand the need for love is ubiquitous and universal but the way we love the meaning we make out of it the rules that govern our relationships i think are changing fundamentally i mean we come from a model that until now was primarily regulated around duty and obligation and the needs for the collective and loyalty and we have shifted it to a model of free choice and individual and individual rights and and self-fulfillment and happiness and so that was the first thing i thought is that the need doesn't change but the context and the way we regulate these relationships changes a lot on the paradox of choice so you know on the one hand we relish the novelty and the playfulness i think to to to be able to have so much options and at the same time as you talk about this cognitive overload i see many many people who who dread the uncertainty and self-doubt that comes with this mass of choice creating a case of FOMO and then leading us FOMO fear of missed opportunity or fear of missing out but it's like how do i know i have found the one the right one so we've created what i call this thing of stable ambiguity stable ambiguity is when you are too afraid to be alone but also not really willing to engage in intimacy building it's a set of tactics that kind of prolong the uncertainty of a relationship but also the uncertainty of the breakup so here on the internet you have three major ones one is icing and simmering which are great stalling tactics that offer a kind of holding pattern that emphasize the undefined nature of a relationship but at the same time give you enough of a comforting consistency and enough freedom of the undefined boundaries yeah and then comes ghosting and ghosting is basically you know you disappear from this mass of text on the spot and you don't have to deal with the pain that you inflict of another because you're making it invisible even to yourself yeah so i was thinking i mean these words like came up to me as you were as i was listening to you like how a vocabulary creates also a reality and at the same time that's my question to you is like do you think when the context changes it still means that the nature of love remains the same you studied a brain and i studied people's relationships and stories so i think it's everything you say plus but i don't always know the degree to which a changing context does it at some point begin to change if the meaning changes that it changes the need or is the need clear of the entire context wow well well first of all to your first one there's no question about that we've changed that we now want a personal love and that for thousands of years we had to marry the right person from the right background and the right kin connection and in fact in my studies of five thousand people every year i asked them what are you looking for and every single year over ninety seven percent say this grows yeah well no i mean the basic things are over ninety seven percent of of people want somebody that respects them somebody that they can trust and confide in somebody who makes them laugh somebody who makes enough time for them and somebody who they find physically attractive physically attractive that never changes and there's certainly you know this to prove how i cruel that it's like this is not what people used to see what they would have said right is that they wanted somebody with whom they can't companionship economic support children you know we went from a production economy to a service economy we did it in the larger culture and we do anything there is no question about it but it's interesting the millennials actually want to be very good parents whereas the generation above them wants to have a very fine marriage but it's not as focused on being a good parent i mean you see all of these no nuances you know there's two parts basic parts of personality there's your culture everything you grew up to do and believe and say and there's your temperament and basically what i've been talking about is your temperament and that temperament is certainly going to change with changing times and changing beliefs and you know and and you know that in terms of the paradox of choice there's no question about it that this is a pickle i mean there were millions of years where you found that sweet boy at the other side of the water hall and you went for it yeah you know i want to say one thing i don't want to say one more thing bottom line is in hunting and gallery societies they tended to have two or three partners during the course of their lives i mean they weren't square i mean i'm suggesting that we do but the bottom line is um you know we've always had alternatives a man kind is always in fact the brain is well built to what we call it equilibrate to try and decide do i come do i stay do i go do i stay you know what are the opportunities here how do i handle this there and so i think we're seeing another play out of that now well thank you both so much i think you're gonna have a million different partners first night thank you thank you
