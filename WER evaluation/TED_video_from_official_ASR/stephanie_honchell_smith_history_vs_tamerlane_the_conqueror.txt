 He was born in the 1330s in the Chagatayid Hanit, formerly the Mongol Empire in Central Asia. On the unforgiving step he rose from a lowly sheep thief to become one of history's greatest conquerors, uniting nearly all of Central Asia, Afghanistan and Iran under his rule. It was he a great state builder for a bloodthirsty tyrant. Order order order, who do we have on a stand today? Tamer... lane? That wasn't his name, Your Honor. The great Timur, meaning iron, was nicknamed Timur the Lane by enemies who mocked permanent injuries to his leg and arm. Injuries he sustained raiding a rival tribe's sheep herd. He was a thief and a scoundrel from the start. Maybe we actually don't know for sure, but even if that's true, raiding rivals was just part of nomadic life at the time. Tamur was not born into a ruling family, so he had to prove his worth through daring and horsemanship. He was hardly a commoner. Tamur's family was minor nobility. His uncle and brother-in-law were high-ranking officials, and when they trusted Tamur on a diplomatic mission, he defected to a rival con. Strategic maneuvering. He reconciled with his uncle and brother-in-law soon after. Only for long enough to consolidate his own power. Then he went to battle against his brother-in-law, supposedly his closest ally. He was assassinated, and Tamur seized power. They may have been friends, but he was a corrupt man who alienated a lot of people. Tamur was right to oust him. Afterward he managed to reunite most of the Khanate's territories and put an end to decades of bloody infighting. OK, so where are we? I can hardly keep up. 1370, Yana. And he's hot now? Well, not quite. Tamur was not a direct descendant of Chingus Khan, so he couldn't claim the title. Instead, he appointed Figuehade Khan's and referred to himself as Amir, or Commander, and later as Gurghan, or Sunn-in-Law, after he married a woman who was descended from Chingus Khan. He claimed to be a divinely ordained protector of the Mongol and Muslim worlds. Yet he undermined both Mongol and Muslim power by relentlessly waging war against his neighbors, weakening them so much that Christian Europe romanticized him as an ally. His campaigns killed as many as 17 million people. Propaganda Tamur's official biographies deliberately exaggerated the number of deaths to deter rebellions. At the Mongols, Tamur offered cities the chance to surrender and only ordered massacres if they revolted. He rebuilt irrigation canals to support agriculture and regularly distributed food to the poor. Just in his hometown of Keshe, he paid for the meat of 20 sheep to be given to the poor every day. His campaigns wore brutal, but by unifying central Asia, Afghanistan, and Iran, he was also able to reinvigorate the Silk Road. Much of Eurasia benefited from the revival of long-distance trade and central Asian cities such as Samar Khan and Herak became thrive in commercial hubs under his rule. And meanwhile, other cities like Baghdad, Aleppo, and Delhi were plundered and burned and took decades to recover. This illiterate warlord destroyed centuries' worth of cultural heritage, leaving nothing but pyramids of skulls in his wake. Tamur may have been illiterate, but he was also an active patron of culture and the arts. During his conquests, he spared artisans and scholars, sending them to work on public projects like schools and mosques. Unlike many women in the world at the time, his wives, daughters, and daughters-in-law were highly educated and politically active. Tamur also personally met with and impressed the famed Arab historian, even Khaldun, in Damascus, and he so thoroughly mastered chess that he is said to have enjoyed a more complex variant that was named for him. So what happened ever that? Tamur died from an illness in 1405 when he was likely in his early 70s. The empire he founded lasted another hundred years, ushering in an architectural, artistic, literary, and scientific renaissance across Central Asia. In Samar Khan, Tamur's grandson Ulub Beg built the largest astronomical observatory in the world at the time. Even after the fall of Tamur's empire, his descendant Babur re-established himself in India, founding the Mughal empire, which would become home to nearly a quarter of the world's population, and which built such splendors as the Red Fort and Taj Mahal. Tamur's legacy is still celebrated in monuments across Central Asia, where he is remembered as Buyuk Baba Mis, or our great forefather. And yet today, in Europe, India, and much of the Middle East, he's remembered as a butcher. That's more a reflection of the success of his own propaganda than of the man himself. Hold on now, I think I've almost got the king cornered. Emerging from relative obscurity, Tamur's conquests formed a legacy lasting nearly 500 years that remains on trial even today.
