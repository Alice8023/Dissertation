 Oh my god. I'm so excited. This is my last thing people said, last 20, 20, hi. Hi people. I've had a lot of accomplishments, but this is a dream come true right now. I love you. So make a noise for the dress. And now the back of the dress. Can we get booty cam please? Booty cam. If you follow me on social media, you probably see my heiny before. It's no secret. But you know, I used to hate my ass. Believe it or not. I have my father's shape and my mother's size. So it was big and long. I used to think that only ass is like J-Lo's or Beyonce's could be famous. I never thought that could happen to me. I always felt like my body type wasn't the right one or the desirable one growing up. Because I grew up in an era where having a big ass wasn't mainstream. I grew up watching movies where women were like, this my ass looks fat in this? Like it was a bad thing. I felt like the ass odds were against me. But baby. This pedonco donk donk was going places. My ass has been the topic of conversation. My ass has been in magazines. Rihanna gave my ass a standing ovation. Yes, my booty. My least favorite part of my body. How did this happen? Swarking. Through the movement of swarking, I discovered my ass is my greatest asset. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Ted Swarck. I'm going to take my shoes off. The first time I saw Swarck in person was at a teen club called the Z in Houston, Texas. Hey, shout out Houston. We got some Houstonies here. There I saw a bunch of girls my age shaking their booty to New Orleans, Bounce, and I was like, how are they doing that? It was incredible to me. Thanks to my Caribbean besties, Peaches and Jelene, and thanks to MasterPee. I found the rhythm. The better I got, the more I fell in love with what I had because damn, my ass could do magic. Finally, I could twerk, but twerking did not begin with me. Believe it or not. I know you think I invented twerker and I did. I want you to know where twerking came from. I think everyone should know where everything comes from. You should know where your food and water come from. You should know where your clothes come from. It's important to me to keep the origin story of twerking alive. So here's some farm to table for that ass. So cool. Modern dates working derived from black people and black culture. It has a direct parallel to West African dances like Mapuca. Traditionally, Mapuca was a dance for West African women to be used as a celebration of joy, religious worship. Or a dance to do it or wedding to show you or DTF or DTM. Down to Mary. Get your mind off the gutter. Black women carried these dances across the transatlantic slave trade to the ring shout and what became the black American church. And so the hips of Maureenian, Bessie Smith when they sang the blues. Into the bounce of Josephine Baker's banana dance. From jazz dance to jitterbug, from shake your tail feather to shake your thing to that thing thingin. But black people carried the origins of this dance through our DNA, through our blood, through our bones. We made twerking the global cultural phenomenon it has become today. Now, as a big black woman who has asked who can twerk and who's been doing it her whole life, I kind of think I'm an expert on the subject. I want to add to the classical etymology of this dance because it matters. Black people will not be erased from the creation, the history and the innovation of twerking. Thank you. From TikTok trends to songs and humor, we see so much erasure of what black people have created. So I want to do everything in my power to prevent the erasure of blackness from twerking. Twerking is a black American communal collaboration born of black southern culture. From DJ Jubilee and Cashmoney Records to New Orleans to Lil John and the Yin Yang twins in Atlanta to Uncle Luke in Miami, twerking was alive and well in nearly every black club in a self. But it would take years after these songs were released for twerking to finally become mainstream. I got a test for y'all. No, no, no, no, you know that one. How do y'all see it? Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, no, no. The uh oh dance. Beyonce called it that because she was trying to warn us. Because of Destiny's Child, booty-licious is in the dictionary. And because of Beyonce's 2003 music video for her single Crazy in Love, the world was introduced to the O-Dance. That was the first time I'd ever seen a pop star do something like that and I wanted to be just like her. Beyonce gave me permission to be myself. To be booty-ish-ish. Because she could shake ass and still be seen as classy in the eyes of America. And that was hard to do. When I moved from Houston to Minneapolis in the early 2010s, I hadn't seen it working in a while until Big Freedah's tour came to town. Now Big Freedah performs bounce music with the voice of a preacher in the body of a bad bitch. If you can imagine this incredible. Big Freedah has a moment in her shows where she will call people on stage at work and she chose me from the audience to battle another person. And I remember being like, oh my God, I missed this so much. When I was up there, I thought to myself, not only am I shaking ass, but I'm winning. And besides Big Freedah, I'm the best twerker in the building. And just like that, I was reintroduced to twerking. When I started to perform my solo music, I began incorporating twerking into my performances. And people would go crazy. I performed for mainly indie audiences so they didn't know what the fuck was happening. And I liked it that way. Twerking made me feel empowered. It was my secret language, my sauce. Little did I know that a couple years later, Miley Cyrus would perform, which seemed like the twerk her around the world. Y'all remember that. In 2013, within a month of each other, I released my debut project, Lizzo Bangers. And Miley Cyrus released her project, Bangers. That same year, Miley released a single, we came stop and she was twerking in the video. I remember being like, this is crazy. He had a Montana twerking all over the place. A couple months later, she performed with Robin Thickland of VMAs. And that night, seemingly overnight, twerking went mainstream. The media described twerking as, I quote, disturbing and disgusting. Critics blasted twerking as something that was exploiting and over-sexualizing young women. Once mainstream, twerking was misunderstood and taken out of context. It was bittersweet. For one, I wish that a black woman could have popularized twerking in the mainstream. But on the other end, twerking going mainstream played a role in the rise of my profile and my career. Listen, everything that black people create from fashion to music to the way we talk is co-opted, appropriated, and taken by pop culture. APPLAUSE For this reason, optimism can be an illusion to the experience of black people in America. In this TED talk, I'm not trying to gatekeep, but I'm definitely trying to let you know who built the damn gate. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE The fact that I can make a stake in the reclamation of black things and black culture makes me very optimistic. To be on stage at the premier conference for the experts in their field, talking about twerking, and stating my facts makes me optimistic. The best thing I can do is be loud and take ownership. Because for me, twerking is a pearl of optimism. It's a form of self-expression, freedom, confidence. Twerking is not just something I do to music. It's extremely useful. It manifests in my life in ways that I need more joy. In the mornings, twerking leaves me to stretch and then taking care of my body. I bend over and isolate my cheeks. I'm in downward dog. Namaste. LAUGHTER Sometimes I put on a song and I shake ass and immediately I'm in love with myself and not just self-love. I mean, like, OK, Lizzo, wish you a number. LAUGHTER I would do me, but it's not just sexual. LAUGHTER It's not! LAUGHTER APPLAUSE Twerking is a deep, soulful, spiritual practice. It's hip opening. It's empowering. When performed as the Mabuka, it's set to connect you to God. It's sacred. And now we're practicing that on mainstream stages. We're practicing that at home. And it's contributing to the liberation of women and people around the world. Twerking is good for humanity. LAUGHTER 40 years ago, when black and brown people in New York invented break dancing, it was villainized. Mainstream media weaponized break dancing by connecting it to gang activity and violence. As an art form and subculture, it wasn't taken seriously. Fast forward to today, break dancing is now an Olympic sport. What will be the future of twerking? Russian ballet dancers are twerking. Have you seen it? They'd be like this. LAUGHTER You all think I'm playing? K out there life. Do do do do. LAUGHTER Can we clear Charkovsky? LAUGHTER Will we seats working as an Olympic sport one day? And will black people still be part of it? I'm proud to be at Swerk Pioneer. I'm grateful for the asses that came before me. LAUGHTER All hell beyond say. Nicki Minaj. From Betty Boop to Buffy the Body. When I shake this ass, I do it for the culture. Not the culture. For me, twerking ain't a trend. My body is not a trend. I twerk for the strippers, for the video vixens, for the church ladies who shout for the sex workers. I twerk because black women are undeniable. I twerk for my ancestors, for sexual liberation, for my bitches, hey girl. LAUGHTER Because I can. Because I know I look good. I twerk because it's unique to the black experience. It's unique to my culture, and it means something real to me. I twerk because I'm talented. LAUGHTER LAUGHTER Because I'm sexual, but not to be sexualized. LAUGHTER I twerk to own my power, to reclaim my blackness, my culture. I twerk for fat black women because being fat and black is a beautiful thing. LAUGHTER I twerk because it's natural to me as breathing. Black women invented twerking, and twerking is part of the revolution. We've been doing it. We're going to keep on doing it, because we have, and always, will be the blueprint. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE We twerk to remind ourselves we hear, and we ain't going nowhere. So, in the case of optimism, I want everyone to stand up and shake some ass with me. Are you all ready? Come on, y'all. I've been waiting for this one. I'm going to show you how to do it. Pop, pop, pop, pop. You going in the circle now? Hey, hey, hey. Let's go! Let's do it. OK, you're really twerking it. Come on, Alex, what's your gun do? OK, OK, OK. OK, I like what you're doing. Hey, hey. I'm going to get a little bit of a nice little bit of the rest of your family. OK. You're going to get a little bit of a nice little bit of the rest of your family. So, so much. Thank you so much, Ted Hoppe. APPLAUSE This is a dream come true. Thank you so much. APPLAUSE I don't know why I'm emotional, but I feel like we made history tonight, so thank you so much. APPLAUSE
