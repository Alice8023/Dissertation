 It blew off his magic! The best thing we can do from right now is to get that control panel back where it belongs. Where is it? I, uh... Give it to Shaggy and Scooby. That's weird. It sounded like you just said you give the Shaggy and Scooby. I think we lost him. Scooby, we made it wrong. You shone to help me down those loves. Now you're stuck in here with me. Look at the cave. Love. Cotton. Candy. Come on. Yes. On. On. Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! I'll give you candy. I don't see Shaggy and Scooby anywhere. The poor guys are probably running around helpless and terrified. This is like the greatest day of our lives, too. Finally, a month so we can sink our teeth into. Look at us, whom I'm kind of thirsty. I wonder if there's a leader's eye, soda glob anywhere. Come on, guys. We have to hurry. My food. We have to give this control panel back before. Before exactly that happened. I must say, have you mystery in you. You will never make it past my master. I take any jokes before, gang. Let's do it again. No! No! No! It's not, gang. You need to worry about me. You will. No, you are stalking my drug. Candy! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Soon your friends will be dead. And whose? It's destroyed. My revenge will be final. And there's nothing you can do about it. Well, well. Fight me. Ready... Skullæ°‘! I'm gonna lose it. I'm gonna lose it. I think Frostbite never felt so good. Stop them! Come on, Skump! Rummy! Rummy! Rummy, don't you know? Rummy! Rummy! Rummy, don't you know? Rummy, don't you know? Rummy, don't you know? Yay. Rummy. Numbly! Come here. Ride BDid DUDE Cruz! Ah! Ah! Look at this! Oh! Ah! Ah! Ah! Whoop! Uh-huh! Ah! Ah! It's a secret! Oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh! What are you doing, buddy? Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh! You can't do this to me! Who do you think you are? Scooby? Gooby? Go!
