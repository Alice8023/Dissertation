 The Tenercare Pass. Tell me that you found the scar. They're cutting you to it now. Ah, that's exciting. I've had them working around the clock since we are nerfed about two weeks ago. Good. Let's keep this thing airtight until we're ready to show the board. This court. This court? Oh, sorry. Dr. Santas, hello. Actually, that's not my name. How long do you think it's going to be? We hit this center before sunrise. Well, push your men harder. I've searched for 15 years. I don't want to wait another second. Should've called for making the trip out of this court. This could be another deacquired. It's in there. I can feel it. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. That's all, isn't it? All right, let's do this. Excuse me, sir. How do I look? Look, your six figures need debts. OK. You're going to have to have a look. Yes, I am. We say nothing for now. Let's enjoy this moment before he knows. I'll tell him. That's Loka. What the... why not? Even good news. Soren and like Bad news, when the two of you are this, it's Chata. And this is pretty bad news. I can be joyful. Your job is the balloon. Or I can handle it. Hand on one. Hi! Hi! You cannot drink this here. Hi. How was your flight? Are you hungry? Of course. Here. So they had. Welcome back, bro. Thank you. No! No! This is an encounter. I'm a little bit nervous. I'm going to be a little bit nervous. I'll find all the together. Now, we're off. Why? I love it. Hey, where's Uncle Rudy? And up there is me. My father and the baby. What's up, baby? I thought you had a love bomb with something. It's so me, Rudy! It's so me, what the fuck? How these boys? Hey, come on. Get out the car and give me a hug. No, no hugs, man. They got big brother watching those cameras. I knew you were going to send something. Facial recognition. Body imaging scanner. Yeah, and they're all so happy to finally catch you. You see? Is that kind of talk right there? I'm going to get us a whole busted. What'd you get this? I bought it for Hyland. Oh, boy. We know it's a boy. It's probably a bug in here. Come on. What are we doing? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I must have so much. Good or not, something's gonna change. Mom and dad have something to tell you. We'll get it. What? Hey, he's had his tacos. Now let him have the truth. The truth? What is it? We're losing the house. What? See? He didn't take it that bad. No, no, no, losing the house. What does he mean with us? The landlord tripped the rent. They gave us three months to come up with the money and get out. I'm so sorry if Lakito. No. I'm not. Don't be sorry. It's not your fault. It just means that we're going to have to bust our... ...the shop, right? Errr... Auto shops, car. How? You can thank Corp for that. Roll the air. We couldn't keep up. Especially since your dad... ...he...he...he...he...he... ...that had a heart attack. What? I'm fine. It's a bad thing, but... ...you're still here. At least the food is the same. What's the matter? Why didn't you tell me? You were working so hard, Mom. We didn't want to distract you from school. I could have done something. I could have come back. I could have... ...been here. I could have...I need more, Jaime. You did it out. We always do. We have a lot to be grateful for. Look, we're celebrating the first time... ...that we're celebrating in college. And the last! Yes, because you didn't apply. What, so I can get into debt for the rest of my life? No, thanks. What? 25%. Mom, these people make nothing. We are broke. It's worried about warning tomorrow. Remember how mom taught us salsa right there on the front porch? You were always better than me. Yeah, no, I still think you don't know how to do salsa. Yeah, I got two left feet. I can't help it. Do you remember your 21st birthday? I remember the first half. I can't believe we're losing this place. It was rough. Hello, I'm not leaving again. What about grad school? Well, that's not gonna help the family. I can't get us any even more, Dad. Honey, bro, hey, you always land on your feet. You're Jaime. Thank you, Mom. It wasn't how I was supposed to happen, maybe. What was supposed to happen? I was supposed to make it out. I was supposed to get all of us out of there. Thanks, bro, but I like the keys. You know what I meant. Yeah. Doesn't it bother you that they talk about progress and get everything? Well, we have to sit here and go broke? You're a Mexican in the edge, Guiz-Gadinal. That progress is not for us. Okay, the poor go over here and the rich go over there until the rich want to be here and push us out. We used to have the other side of the tracks and now they want that too. I still have a degree, right? That's gotta mean something. I'll get a job. Not just any job, but a prime job. Yeah, I'm gonna get the money to save this wish. Don't look at me like that. Really, I'm telling you, in five years, we're gonna be rolling in it.
