 In honor of 100 years of storytelling, Warner Brothers brought together a new generation of visual storytellers from around the world to reimagine the stories and characters that have inspired them and to celebrate their fandom through art. I believe film is so impactful telling stories that empower people to really feel better about them soon. Warner Brothers has created such iconic works that get to the heart of what storytelling is about. In the last 100 years of Warner Brothers stories, I've been very significant to my life. These are the characters I grew up with. Saturday mornings were like sacred, does it, was going to watch cartoons no matter what. I picked up the accent, I picked up the way they talk. And what's up, huh? I love the movies. You can be transported to this other reality. Warner Brothers, you grew up loving them, you grew up admiring them, and as an artist, you grew up wishing you could work for them, and it finally happens. I'm trying to capture the essence of an animation in still images by trying to represent a variation of a character. I can see it in your eyes. What if Asian people were super heroes and super heroines? Can I be like you someday? You can be anything you want to be. It's important for people to see themselves in the characters that they love. To be able to tell my friends that getting to draw a bug's bunny. That girl, take the North Hangar. The idea that I could add a little brush to it. I always told you, you're special. I want to show kids and people who dream of doing something that it could be possible. Click your heels three times, like the power is the side of you all the time. You'll be surprised what contributions you can make to humanity in a creative way. Thank you, Warner Brothers, for the 100 years of Star Talent. Wana Boudaza Sino Minasama. Wana Misa Lama, for Warner Brothers. Thank you for 100 years of amazing stories.
