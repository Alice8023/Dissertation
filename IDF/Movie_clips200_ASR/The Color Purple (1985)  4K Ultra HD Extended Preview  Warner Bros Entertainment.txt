Let me know what's happening to me. One day, my daddy comes to say, you're gonna do what your mama would it. Now, I got two children from my daddy. A baby boy called Adam. He took her out sleeping. And a baby girl called Olivia. They took right out my arms. Then my mama died, cussing the screaming. Cuz the heart then broke. I'm going to go. Dear God, he act like he can't stand me no more. I'll thank you, Kielpa, little baby boy. I already sold it to a preacher and his wife. I keep hoping he'll find somebody to marry. I seem looking at my little sister. She's scared. But I say, I'll take care of you with God help. Dear God, he come home with a girl from around a town called Gray. She'd be almost my age. But they can't marry now. My little sister, Nady. She's got a man always looking at her. His wife, Dad, she was killed by her boyfriend coming home from church. He got three children though. He seen Nady in church, and now every Sunday evening, here come Mr. It is therefore to be entered into lightly on its path, but reveredly and soberly, and in the field God, let us pray. Till long we ask your blessed home for the day they've had it. And you'll be free. Amen. I want to marry you, Nady. I've got to have somebody right now. I've got nobody to watch over my youngers. They's be fighting and bleeding and throwing up on the floor sometimes. Well, I've got to farm the run. Now, I'm going to take right good care of you. I'm going to have to go back to the hospital. I'm going to have to go back to the hospital. I'm going to take right good care of you, Nady. I can't let you have Nady. She's too young. What a tell you what? I can let you have Celia. She'd old as anyhow, she wanted to marry her first. She ain't fresh though, but I expect you to know that. She's spoiled. Twice. Celia is ugly, but she ain't no stranger to hard work. And she can learn. And God doesn't fix her. You can do everything just like you want to and you ain't going to make your feet of the clothes. But Nady, you flat out can't have nothing now, nothing ever. Well, I ain't never looked at the other one before. Let me see you again. Celia, best of all, I'll look at you. Move up. He won't bite.
