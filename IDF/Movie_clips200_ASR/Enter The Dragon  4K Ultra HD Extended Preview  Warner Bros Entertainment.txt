A woman like that could teach you a lot about yourself. Welcome. This way. I'll show you two rooms. The banquet begins promptly at 8. I think you'll find our little island quite charming. I'm going to have to go. Say, I hope you haven't spent all that money you won for me yesterday. I plan to went it back. Oh, how? You'll find out after you've lost it. You seem to be very much at home here, Mr. Ropa. This guy Hans got a great sense of hospitality. And a fantastic sense of style. Yeah, it's great. And why are you so apprehensive? Effrahensive? No, I was just wondering whether it was okay to drink the water. Mr. Ropa, don't call me. Want a bit? Hmm... No, I really don't think so. Thanks. It's not you, Ona Diet. I like to eat. If I could find something I could keep down. Well, I can't wait to meet our host. I hear this is only one of his beat parties. You ever been to a martial arts tournament like this? Never. I have a funny feeling with being fat enough for the kill. Better keep an eye out for the referee. You know what I mean? Yeah. You're a real man. You're a real man. You're a real man. You're a real man. You're a real man. You're a real man. You're a real man. Gentlemen, welcome. You are on our island. I look forward to a tournament of truly epic proportions. We are unique gentlemen in that we create ourselves through long years of rigorous training, sacrifice, denial, pain. We forge our bodies in the fire of our will. But tonight, let us celebrate, gentlemen. You have our gratitude. Oh, no. Oh! Oh! Oh, no. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! I'm going to get you a little bit more. I'm going to get you a little bit more.
