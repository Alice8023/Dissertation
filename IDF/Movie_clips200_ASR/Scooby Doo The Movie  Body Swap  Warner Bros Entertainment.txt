 Thanks, Shaggy. Oh boy, am I glad to see you. Now let me go so I can return to my body. And then get out of here before they find you and steal your protoplasm too. I'll lift you from here, Shaggy! Jakey! Ah! Jakey! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Hey! Hey! Hey! Ah! No! Hey buddy. Shaggy! Listen man. Someone must have spiked my route here last night. Talk me down man. Talk me down. Fred! You're a freaking protoplasm again. I know. But I'm still the best looking protoplasm get here. I mean, I'm not that good at this. I'm not that good at this. I'm not that good at this. I'm not that good at this. I can protoplasm get here. Are you trying to this thing? We're going to pop our watches on us. Gather our watches for the Sara money. Roger that! I'm coming. Just look here! Argh! Thank you so much, you saved me. Thank you. Sorry, I'm looking for my friends. I'll figure a way out myself. Like how? I don't know. I'll use my tongue as an orange swim to the edge. Sorry. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! You, yo. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! You can use a little sunlight! Oh! Sunlight. Oh. Oh. Yeah! Oh! Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! That's one part of the mystery solved. The creatures must need our bodies to survive in sunlight. Like a human suit. SPF. One million. But what are they doing here in the first place? Daphne, you okay? Yeah. But I'm not Daphne. Red? I couldn't get to my body. I didn't know where else to go. I pain it! It's not easy to steer when you're pure spirit. Hey! I can look at myself naked. No brother. Get your hands off me. Daphne, keep playing this somehow. Didn't he? Hey! Good luck, Harry. Fred, you egocentric. Please. Tell me you guys are you. Fred keeps touching me. I kinda make you nostalgic for the homicidal creatures, doesn't it? I still was. I hope it helps. The Damon Riders. Whoa! Whoa! Hey! I'm here again. Yippie for you. Man, why am I wearing a dress? Everyone remain calm. Della, the heck's going on. If my calculations are correct, due to the fragile nature of unstable protoplasm in the proximity of the Damon Riders, I'm simply going to continue randomly changing bodies until... Whoa! Whoa! ...until a protoplasm realigned with the appropriate bodies. I'm Fred again. Oh, Daph. What's wrong with you? Don't you ever eat? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Oh! Oh! I'm me! I'm back! Like me, too. Told you so. Oh no. Let's go.
