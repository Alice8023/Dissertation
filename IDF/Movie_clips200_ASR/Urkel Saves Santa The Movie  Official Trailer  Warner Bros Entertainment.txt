 Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh no! It's me, Steve Arkel. I just want this holiday season to be the 5th of December. Oops. I want everything to be perfect for the big guy when he arrives. Now who wants to head to the mall for their riding up the giant Christmas tree? Ow! What he said. Maybe there's a way to spread even more holiday season. Ah! I think I've got it. Make a good point! I built something that helps spread a little bit holiday season. Woo-hoo! Yes! I'm showing everybody that I got my day's hopes is like the holiday spirit without me. Missed! You've gained my pride being in the holiday spirit? Yes! Sanity points! Oh no, no. I do not like this idea. Oh! It's a small no! You built ancient power to reindeer. No! Sacrifice! Take this back to the mall! Right now! No! No! Then I do it! Oh! Hold on, I can fix this! No! Don't fix anything! Wanna go fix the holidays? Yes! You might be a little awkward, do you think? A pundling, fine-of-fingered clutch? I was gonna say eager. So we all know your heart will be in the right place. As long as we care about the people around you, it's the new officially healthy knee-spread holiday cheer. Dashing through that snow on our city bus. Nope!
