 For a moment, life doesn't seem quite so bad. For a moment, I kind of forgot to be sad. But, he turns night to day. But don't get carried away. Never let down your guard. Let them into your heart for a moment. Not for a moment. I got it, Yodo. Listen to this. Noodle, noodle, apple, spurt. Some people don't, and some people don't. All snakes, flamingos, bears and turtles. Singing this song will improve your mood. Noodle, DD, noodle, DD, don't. Singing this song will improve your mood. Singing this song will improve your mood. Noodle, noodle, noodle, don't. Singing this song will improve your mood. Singing this song will improve your mood. Singing this song will improve your mood. Music
