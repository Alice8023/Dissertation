 It is- We are Sealy! What's the matter with you? You got a fever? I didn't come out here for you to take all day to shave me. Get the molasses out your f***. What's your name? I'm a bitch. Get the molasses out your f***. It seems like the long I'm married to the slo-o you get the dumb-o you get. The air's just as slow as it is I ever see it in the slo-o. See that razor-stuffing? Get on out of here and do me right now. Get on out of here. Alright. Put your head back. Cut my name. Get your name out of here. Say that, say that. That razor looks dull to me, Missyly. Damn women.
