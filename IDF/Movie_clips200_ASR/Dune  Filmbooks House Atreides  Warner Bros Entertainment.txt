 House of Traides The noble House of Traides, science of kings, gods and legends alike. This great people is descended from Atreus, Greek God of War and King Agamemnon, ruler of my senai and storied warrior of the Trojan War on Earth. Like their four bearers, members of House of Traides, are born rulers. They're green and black crest, a shining beacon of the galaxy. They are viewed as friends of enemies, but never discounted and rarely unconsidered. We are House of Traides. There is no call. We do not answer. There is no faith that we betray. For generations, they call the planet of Caledon home. The third planet in orbit around star Delta pervones. Much of its surface is covered in vast oceans, allowing for aquatic ecosystems to flourish. During the Duchy of House of Traides, terrestrial agriculture thrived. As did fishing industries, it was considered a time of prosperity in Caledon. In the year 10191 AG in the waning days of Duke later Atreides rule, House of Traides was charged with taking control of the desert planet Arrakis, forcing Duke Atreides along with his son and heir to the title Paul Atreides, to lead a massive exodus from their ancestral home on Caledon. The Atreides take over at Arrakis and did 80 years of tyrannical rule by House Harkin, and sparked conflict between the two great houses that persists to this day.
