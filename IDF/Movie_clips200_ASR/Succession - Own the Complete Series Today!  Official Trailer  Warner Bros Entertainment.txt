 This life is not for everyone. It's a fight for a knife from the mud. Here's to us. Everything I've done, I've done from my tomb. Let the games begin. I always wondered when are you kids to take over? Maybe get a little experience of like a CVS. What do you have against me? You lack Killer and Stink. You're intellectually insecure. You have addiction. That's enough. I don't think all that. I'm just trying to be dad's voice. I need to know where everyone is and what everyone's thinking. Are you asking if you can blackmail me? I don't point. No comment. No comment. You don't have to say that, Greg. Roman is a knucklehead. I will give you $1 million if you hit a homerun. For real? Chiv is a fake. I may not love you, but I do love you. And Kenny is screwy. The patriarchy. If it is to be said, so it is. I love you, but you are not. It's an executive level business. Security. Serious people. Where will your father die? Yeah, a sundial with a stress signal. We're under attack. They can't believe what we did. And the fact that we did it. Here's to us. Shamsi, everyone knows. But nobody says. Bloody complicated life. You have to be a killer. Who said I never killed anyone?
