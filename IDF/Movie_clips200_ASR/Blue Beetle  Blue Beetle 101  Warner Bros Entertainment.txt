 Blue Beetle is a movie that we're building from the ground up. Yeah, buddy. And I think it's so exciting to get to a Malcoma the best parts from Hymes' story in the comics over the years. For a fun, good old movie. Oh, yeah! I never thought this story was going to be told, but I'm so happy because we've been waiting for it. I would hate to have not been involved in this project. Blue Beetle represents that we can all be our own superhero. Okay, let's do this. There's many versions of Blue Beetle in the comics. This time around, our Blue Beetle is a teenager called Hyme Reyes. Hi! Get me out of here! Blue Beetle is the origin story of the reluctant hero. What is going on? Hyme wants to secure a job, but instead, he's given this scarab, this alien-like form that happens to attach itself to Hyme. I think he likes me. What the hell? It's on him! He's scared of me! I swear I'm under the bed to death! That approach you. Oh, sign on that! The scarab grants him hours beyond belief. You are a superhero, Kaverot! Oh, I forgot how bad it looks. The real name of the scarab is Kadida, a weapon created by one of the most ancient civilizations in the cosmos. The suit's got an alien mind. It can make weapons that we don't even know exists. Let's go! Like, let me show you what I can do. Actually, let me show you what you can do. Whenever you can imagine, I can create. Nice choice. There's a beam that shoots out of it. There's bulletproof. Oh, my God, I'm bulletproof. The legs? Now you get ordered to that. You can go to space. The swords? I have a fight! The fact that you can... That's part of you. Sometimes we're granted opportunities. We don't feel fit for it. That's something really profound and something that hopefully will resonate. But my favorite part of it all is family. I'll come together. My family? That's what makes me fun. I'm a real man. I'm a real man. I'm a real man. I'm a real man. I'm a real man. I'm a real man. I'm a real man. I'm a real man. I'm a real man. I'm a real man. I'm a real man. I'm a real man. I'm a real man. I'm a real man. I'm a real man. I'm a real man. I'm a real man. I'm a real man. I'm a real man. I'm a real man.
