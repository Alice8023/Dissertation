 I've waited a long time for this. I'm supposed to know who you are. I just got into the high seas. You're the Aquaman. We were bound to meet at some point! That's not making it happen. Ow! I'm not a guy. Dad. That's your kid. Shame on you. We've got cells into this mess. We've got cells out of it. BEST DUDE! Wait! Help me, his trap! You can't leave it like that! Please! You killed innocent people. You're supposed to see for mercy.
