 This is the first time I've ever been to a place like this. I've never been to a place like this. I've never been to a place like this. I've never been to a place like this. I've never been to a place like this. I've never let you fit too low. If you could, we'd have fun and fly. And I'd know that we'll take you far. Life can never break your soul. Every day the sun don't shine at all. Keep moving, keep moving. It's up to you to wake you, choose a car. Keep moving, keep moving. Nothing's gonna take you down the path to start a girl. Life can never break your soul. Try it, try it, push it, aim it, smile it, take it in all. Everything's up to you to wake you, choose a car. Keep moving, keep moving, keep moving, keep moving. Nothing's gonna take you down the path, whatever we got. Life can never break your soul. If you could, we'd have fun and fly. And I'd know that we'll take you down the path to start a girl. Keep moving, keep moving, keep moving. Life can never break your soul. Thank you.
