 Hi, everybody. Cline. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. Ugh! Ugh! Hahaha! I killed you! AHHHHH! Ugh! Ugh! H Souls, Marion, Hosaurus, Hå“ª! Mmm! I was going to kill you. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Where are you? Ah! Ah! Ah! Something is it right? What is it right as we're taking too long? Every second we waste is one in which more could die. I'm going in, even if you're too scared. But she's no! Ah! Ah! It's hopeless. What could we against such magic? We're near the one who said good men stood against evil despite the odds. What is it? How did you know? I'm not sure. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Run! Give me the key. This is no time, hurry. You can't. I can. You know the rule when running from a beast. Be faster than the man you're with. Where is Warlord? Where is Warlord? Dead. Who are you? I... don't know. There was a wreck. I think and then Demos found me. Enough chatter! Help us out of here! We can still kill the wizard and save Scott Horace! No. I want no part of your quest. Besides, there's no time to save you. But there is enough time to save myself. I'm not going to save you. I'm not going to save you. I'm not going to save you. I'm not going to save you. I'm not going to save you. I'm not going to save you. I'm not going to save you. I'm not going to save you. I'm not going to save you. I'm not going to save you. I'm not going to save you. I'm not going to save you. I'm not going to save you. I'm not going to save you.
