I just like to smile, smiling's my favorite. Make work your favorite, that's your favorite, okay? Okay, work as your new favorite. Fine! Can you pass the maple syrup, please? I didn't put it. It's spaghetti. You know what? I think I have something. Yes. You like sugar, huh? Is there sugar in syrup? Yes. Then yes! We also try to stick to the four main food groups.
