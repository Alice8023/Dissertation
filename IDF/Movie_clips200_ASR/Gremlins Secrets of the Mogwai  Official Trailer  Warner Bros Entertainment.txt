 Magic is all around us. But you'll never see it if you don't go out and look. That is a map wide. Oh, why are the real resistical creatures? No model has seen one for centuries. Do you have a first name? First, Gitchmo. Gitchmo? Hi, Gitchmo. I'm Sam. This species is wildly dangerous. Never get them wet. No bright light. And never feed them after midnight. Oh, no! Our only concern should be the boatwite falling into the wrong hand. Who's that? The wrong hands. Where is my mokwai? These creatures may prove useful in mind, ever since. First, Shanghai, then the world. If we don't save Gitchmo, who will? Don't get us! We need to return Gitchmo to his home to save humanity. You'll never catch Sam. We are dealing with creatures who want chaos. I simply need to channel their destructive energy. We're the only ones who know how to do this. If we don't end it here, the world becomes a ghost city. How many monsters did you slay today, huh? Same as always. Zero.
