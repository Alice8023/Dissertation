 It won't be ok. Cr Les. Hey where'd this come from? I found it. Well, let's first find it. You really don't want me to play. Captain Hadi said now. It's Captain Hadi. You're gonna die if there. I need reassignment. You're the best I've got. I've lost my face. Is there someone inside you? Sometimes. Who is it? I don't know. Is it Captain Houghty? You've never heard of exorcism? How do you go about getting an exorcism? I beg your pardon. I'm Damien Karras. I'd like to help you. Where's Regan? In here with us. I believe we should begin. Revoid conversations where the demon is. The demon is a liar. You will make slives with the truth. Why, you be me. To attack us. Do not listen. I'm a dead thing. This is my daughter. I can see you'll come at you. The whole Christ will help you. There's an excellent day for an exorcism.
