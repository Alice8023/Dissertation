 Hey you. Come here. I want to talk to you. What do you want to talk to me about? How come you were in the women's locker room this morning? I heard you singing. You sure had nothing to do with the fact that I was naked in the shower? I didn't know you were naked. Why were you here so early? They shot my water off. What were you doing here so early? Building this? You built this? They're kind of pissing about this. Hey guys. Have you seen the place? That's pretty good. It's a little too good. Corporate must have sent in a professional. I don't know why somebody's gone in for my job. But look, let's remain a team. Okay? Because if I go, we all go. If you get wind of anything, calm me on my radio. Channel 3. Code word is, Santa's got a brand new bag. Okay? Six inch ribbon curls, honey. That's impossible. Six inches. By the way, I think you have the most beautiful singing voice in the whole wide world. Santa. Ha ha! Ha ha! Yeah! It's me, honey! It's me! Who the heck are you? What are you talking about? You're Santa Claus. No, you're not. Well, of course I am. You're Santa. What song did I sing for you on your birthday this year? Happy birthday, of course! Oh, so how old are you, son? Oh, you're a big boy. What's your name? Poor. And how can I get you for Christmas? Don't tell him what you want. He's a liar. Let the kid talk. You disgust me. How can you live with yourself? Just cool, Zippy. You sit on a throne of lies. Look, I'm not kidding. You're a fake. I'm a fake? Yes. How'd you like to be dead? Huh? Zippy's kidding. You stink. I think you're gonna have a good Christmas, all right? It's not like beef and cheese. You don't smell like Santa. Okay. Oh! He's a fag! He's a fake! He's a fake! He's a fake! Come here! I swear! Come here! He's a fake! Go! Go! Run! Run! Run! Run! Arrgh! Come on! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Go! Run! That's the best! That's zero plus! That's the best! He's not fairer. you
