 On the Warner Brothers Backlot, Tenamit Street has allowed filmmakers to shoot New York in the warmth of Los Angeles for decades. The only parts of the street that come from New York are its fire escapes, which were trucked across the country in the 1930s to bring authenticity to films like James Cadenes, Angels with Dirty Faces. You don't know anything about this scene? No, I don't know. But you don't know what guys get to talk. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Film makers through the years have made Tenamit Street their own, as Alfonso Cuad√≥n did for a little princess, painting an entire block green to match the eyes of his 10-year-old leading lady. Turn of the century Manhattan came to sinister life on Reimsoke Tenamit Street for House of Wags, Warner Brothers' first 3D movie. In better weather but no less sinister, confessions of a Nazi spy found Tenamit Street this setting for espionage. Just another Mr. Mitchell, we want to talk to you. What about this package? After almost half a century, Tenamit Street was renamed to the 1980s in honor of legendary production designer Dale Hennessy, whose last film, The Big Budget Musical Annie, was shot here. The sign has been known as Hennessy Street ever since. A few years after its renaming, Martin Riggs and Roger Murtoff chased bad guys through Hennessy Street's narrow confines. He crawled into the trunk. Yeah, get your coffee. For Batman Returns, Batman Forever and Batman Oralman, Hennessy Street was a dark and moody Gotham city. That's not Batman. What are you talking about? That's a bad boy. The street became a mysterious Chinatown where cuttley pets aren't quite what they seem in gremlins. And Hennessy Street finally got to play itself a Hollywood movie set for the Oscar-winning Argo. For almost 90 years, through good times and bad, anything can happen on Hennessy Street.
