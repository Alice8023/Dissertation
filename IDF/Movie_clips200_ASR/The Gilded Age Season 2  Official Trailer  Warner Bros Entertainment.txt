 Your York is where society puts itself on display. The leaders meet each other and their children court each other. The old guard thinks they can keep out the new people with impunity. But nothing stays the same forever. Change came from the American Revolution, but it was difficult to live through all the same. I intend to bring the great city of New York, the Opera House it deserves. The old members of the academy are very determined. It should not succeed. You'll need to pick a team. That's it. Head to head and one will be the winner. Mrs. Russell is even more of a fighter than I had realized. Is there any chance I could come back to 61st Street? Tegas would welcome you back with open arms. I never dreamt that I might still fall in love, but I wonder what admiss will think. Because in Darshan, he's taken a real interest in Mariam. But I don't just want a husband on data. Is rich? He's even handsome. What more could a girl ask for? Recovering the opening of a new school in Tuscany. You have never been south. I need to show the world there. I call it people making something of their lives. Things are worse than I thought. Your workers are paid barely enough to put food on the table. Why must I be the villain in every story? I have lifted whole towns out of poverty. You're making a terrible mistake. Stop being so selfish. I won't be put in a cage. Have you forgotten that you lived here at my pleasure? I'm afraid we have a serious problem. I cover all your backs with who's covering mine? There are no guarantees anymore. And that's what this is. You seem to have won the first battle. I intend to win the war. Please. Thank you.
