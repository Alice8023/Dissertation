 Get a move on, breakfast is ready. Oh, you made breakfast since when do you make breakfast? Since it's our special day. It's our anniversary. Not exactly. Look what I made. No offense. Sausage and peas, french fries, white toast, apple pie, and coffee. I thought you were crazy. I think I was too. And today's the anniversary of that day. How many years? Oh, who knows. But it was the best day of my life. Oh, mine too, honey. How everything turned out. No regrets? None whatsoever. I love our life together. Now eat that disgusting slap before it gets cold. And then we better get to work. What's going to happen? Well, I only have to remember it, but it always happens the day we get married. Something major. Well, what do we do about it? I'm not sure. But it's all going to be fine. We're going to spend our lives together. Grow old together. I promise. You can't promise that, Barry. I can't. You're probably wondering how I got roped into this, aren't you? Well, not a lot of people know this, but my father passed her the smallest church in him, Chunga Province, it's amazing. No church jet, or church bus, or church walls, for that matter. Just the most precious resource of all. People. I never saw my father happier than when he was uniting people together like this. And I've never seen two people more united than Iris West and Barry Allen. Oh, this is the thing. Yeah, I figured. Barry Allen of Earth One, you are needed. It's okay, everybody. She's with me. This is... I am Harbinger. Your world is in terrible danger. Come with me. And I get that. But waiting an hour to really make that big a difference. I've been sent together Earth's greatest champions. You're collecting all the heroes, is that right? Well, we've got green arrow, Vixen, green lantern, right here. We can save you like five trips. What do you say? Flash. Working for the Nazis didn't do you any favors. We have not met. I hail from an Earth almost completely covered by water. Thanks to your surfaced woathers. Bruce! Look at you. We're almost the same age. Do I know you? It's Dick. Dick Grayson. Robin? The Flying Grayson's. Tony Zuko. Yes. On my Earth, you took me in after my parents murder. Trained me. I became your partner. I... that seems terribly irresponsible. Maybe. But you... He became my family. We helped a lot of people. I'm sorry. This must be so weird to you. And I apologize for this, but there's someone here who really wants to meet you.
