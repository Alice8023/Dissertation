 The mighty Psycho Pirate, you've a role to play in the crisis to come. RUN! I've got contact. Code Red. Kara, your friends are in mortal peril, but there is something we can do. Reporting an unusual development from Earth 2. Let there be life! And there was life! We've got about a million other demons. These attacks continue to come in all universes to each of their Earth. What we thought was an anti-matter tsunami turned out to be an ongoing storm without any predictable pattern. Wave, ho! Another universe lost. You think it just happened to be in the neighborhood when your planet blew up. What do you say? What have you done? I'm just broadcasting hate, fear, distrust. You've made a mystery out of my adolescence. We need to fight the shadows, not each other. You're the only one who can save the universe. How? Fight back. I was wrong about it all. All living things in all realities are about to die. Welcome now. What have I done?
