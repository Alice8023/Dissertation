A bus rolled over several times, or a settle bottled a hill here. I don't know if I passed out or what. When I looked up, the train was bearing down. I don't know how it's still kind of hazy, but somehow I grabbed him and I pushed him out of the bus. You're a brave man. You could both been killed. Yeah, I know. But, yeah, he's my partner. He would've done the same for me. Excuse me, Sheriff. I'm deputy United States Marshal Samuel Gerard. I'd like to talk to you. I'll be with you in just a minute. Okay. One more time, just for the record, these three are dead. Yeah. And this one? Everything happens so fast. No, I don't think you made it. Well, looks like you came a long way for nothing. With all due respect, Sheriff Rollins, I'd like to recommend checkpoints on a 15 mile radius at I-57, I-24. And over here on Route 13, we'll wait a minute. The prisoners are all dead. And the only thing checkpoints are going to do is get a lot of good people frantic around here, and flood my office with call. Well, shit, Sheriff. I'd hate to see that happen, so I guess I'll take over your investigation. He's on what a thard? Governor of the State of Illinois, United States Marshal's Office, Fifth District, Morgan Illinois. All right, fun. You want jurisdiction over this mess? You got it. Okay, boys, get around here and listen up. We're shutting it down. Why it hurts here to mop up there? There you go with that knee, damn. Oh, wow, G-Wiz, look here. You know, we're always fascinated when we find leg irons with no legs in them. Who the hell the key, sir? Me? Where those keys are?

He got out of the house. Listen up, ladies and gentlemen. Our fears you did has been on the run for 90 minutes. Average foot speed over on even ground barring injuries four miles an hour that gives us a radius of six miles. What I want out of each and every one of you is a hard target search. For every gas station, residents, warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, outhouse, and doghouse, in that area. Checkpoints go up in 15 miles. Your fugitive's name is Dr. Richard Kimball. Go get him.
