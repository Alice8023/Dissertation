 Martian Manhunter, Vixen, Green Arrow, Flash, Batman and myself could not be more thrilled or humbled at your trust and confidence in us. But I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that this is all truly due to the efforts of Central City's Scarlet Speedster, the Flash. Oh, thank you, Superman. Yes. And I suppose you'd like to perhaps reveal the name of this exciting first ever super team right now. Right Flash? The name. Yeah, of the team, yes. Yes, it is the Justice League. The Justice League. Oh, my God. Hold me. There's a shard of wood headed for the Green Arrow's head on it. Wait, who's talking to me? I've absorbed Admiral Energy to allow communication at excessive speeds. Okay, skipping over the inherent weirdness here, why are you doing this? A projectile and dangerous Batman. Please clarify your inquiry. Why do you show concern for our safety while you're in the middle of an attack on us? A faulty interpretation. Attack is contrary to primary function. What is your primary function? Primary function, designated by Professor Evo, is to prolong and improve human life. Training Superman will not prolong or improve his life. Ah! New mission parameters indicate that Superman is not human. You're endangering all of these lives. You didn't do that last time. You were careful. What happened? What is Evo telling you now? Mission parameters had been amended by new best friend. You're the best friend, I presume. Oh, thank you, Justice League. Prioritize integration. You're the best friend, I presume. Oh, thank you, Justice League. Prioritize integration of Superman's energy. Sensors indicate Superman's vital signs are precarious. This is inconsistent with my programming. I believe you'll find my orders are compliant with new code I provided. Now, do it! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Move this battle suit complicates this situation. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! What are you doing calling in an air strike? It's our best option. Turning downtown, the trapless, into a war zone cannot be the best option. We have to act now, while Flash still retains some of his speed. Start dropping bombs? It's too dangerous. The civilians. We'll be cleared out. We have to destroy that AI before it gets too powerful. Don't confuse weakness with compassion. You're the one who's confusing brutality for strength. Confused. That's what Amazzo is. What he needs is... wait right here.
