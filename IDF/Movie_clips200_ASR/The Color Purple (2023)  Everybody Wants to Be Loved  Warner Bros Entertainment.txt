You see God is in music and water and in sunlight. God be, He be as big as the sun. Yet small enough to fit in all our hearts. The abode one man, if God loved me, then why you take my babies? And why you take my netty? It's not like men did that, but not God. What? Papa! Miss Ceilis! Ceilis! Papa! Look at you! Oh my goodness! Papa!
