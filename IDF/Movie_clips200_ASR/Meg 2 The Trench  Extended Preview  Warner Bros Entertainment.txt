They're not toys. They figure ants. They are definitely toys, dogs. Thank you. Ready for the drop guy? The Sir, you in style like Comic Con guys? Who what? Uh, absolutely right, yeah. Do you, um, dress off? Uh, yeah? Don't get him started unless you want to see a million photographs. Oh, yes, please. Stay focused, guys. Passing 17,000. The line of trees good? It's a beautiful day in the night bar. Passing 18,000 feet, all systems nomin' on. Looking good, team. Let's pull up the grid we're going to map today. Erroring team. We're never going to look at something different. Yeah, there's like a hundred more sectors to explore. Jonas, can you confirm 02 levels? Consumption is 11% of a mission spec. It's reguses. Of us. More like you're a mouth breather. I need to do these. Can you feel the breeze from over here? Yeah. Firstly, it's going to deviate the septum. Second, they still remember deviating it while saving your engraved thoughts. 70 full payload on. Passing 20,000 feet approaching the thermocline. Checking out two lines in tank pressure. If there was a leak there, you'd fluctuation on the reading. I'm not seeing anything here. Check the pressure on the auxiliary owe two tanks. That's not the problem. Uh, Jonas. Megan? You got one more. We've got to be kidding me. I see they're angry, but I believe that this is a reasonable and responsible decision. Stop the time. Full stop? So before you start yelling, can I just say? I didn't all kinds of stupid things when I was 14. Look how I turned out. What's surfacing? But I don't see what the problem is. This is your 26 trench die without incident. Slubs have electric predator countermeasures and emergency dive suits. What you don't have? Actually. I packed one more you doing the pre-dive meeting. You know, a mask maybe you've been talking to, uh, sit out on it. So be quiet, women. I can do a C-Bub on myself, you know. I know you can. Jonas? It's no your call, you mean? We've got cobbling. Guys, it's a mag. Approach your past. That's not possible. They can't go through the thermocline. It's not come from the thermocline. I'm tracking it from the shore. Die, flank speed! Engage it. Be rallying battery. Hold on. Charging the fed and account of measures. We'll be dead before the wrong lights. Thermoclines are only open. I'm reading hei-chees trucker. Impossible. Well impossible, Jiz got possible. 500 meters to the thermocline. Hei-chees closing fast. 100 meter. She's right above us. What? Answering the thermocline. Die one, die two. Switch the low frequency line. You don't want to attract any more mix. I've lost her. She can't follow through. Can't she? Going dark. I've never crashed the thermocline at 60 knots. Careful, you don't want to brawl the engines. Don't worry, I'm not going to break the pretty toys. Yes. She's still on us. 30 seconds for the countermeasures. The facet. She must have followed our heat signature. What did your pet shark get down here, Jimmy? She must have escaped. How did that happen? But did a countermeasure that do? The proximity alert. Makes. Oh, wait. That's the biggest man I've ever seen. Biggest man got anyone's ever seen. It's got to be the apex predator. Incredible. Mixer or solitary. It's like they're being called. I'm changing the dive plan. We have to see what they're up to. I'm worried about my eating. Well, I thought we'd go. What's that? Oxygen is our right maximum. Predator countermeasures are deployed. Right now, we are perfectly safe. Right now, yeah. I see anything dangerous. Back, we're changing the mission profile. We're sending all heading due to silent. No, they're already off mission. They need to stay on course. You're on a shoot going way outside the sector we've already met. This is an exploration mission. Let's explore. Copy that. I'll start from what you're back. Really, Matt? We're going to follow some giant sharks who are unknown sector. This will dumbass mark my words. Entering sector 21. The Comminthing geographical scale. So beautiful. You've not allowed this place more than anything. We've got to find a way to see it. Don't get used to it. Your ground is for the rest of your life. I love you too. I cheer for you when I need it ahead of the morning. Where are we going now? Into the unknown. That's what we came for. I've got Hachis tracker ahead. Looks like she's circling. Look out. Is something stink-shrug gathering? Incredible. They're here to meet. That's why Hachis has been acting strangely. Right. Well, thanks. The scanner's detecting an abnormal structure. The way is that a wreck? Some kind of sea floor station. What could they be doing down here? Really, the swarrow spectrons. No, that's no wreck. I'm getting heat signatures off it.
