 We originally played around a lot with a more dull look. Trying to have subtle, contouring and wear her joints would be if she was a doll. Maybe face was lighter than the body. And ultimately, it was a fun idea, but you didn't really want to look at that for two hours. Best of you not think about it too much. So we went back to the idea of just every Barbie and every Ken should look like the most beautiful, pretty version of themselves. The great thing I was discussing at first, they're possibly she would just have one look. And then very quickly, as we started discussing the story more and more, we realised really that she needs to have many, many different looks and basically depict many types of stereotypical Barbie. Yes! Hi! Hi!
