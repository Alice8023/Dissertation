 Do you have a good girl? You should be asleep. Did he come yet? I've been waiting for such a long time and I haven't seen a thing. Do they all come? Santa Claus. Now you know he's not going to come until you're asleep. How will he know how to find his next year? He's so used to coming for you. Oh, you can't fool him. You can find anybody he wants to find. It's Santa Claus brings me any toys. I'm taking them with me. I'm taking all my dolls. That's one's too. I'm taking everything. Of course you are. I'll help you back on myself. You don't have to leave anything behind. Except your snow people, of course. We look pretty silly trying to get them on the train one way. I'm taking all my dolls. I'm taking all my dolls. I'm taking all my dolls. I'm taking all my dolls. I'm taking all my dolls. I'm taking all my dolls. I'm taking all my dolls. I'm taking all my dolls. I'm taking all my dolls. I'm taking all my dolls. I'm taking all my dolls. I'm taking all my dolls. I'm taking all my dolls. I'm taking all my dolls. I'm taking all my dolls. I'm taking all my dolls. I'm taking all my dolls. Well, Chip, give me some water. How much more water? Sw syrup. If you can pay the bills, painkillers. Boy, bless me, yeah. stake me.ms. We need to wash once more. Someday soon we all will be together, if the face no longer. Until we will have to model through some hope. So help yourself, a merry little Christmas. Now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No one is going to have a good time. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What's the matter, Parker? Nothing dear. Nothing. Everything's fine. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Rose! Grandpa! Esther! What is it? What is it, Anna? What's it, Laura? What is it, Laura? What's it, Laura? What's it, Laura? It's all over there. It's all over there. It's all over there. I've got a few words to say. We're not moving to New York. I don't want to hear a word about it. We're going to stay right here. We're going to stay here, but we're not. We haven't, but we haven't, but we haven't. What would you say to Mr. Fenton? I've changed my mind. I'm a junior partner of Fenton, not a puppet on a string. If they don't like it, that's just too bad. They'll have to like it. But, Lonnie, you did think it was a fine opportunity, didn't you? New York hasn't got a copyright on opportunity. Why say it's a fool who makes your head swim? This is a great town. The trouble with you people is you don't appreciate it because it's right here under your noses. The grass is always greener in somebody else's yard. Rosemuth, we can't go on like this any longer. I've positively decided we were going to get married at the earliest opportunity, and I don't want to hear any arguments. That's final. I love you. Very Christmas. Anna, who is that boy? Val Lonnie, he's a very fine young man. We'll talk about it later. That young man so excited he's liable to leave on his honeymoon without roads. Rosemuth has a whole thing magnificent, but he's just putty in your hands. Road, I hope you'll be very happy. I'd like to meet that boy sometime. Thank you.
