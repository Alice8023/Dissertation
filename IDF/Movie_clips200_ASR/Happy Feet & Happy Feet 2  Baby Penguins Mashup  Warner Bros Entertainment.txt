 You know this is everything okay? I don't know. I can't hear anything. Is it empty? Honey. Can I have it? Here we are. It's okay, Marie. It happens sometime as Memphis. Yeah. Yeah. Wait, you hear that? Yeah. I can hear you, but who your pop is here? It's okay. Oh, he's okay, Marie. He's got... Oh, that's his little foot there. Oh, there's his other one. That's different. Hey, come back here, Mr. Mamba. Oh, she can go up there with her sheela. Oh, little bumble. Oh, Mamba. Mamba. Are you okay? Weezy. Weezy. Oh, you get used to it. Malson, come here there. What do you make of that? A little wobbling in the knees, huh? Is it okay? I don't know. What are you doing there, boy? I'm happy, Pa. What are you doing with your feet? I'm so happy, too. I wouldn't do that around, folks, son. Why not? Well, it just ain't penguin, okay? Okay. Come on over here. Get on here. Get warm. Watch the beak. Watch the beak. Beesh! Okay. Good morning, car. Good morning, Mr. Spiegelberg. Right. Well, today we begin with the most important lesson you will ever learn at penguin elementary. Does anyone know what that is? Anyone? Anyone? Anyone? Someone? See you all? The ship? No. Mamba. Don't eat yellow snow. No, that's not necessary, no? It's a heart song. Thank you, Gloria. Yes, yes. Without our heart song, we can't be totally penguin, can we? No. But my dear, it's not something that I can actually teach you. Does anybody know why? Anyone? Anyone? You can't. Teach it to us, ma'am, because we have to find our heart songs all by ourselves. Well done, you. It's the voice you hear inside. Yes. You truly are. Yes, thank you, Gloria. Excellent, lovely. Thank you. So, that's all we'll be very still now. Take a moment and let it come to you. I thought we were going to meet. What are you talking about? Me? Get Seymour. Don't push me, because I am close to the edge. I'm trying not to lose my hair. Yes, I like that one. I could really get to you that, lovely. I'm ready. I got one. I thought you might, Gloria. Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of those for me, more than they get. They like to have a bad hand to a penguin who has laid too many. That's as far as I got so far. Oh, yes, lovely. Really lovely. Well, mumble, since you seem so keen to share. Mine's sort of a bloom in a... Oh, my dear. In a bloom. You heard that, you know? Do you like it? Do you have a faith that's not even a tune? It's bad? No, dear. A tune is like... Oh, okay. Who is that? That is the offspring of Memphis and Norma Jean. Ah, though we hip-toe hopper. La la la la la la la la la! It's not funny! No, they're not in the least. A penguin without a heart song. It's hardly a penguin at all. Oh! It's from my ears. Come on, come on. Can't sing. Can't sing rubbish darling. Every little penguin has a song. When I have finished, your singing will be giving everyone the good speed. No, to begin. First, we must find a feeling. Happy feeling. So the feeling may be only feeling. You feel it? Good. Now, let it out. Bispontanias! Not what is that? I'm being spontaneous. Darling, you want to meet a beautiful girl. You want to make the egg? Oh, yes. Sing! And no jiggy jack! Do not move the muscle. No moving. You can go to the lift. Stop! Enough! Okay. We go back to the top. Forget, buddy. Look inside the soul. Feel the feeling. It's enormous feeling. So enormous. It feels all body. It must be straight. Are you extort? Open your little beak. Yes, yes. Lift up the head, that's it. Stop! Disaster! Catastrophe! I never fell before. Never! Never! We will go. We will go. We will go. But darling, I'm sure it's happening. I'm sure it's happening. No, Papa. This is so unfair. After all you have done, you really deserve better. Nothing makes sense in this world. It's a big pile of crazy. And the kings are all fools. Where is the unknown? Where a soul and promise is just a pretty light. And the mighty luck that page of the humble. Although he's just an ordinary penguin. My daddy talked to me. You don't need to be a soul. To be a great heart. You don't need to fly. To be a son. My hero. My son. You
