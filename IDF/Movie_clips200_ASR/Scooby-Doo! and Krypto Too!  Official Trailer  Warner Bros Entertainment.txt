More powerful than a locomotive, just like Superman. Oh no! We're sealed in! All you have to do is unmask this phantom before all these out of control villains destroy the world. Giganta! Those Cotonian excites! Solomon Grundy. No! Let's move on. Rats ride. Rift-o-oh, ride! All right, we have to look for clues. What's the point? What's the point of any of this? Why am I trapped in here with a bunch of annoying kids? Rift-o-oh! Rift-o-oh! Yeah! Super-duper! Ooh-hoo-hoo! Flames come. Ah! Ah! Super! Ah! Who's a good boy? Oh, yeah, good boy!
