 Hey, where does come from? I found it. Where? Close it. You been playing with her? Yep. You know how? How should I do? Wait a minute. You need to. Hey, y'all. I think we're all at time. Oh, yeah. Well, let's both put it in. You really don't want me to play, huh? No, I do. Captain Howdy said no. Captain Who? Captain Howdy. Who's Captain Howdy? You know, I make the questions and he does the answers. Oh. Captain Howdy, huh? I see. Nice. Oh, I bet he is. Yeah, I'll show you. Captain Howdy, did you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy. Captain Howdy, that isn't very nice. Maybe sleeping. You think? What? Wake up. Why are you beating that stuff? I've had a bad life. It's not even a good picture of you. You look so mature. You were talking. You were talking. Well, I did know they were taking it. Didn't have my makeup on there. I'm taking my lash off your face. Okay. Oh, I didn't get it. What are we going to do on your birthday? It's not nice. It's on Sunday this year. No work. What can we do? And I don't know. Well, what would you like to do? Got any ideas? Let me think. Let me think. What can we do? Hey, you know, we never finish seeing all the sides of Washington. We didn't get to Lee Mansion. Lots of stuff. Should we do that? Go side-scene? It's a nice day. Yeah. It's okay. And tomorrow night. I'll take you to a movie. Okay? No, I love you. I love you, ex. We have a good day, yeah? You can bring Mr. Dennings, if you like. Mr. Dennings? Well, you know, it's okay. Well, thank you very much. But why on earth would I want to bring Burke and your birthday? You like him. Yeah, I like him, don't you like him? Hey, what's going on? What is this? Huh? You're gonna marry him, aren't you? Oh my god. You're gonna marry Burke, Dennings. Don't be silly, of course not. Would you ever get an idea like that? But you like him. Of course I like him. Like pizzas, too, but I'm not gonna marry him. You don't like him like Daddy? Rick, and I love you, Daddy. I always love you, Daddy, Annie. Okay? Burke just comes around here a lot, because... Wow, he's lonely. Don't cut nothing to do. Well, I heard differently. Oh, you did. What did you hear? Huh? I don't know. Oh, come on, just stop. You didn't take so much. I had to get enough. Because Burke and I are just friends. Okay? Really? Okay. I'm ready for sleep. Right. Good night, Annie. It's my mother-town. She's alone, and I wish I'd left her. At least in New York, I'd been nearer and be close to her. You could see her by the transfer, didn't you? I need reassignment, Tom. I went out of this job. It's wrong. It's not good. You're the best we've got. Am I really? It's more than psychiatry, and you know that, Tom. Some of their problems come down to faith. A vocation, meaning of their lives, and I can't cut it anymore. I need out, and I'm on foot. I've lost my faith, Tom. Hello. Yes, this is Mrs. McNale. Operator, you have got to be kidding. I have been on this line for 20 minutes. Jesus Christ, can you believe this? He doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for f***ing. The circuit is busy. Oh, circuit's my f***ing. He doesn't give a f***. How you let me f***. No, I've got it, Sharon. It's all right. Yes. No, operator, don't tell me there's no answer. It's the hotel excelsior in Rome. Would you try it again, please, and let it ring? Hello? Yes. No, operator, I've given you the number four times. What do you do taking a literacy test? Get that job for f***ing. Don't tell me to be close. I've been on this f***ing line for 20 minutes. Yeah. You're kidding me. Okay. I thought you were going to be a little bit more patient. I'm going to be a little bit more patient. I'm going to be a little bit more patient. Okay. I thought I just went to bed. Yeah. Hey, what are we doing since 61? Okay. I'll just remind you of that little belt. I'll see. What are you doing here? My bear was shaking. I can't get to sleep. Honey. Honey. Honey. Shit. Yeah, stick of seaweed in five ounces. Ow! Oh, no! This is neither my hand nor no sweat. Oh, Carl. Jesus Christ called him to that. Very sorry, but you'll see. Norrets. Norrets. Thanks a lot. That's terrific. You
