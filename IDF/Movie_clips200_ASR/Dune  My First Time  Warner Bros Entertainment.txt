 A still suit is a high efficiency filtration system. Even this early in the morning, you would survive two hours without one of these. It cools the body and recycles the water lust to sweat. Your body's movements provide the power. Inside the mask you'll find a tube to allow you to drink the recycled water. In good working order, your suit won't lose more than a thimble full of water a day. Most impressive. Let's have a look at you lad. You've won a still suit before. No, this is my first time. Your desert boots are fitted slip fashion at the ankles. Who taught you to do that? It seemed the right way. Well, I'll let you see a bit cooler. Are you from it? I am accepted in both seats and village. No. Come and see the spy sands on which your livelihood depends.
