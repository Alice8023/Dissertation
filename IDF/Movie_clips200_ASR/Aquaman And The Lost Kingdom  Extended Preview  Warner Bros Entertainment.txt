 I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you go. It's OK. It's just ok. It's just OK. How are you? I don't know. I don't know. Hey. Some people think that makes me a joke, but I don't care. You know what? Because I'm also good at something else. And that's breaking his head. Poppa took on all the pirates. She's like, what the pirate ski's done? Hey, don't run, run, run, run. Those trumpletters didn't stand a chance. Poppa kicked your ass and took her name. Poppa, stop. Sorry, pops. My bad. Oh yeah, this is my son, Arthur Jr. She four years ago, everything changed. I met a woman, I fell in love. The next thing I know, we're getting married and having a kid. This little guy is the best thing that ever happened to me. This kid, he doesn't sleep. Oh. And you never miss this. And then I'm gonna crack a dawn because on top of getting married and having a kid, I finally got a job. That's right. I'm the king of frickin' Atlantis. How'd I score that, you asked? Well, I stopped my brother's arm from attacking the surface world. And in doing so, I claimed the throne from him. At first, I was like, Turnin' on Morton's alone. But then, as it turned out, being king wasn't all that cracked up to be. It's just meetings all day in politics. I'm so bored, I don't even know which end of the Bryan King I'm supposed to be looking at after time. Woo! Yeah! That's awesome. And if that's not bad enough, it turns out there's this whole council of houses thing that nobody told me about, which basically gets to shoot down everything I want to do. The only thing that makes all the hard work is sleep this night's worthwhile, is hanging with my little man. Ha-ha-ha! Yes. And of course, there are fun parts of the job. I get to keep the sea safe the best way I know how. Especially when I get to take down the legal case fighter, too. But for everything I get right, something else gets screwed up. Ah, fuck. Oh, don't you be wild. Yeah. Yeah, you go. Ah! It's not true. So, he's got a little brother or sister to play with. He's got a dog. Hey, I'm serious. I saw how lonely it was for you going up, when only a child. I always regret it, I couldn't get you that. Yeah, well, I'll be two hundred of yourself. Turns out I have a brother, and he's a total dickbag. Come on. Your relationship with all of them isn't how it usually is. Cheer siblings, bicker and fight. But at the end of the day, they're family. You should be able to count on them for help. Yeah, well, I'll still take the dog away any day. Look at that. Holy crap. I'm gonna go. Hi, baby boy. Are you talking to the fishes? Oh, man. Pops is blowing my mind. The whole life I wanted to share this gift for someone. Yeah, two of me, son. We're different. We're special. We're connected to the land and the sea. I can't wait to introduce you to all the majestic creatures on our planet. And so you hope awesome this will can be? Yeah, you and me. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. Across reference, the coordinates from Dr. Shen. Nothing. Still no sign of a plant in remnants and that the ice. Looks like he's led us on another wild goose chase. Every day I don't fix my power suit as another day aqua man gets to live. Check again. We're close this time. I can feel it. Expedition log day 463, Dr. Steven Shen recording. My quest for Atlantis has brought me to the end of the year. The avocane is losing his patience. If I don't turn up the Atlantean technology he's looking for soon, they're probably going to. You know what, let's not even go there. I'm sure everything will be fine. I'm sure he's going to be fine. If I go there I'm sure everything will be fine. Dr. Shen, take a look at this. Please tell me you found something. Size make a race going crazy. Where's the epicenter? Standing on it. Comedians. Fire!
