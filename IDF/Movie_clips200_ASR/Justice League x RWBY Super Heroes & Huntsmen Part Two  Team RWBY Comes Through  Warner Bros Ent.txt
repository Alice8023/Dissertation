 I thought your family's old labs were abandoned. They are, but they have the computers with the type of processing power cyborg needs. Who could kill Gorgi working with? We need more information. We go to their world, figure out who Kill Gorgi is working with, eradicate the Grims, save Batman, and be back in time for our own apocalypse. I guess that's as good a plan as we ever have. What was that like two minutes? Try two seconds. Ugh, this hurts my head. Okay, wise, you're gonna need to... Wise! That! This can't be good. Was this part of the plan? What can I do? What can I do? I'll keep the 8K200 back. Wise, get us out of here. Got it. Okay, what do I need to do? We don't have a lot of time. Cyborg popped into the computer and is looking for you. Pay attention to the screen and let me know when you see a green light. There! Anytime, wise! Jessica! Let's go! Laser! Close it! Click! Here, it's Superman. The name makes more sense now. You didn't happen to bring an antidote with you. I'm sorry. We don't even know what the antidote would be. We have to figure out who's changing the Grim and how. Who in your world can do that? Salem, Dr. Merlot. Why? Where? What? Here's... We're different here. My aura. I don't feel it. I bet there's a bunch of new things we can do here. But we've had years of training with our summons and weapons to fight Grim. With them gone, you want us to fight with... What? Our good looks? I think we can scrounge up a few tools that might help you out. A massive Grim attack! What is that? They made a new Grim. All of justice? Come in, all of justice! We're here, Vixen. Canary and I are headed to Central City. Just got reports of more Grim attacks there. But Batman should know about Gotham. No. He needs sleep. Let's check in with everyone else. Fire's taken care of Brazil. Titans are dealing with San Francisco. Arrow's dead. Titans are dealing with San Francisco. Arrow's got Star City. This is more than the last few attacks. The Grim have... I don't know. Evolved. How so? They're sort of... ...powered to fight us. Whatever Grim attacks Canary knows to evade her cry and grows tentacles to silence her. I can shift to our weaknesses. We need to figure out who could do all of this and fast. We'll split up and meet you. Hurry. I don't know how much more Canary and I can take on.
