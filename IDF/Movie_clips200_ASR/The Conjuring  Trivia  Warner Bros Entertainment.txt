A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A So the doll was never possessed. No, no. It was used as a conduit. It was moved around to give the impression of possession. Demonic spirits don't possess things. They possess people. When you hear it, you're going to think we're insane. Try us. Please. From the start. It started out small. Like a hand or a leg was in a different position. And its head was looking up instead of down. And then one day it was in a completely different room. It was moving around by itself. No Three No Feet anymore. You guys don't want to beat her. I don't want it going away. Spensive feeding you girl. Seven Eight Nine Ten Well you're not here I clapped. Okay clap. Second clap. So all these are taken from cases you investigate. That's right. Everything you see in here is either haunted. Curse there has been used in some kind of ritualistic practice. Nothing's a toy. Not even the toy monkey. Don't touch it. Oh. Isn't it scary? Or doesn't it worry you to have all these items right in your home? That's why we have a priest who comes by once a month to bless the room. Well the way I see it is. It's safer for these things to be in here than out there. It's kind of like keeping guns off the street. Look why not just throw them in an incinerator. Destroy. Well I would only destroy the vessel. Sometimes it's better to keep the genie in the bottle.

Now you're done.ẫon And like that, an upside down cross started to appear from within his body. Alright, sure you can hit the lights. Did you personally perform the exorcism? No, I'm not authorized, but I've assisted on many. So your exorcism can be very dangerous, not only for the victim, but for anyone in the room. You know, it's a damn mistake, but we also get all kinds of birds that will just fly against the side of the house and break their necks. Really? And the clock stopped at 307 am. All of them? Everyone. Oh, we were hanging those along the stairs. Something just kept knocking them down, so we stopped hanging them up. And they're... At course they are. ...so they can fall into their powers. They are, they're evil, they're 조심ed. Over here! They're everyone else in there. Sir! We're hearing all the voice. Here, listen. Follow me. This way. This way, I hide. Ready? Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Do you hear me? She won't let her hear the house. If we take her out, the witch will kill her. Roger!
