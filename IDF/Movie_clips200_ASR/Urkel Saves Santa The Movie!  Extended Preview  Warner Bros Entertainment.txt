 This is a good place to sleep. I'll be back soon. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. The holiday season is here! I've been meeting the perfect sweater for ugly sweater day. Just so you know, I don't think you're ugly. I can spink forever in your arms. You're an itchy, squishy, scratchy, wool-arbs. So nice. Thanks, Erkobat. Now that it's officially the holiday season, this room feels so November. But this is the perfect time for me to try out my newest invention. Steve Erkobat Industries presents that December riser. With a simple flip of a switch, the holidays are at your fingertips. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oh no. I think the pile... How's it going? Oh, right, right. Oh, right. Oh, right. Oh, right. Oh, right. Oh, right. Oh, right. Oh, right. Oh, right. I will December. It's my favorite month of the year. From the first to the 31st. I celebrate all that good cheer. I love December. I don't mean other months are not great. I don't want them to feel away. But it's not a party, babe. Steve, keep it down. I can't keep it down, my postal pal. Do you know that I've been waiting 334 days for it to be December again? And now that it's here, I can't waste a minute of it. I love putting up a Christmas tree and hanging up on it. But I also love the ones I fixed. Lost in corn out of my pee. I love celebrating Hanukkah. Sometimes I get too light to my heart. I love snowball fights with my snow. But Arnie, this year I'm coming for you. There's so many great days in December. It's hard to pick my favorite. So I celebrate them one and all so I can really savour it. It's just like a documentary for pants. Everyone for themselves. No, Mr. Kalen. It's just Steve Arco. Ah, all right. It's December. Oh, I love December. It's the number one gathering of days. It starts on the 330th. I'll turn it in. We think 136 on a leap year. A lot of people use a lunar calendar. What? I'm just trying to be inclusive. I love December. It's the best month of a bunch. There's no fighting on boxing day. But there still might be some punch. Last post-cada says 9 nights of worship. I'm so cosy day of clinging pain. With the best of us for the rest of us. Ooh. There's something for everyone. Steve! All this singing is for you. Steve! All this singing and dancing is going away. Everybody up! Everybody up! Everybody up! Everybody up! Well, not to quibble, but technically you're being a lot better than me right now. The holidays have traditions. They shouldn't be forgotten. To not respect them at all. Would really be quite rotten. It's not just about presents and toys. These holidays have meetings. They bring families together. Despite their political leanings. This season isn't just a day. We take our rain across the street. We must never forget December's when we celebrate the baby. Jamie! Sanchez Harrier's in the building. Home! I love December. We break month of the year. From that first to that thirty first. I celebrate all that good cheer. Steve loves his suffering. He celebrates every holiday. But this one always feels the way. Because I'm on a Saturday. Oh, good! You're up! Happy holidays, Mrs. Paxen. I'm looking forward to your egg-naught cookies this year. I don't skimp on the cinnamon. Happy early Hanukkah, Mr. Kaling? That's not a thing! It's just Hanukkah. And it hasn't started yet. But that doesn't mean you can't get a head start on celebrating. Anybody need help getting holiday lights out of a must-steed basement? Coaching out my family? I'm looking at you. Steve, dear. What we need is sleep. But I let you sleep in this year. Sure. Compared to last year. When you woke us up at midnight. I just want this holiday season to be the best it can be. And that means we can't waste a minute of it. As one of Santa's helpers. Steve! One of Santa's unofficial helpers. I want everything to be perfect for the big egg when he arrives. It's my job. Not your job. To make sure there's enough good cheer spread into every looking cranny of this month. It's not an English muffin, kid. It's a month where we buy more candles and wrapping paper than usual. Oh, I beg to differ, Mr. K. Smell the air. Oh, you smell the same too. Smells the same to me. Like snow and pumped-and-spiced garbage. You can't get that in July. Which is why Santa doesn't show up in the summer. He shows up in December because Santa's drawn to the lumens of string lights. The pollen of mistletoe. The uvori of giving gifts and higher cat's interest is a goodwill! I always assumed it was the Christmas Carol's. Those two. Now who wants to head to the mall for a little Mala Day window shopping? Steve, how can I put this delicately? Now! What he said. Well, that was not the answer I expected. Here's a thought. You all rest up. Dream some holiday themed dreams. And when I get back, I'll be going door to door to test and uncangle everyone's holiday lights. These holidays aren't going to celebrate themselves. This package needs a signature. I know you're in there, Mrs. Paxen. Go get him, guard up on him. You can shoot. Come out. Come out. Steve, wait up. Hey, thanks for fixing up the court, man. It's amazing. Yeah, no sweat, Jordan. Well, except for the sweat on the court. I'm glad that my microwave powered climate controlled concrete is ahead. Microwave power. Wait, wait, wait. Is he going to stun our growth or anything? Not at all. My Erkkel Industries patent pending climate creek is perfectly safe. If anything, it might make you grow a few inches. Really? No. You're probably never going to get taller than 5 foot 10. Just basing that on your general bone density and family history. Sorry. Now horse on the other hand. Woo. You might hit seven feet. Hey, you should take your jacket off and stay a while. As much as I'd love to impress you with this killer crossover, I've got to head to the mall. It's a big day. They're lighting up a giant Christmas tree. What? They like plug it in? Yes. Over 2,000 twinkling lights and shiny ornaments. I like to oversee the springing of the garlic. Make sure the popcorn to cranberry ratio isn't off. Do you get paid to do that? No. It's sort of a volunteer position I created. It's tough and tasty work, but someone has to do it. The city's got to be perfect for when the big guy arrives on his slate. Oops. I almost walked up with the rock. Hey, horse, Nolapans. BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! What? What? What? Steve, what you do? You're always saying how you want to make it rain buckets on the court, so there you go. I built a rain machine. Although I don't know why you'd want to play be ball in the rain. It seems slippery. But I guess that's how the splash brothers got started. Did you know the splash brothers are not really brothers? Oh, no. Is that? So it's the holiday boy. Nope. Not today. He can catch the next bus. Huh. Huh. This is some roll with this bus. Ah! Here! Let me help you. Let me help you. I'm on a schedule here. I need you all to... Thanks for riding the metro. You old weirdo. It's okay. Happy holidays, Sheryl the Bus driver? Oh, holiday boy. Take me to the Twin Burns Mall and step on it. And by step on it, I mean, try safely and make all of your scheduled stops. Ugh. And we're on our way.
