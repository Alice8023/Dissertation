 Don't stand with your back to the door. Many times do we have to tell you. Tell us you buy your footsteps, Gernie Helle. Someone might imitate my stride. I know the difference. I'll leave the New Weapons master. Don't deny to help on. Must make do as best I can. Choose your blade. If that quite a day, Gernie, this is song instead. That's rude. Come on. Come on. Old man. The slow blade penetrates the shield. I guess I'm not in the mood today. Move. What's mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises. No matter the mood. Now fight. Come on. I have you. I will look down, my lord. You to join me in death. I see you found the mood. Ah. Will it be that bad? You don't get it, do you? You don't really understand the grave nature of what's happening to us. For 80 years, Iraqis belong to House Harkinon. 80 years of owning the spice fields. Can you imagine the wealth? Your eyes, I need to see it in your eyes. You never met Harkinon before I have. They're not human, they're brutal. You have to be ready.
