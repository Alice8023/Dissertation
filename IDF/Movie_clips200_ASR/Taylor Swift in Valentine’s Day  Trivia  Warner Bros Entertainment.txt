 The day was a fairy tale, you got a smile, takes me to another planet. Every move you make, everything you say is right. Today was a fairy tale. So how do you two feel about each other this Valentine's Day? Oh my gosh, I totally love him. I'm crazy about her. More here, KVLH, channel 13 right here at the downtown flower mart with Mr. Simon FAM. That's Ph.A.M. not with an F. Mr. FAM. How many red roses do you sell on Valentine's Day? The Captain of the near one married on Valentine's Day. What's that you said? The Captain of the near one married on Valentine's Day. What's he talking about? 110 million red roses are sold in America every Valentine's Day. 60% of those are produced here in California. Does he work for you? I mean, I'm a florist. So my boyfriend texted me this morning and he was like, look outside your door. But you know, I look outside my door and my boyfriend's nowhere to be found. But there's like this giant white bear on the ground. Oh, he's a cat. A florist. Yeah. Isn't that like the sweetest thing ever? Ever and ever. Do you like your gift? I didn't open it yet. You need to open it. Wow, it's my fracture. Yeah, but I earned on your lucky number on the back. 13. But that's your lucky number. You don't even like it. No, no. I love it. I can't wait to wear it. I can't wait to wear it. What are you doing tonight, Calvin? I'm actually here about the Sean Jackson interview, but we could talk. To lags, I'm not asking you out. I'm just curious, how are you spending this happiest of all days? No, let me just... You sure you don't want to call somebody? I just want to know if, in fact, I am the only person on the whole freaking planet who is completely and 100% alone on Valentine's Day. Is your question? Yeah, I'm working. I got three telecasts, 9, 10, and 11 o'clock. Usually I do two, but people want it off, so I'm happy to come perform on this day. You don't like to go out on Valentine's Day? I hate it. Me too. This is my fault. I'm alone. Why do you hate heart shaped candy? I think it because it reminds me that this is Valentine's Day, and I'm recently single. Well, we just... we weren't on the same page. It's okay. It's over. Nothing to be done? No, no. I've seen the enemy and the enemy is me. Well, you could go for this duor, as she seems to like you. I think she likes everybody. That's her job. She looks over here every five seconds. No. Ready? Five. You want to bet on it? Three. I'll bet you a bag of pencils. Okay. Five, four, three, two. Oh, there it is. Okay, but I heard that was a coincidence. Five. Four, three. Oh, the book on three. She's going to come over here. Excuse me. Can you get me a bag of pencils, please? Good evening. Hi. You have some? Are you okay? Excuse me. You okay? Sir? Wait. Well, my name is Julian. I'm going to be your server tonight. Why don't I get started with a few specials? Yes, please. Tonight, the chef is featuring a dish that he likes to call the line stinking pig. You're kidding. How is that good? He starts by cutting off the pig's testicles and he chops them up really finely. He need tiny pieces. And then he takes those testicles and he pulverizes them and adds in a little... A regular ssamsage, a fettiches and shoves the mixture back up. Oh, we're going to lick you all up and down. Scratchy little tongues going up and down. Oh, oh. Oh, Stanley, I'm going to have to have a mint juu lift to cool down after that one. Talk to you next time. Thank you. Oh, God. That is a really unusual way to talk to your boss. It's not what you think. Really? Oh, awesome. Because what I think it is is you leaving me a dinner to talk dirty to your boyfriend Stanley. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What a relief to know that you're not someone who licks people all up and down with their scratchy kitty cat tongue. I'm Moonlight as an adult phone entertainer. Like, phone sex? Yes. This is the busiest day of the year for phone sex. Surprise. Where are you? I'm here. I'm coming. Oh, sorry. I said, hey, my love, I want to listen to me. I know I let you down and maybe you don't think I deserve your forgiveness. But you're going to give it to me anyway. You're because when you love someone you love all of them, that's the job. I know that now. I'm so sorry. And now, please, you've got to love everything about them. Not just the good things, but the bad things too, the things that you find livable and the things that you don't find livable. I understand. I'll never leave you. So, how did you guys meet? It's really funny, actually. I was not into him at first. He used to shoot spit wads at me in Spanish class, which is so junior high. But then one night I was brushing up my hair when I got home, and I found this spit wad. But it was really a note. And it said, what's up? And I was like, that is so cute. And then I liked it. And then I got this spit wad. And then I got this spit wad. And then I got this spit wad. And then I got this spit wad. And then I got this spit wad. And then I got this spit wad. And then I got this spit wad. And then I got this spit wad. And then I got this spit wad. And then I got this spit wad. And then I got this spit wad. And then I got this spit wad.
