 This is for Happy RoodeTT. Wolf Woo,dale. I lean forward about four times a day, that often happens in a good place. All right, parent. Now, look who's here. eight-year-long clock. Eight-year-long clock. Eight-year-keys. Your keys, grandmother died, and they need a personal day. Oh, is none of those things? What was it this time, Barry? It was something else that was far less outlandish. And I know I missed the meeting, but I'd still really like to present these case files for potential review. I think we rushed these cases. We need to re-overnest. We got a backlog six months deep, and you want us to move slower? You need to focus your motion. Do the work. Close the case. Move on. You have a lot of potential, Barry. You shouldn't still be getting coffee after all these years. You're right. That's true. Go give me a coffee. Do you check or so, yeah? Yeah. You're going to love this. The ruling in the Johnson case, the evidence our lab analyzed was more than sufficient to be conclusive, still working that evidence. Intelligence, hard work and focus. Barry was still working on that evidence. I think if we're up to you, we'd still be scraping ten bunnies molars. You know what? I'm so happy you find this also hilarious, but we are dealing with real people's lives, people's families, and I don't think you can grasp the gravity of that. So why don't you leave me alone? Barry Allen? I was asked. You know my full name also. Yes, from school. Barry didn't tell us you had a friend from school. We actually didn't know that Barry had a friend. Yeah, what are they making now? One? One. You guys. Bye, you guys. Okay, oh my God. They're not really my friends. They're my work friends. Do you work here? Yes, I do. God, it's been a long time, huh? Hmm. I feel like we saw each other, like a few years ago, right? No, because we haven't seen each other since college. Well, maybe I was just thinking about you. Well, I'm really glad I ran into you. Yeah. Yeah. Your father's a pillist tomorrow, right? Yeah. Sorry, how do you know about that? I'm covering it for the paper. Oh. How is Zee holding up? Are you asking for the paper? No, I'm asking as a friend. Oh. Although I'm sure the public would want to know as well. Well, my only official comment is that my dad is innocent. Right. I mean, no one would want to believe that their father killed their mother. What do you mean, believe? My dad shouldn't be in jail. My mom should be alive. It's not about what I believe. It's about what the truth is. Right. No, just. That's... Oh, my God. That's what I meant. Right. Sorry. I have no official comment at this time. You have any collect calls from the Iron Heights, Minotentry? Do you wish to accept? Yes. Hey, don't. Hey, how you doing? I'm fine. You getting out much? Yeah. No, no. No. I ran to an old college friend, Irish West today. Didn't you have a mind? I didn't know you were going to be here. I didn't know you were going to be here. I didn't know you were going to be here. You still feeling stressed today? Didn't you have a monster crush on her? Oh, shit, a weird friend. She asked you about it. Dad, I, on... I had a friend run the old security camera footage from the store through this new program he's developed. And it's crystal clear now. It's just... You never look up, Dad. You can't see your face. Without new evidence to support your Alibi, We're all about here. We're just gonna need to start thinking about the next. You know, not you need to stop worrying about your old man. You do that, you might actually have time for a girlfriend. Dad, I don't want. You've done this before. This was a last ditch effort and we'll go through the motions tomorrow. I'm okay, really. You know, sometimes I even think it's probably easier for me to be in here than out there without her. This is the way I can imagine she's alive. Out there living her life. Erry. Erry. You there? Yeah, I'm here that. I remember that sauce she'd make on Sundays. No house is an all-in basal tomatoes. She put all my sweats to start singing. Yeah, what was that song? I love that song. Remember that part. It's not fair. What's not fair, Mankie? This question is stupid. How many calculations can you think of with an answer of 24? There are a bajillion answers. How am I supposed to fit them all? You are right. There are a bajillion answers to this question. Not every problem has a solution. Sometimes you just have to let go. Give you a brain of rest and hold me and make the pasta. Come on. Oh no, I'm here that. Henry. What are you calling your meal? I need you to do me a favor. I don't need favors. Okay. Barry needs you to do me a favor. Oh, very. Yeah. Anything. I need another kind of tomatoes. You have a kind of tomatoes. I need another one. I'll touch you guys' one to store this morning. But I forgot to tell you this. This looks way more fun. Let's just let Barry go to the store. You drive right square. What? You're so big, you can do anything. Look at you. You're getting gray actually. We can love the blue one. Okay? Got it. Blue can. Not the green one, right? Yeah. What? Blue can. Not the blue one. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The baby is the baby. No, it's a baby. I'm sorry. Oh. Rangberry! The baby is the baby. Rangberry is the baby. The baby is the baby. The baby is the baby. Hey, hey, hey. I love you, Mickey. I love you, Mom. I love you first. . When very and Hey, Mary, don't worry about tomorrow. We always know it was a long shot. That? You're cold with iron heights.

I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
