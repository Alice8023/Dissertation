 Welcome to Selena's kitchen. Whoo! Oh! I have a question for the both of you. Would you ever do a competition, like a culinary celebrity? Absolutely not. A lot of people use their knives to smash it, but I feel like that's a little dangerous. So I like to use the bottom of the jar, and I just like press down. Oh! Oh my gosh! Oh! Oh, she shed on the head. We're going to break down this plantain. How many do we need? I would just say two. Oh, good. You did a good job cutting. See when there's like no technique that you actually kill it. That's a great compliment. Good job. There you go. You're doing it. Perfect. You can cut them in half. That's great. Oh! It's looking good. Now we'll chase that, see if it needs more salt. All right, this is pretty damn good. Whoop! Whoa! Yeah, careful because it's very heavy. Yeah, is it on? Perfect. See? That didn't work. See, it fell off. Sorry. Let's look at our vegetables in the oven, shall we? They should be nice and sharp. I'm going to show you what mine looks like. So sorry, the alarm's going off. Oh no! Where is it? It just gets better by the minute. Whoa! I think they're looking good. Listen to them, main thing. Okay, here we go. Honestly, that looks incredible. It looks better than mine. I just have to say KFC Whoop. KFC Whoop! Let's blend this. Oh. That looks good. Perfect. Okay, let's grab two large bowls. Whoa! Okay, let's grab two. Oh, wow! Are you okay? Cut the top off first. Boom. And then we're going to take the bottom off. That's it. Got it. Then you're just going to make a slit in it. Got it. Yes! Then you're going to take your knife and just roll it. And it's going to remove this inside like a profession now. Like a profession now. Look at that! Let's take the roasted tomatillos. Simply add that to our blender. Yay! I like what really want one episode for her to forget to put the lid on the blender. Oh, right now it's about to happen. Damn it! We're going to have so much fun. Yay! Look, I'm getting an A plus. You are. We got through the fan. We got it! Yay!
