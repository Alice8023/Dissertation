 After seven years, a lot of the work itself kind of blends into one and what you remember are the people and the connections and the crew and the cast and I think that stuff is what I really hold on to. That's the fair point. Things are being wrapped up and when I watch the episodes, I catch myself getting emotional. I'm like, can it do? This is the last time that these characters are in the same scene together. I guess it's happening. It feels bittersweet. There's a part of you that is very excited to see what happens next and there's a part of you that feels really nostalgic and kind of somber that it's ending. This set has been my home. My God, I don't want to cry. Oof, I'm emotional today. Would be weird to not feel emotional saying goodbye to a character and an experience in this world that we've all been in for such a large part of our lives and it's going to be really weird to not come to this set every day. I'll never get to experience anything like this every again. These dresses make it really hard to cry. Archie Andrews, may I have the stance? To all the fans that have supported us and you know especially the fans who have been there from day one, I want to thank you so much for making this all possible. I am forever grateful for the fans who have supported me personally as an actor but then also who have loved Betty and all of her flaws and all. We wouldn't be where we are without you and Cheryl certainly wouldn't be where she is without you. So thank you. Don't be sad that it's over. Be happy that it happened. Wow, we thank you. It's been a long time and we love you. To the future.
