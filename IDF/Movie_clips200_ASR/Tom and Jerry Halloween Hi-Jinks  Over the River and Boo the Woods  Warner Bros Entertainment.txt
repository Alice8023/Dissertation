 Lemme, soya! She's cute, we're going slow! Nope, you come over right here! So we got a pair of newcomers to the case of Barley. Finally, some entertainment. Yeah, I got Batwings. And it ain't polite to stare. That's just the way things work around here. Oh boy, I guess I gotta explain. You see, this is a cursed forest and I'm sort of a bat now. Listen, I don't make the rules. I just follow them. And here's the main one. Anytime somebody enters the forest, at least one sucker has got to stay behind. But because there's two of you, only one has got to stay forever. Yeah, that forever bit always gets him. Hey, wait a minute. If I get out of here, Christ, I can bleed. Oh, hello. You ain't supposed to hear that. Long second! Nuts! Exploding nuts! Yo, I ain't seen that last update! Like I said, one of my sins got to stay behind. The waterfall. That's how to get out of here. Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say hour? I meant my. See ya! Ah! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Yeah, hoo! I'm the first one out! Hey, no wings! Wait a minute. If I ain't got wings, I can't fly! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
