 Christmas is the greatest day in the whole white world! Do you really think so? Yes! Well, you're coming? What are you waiting for? DAAAAAAA! Does someone need a hug? I think you better dance. We're gonna rock this game! That's who! That's me! That's where you spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear. Don't push me because I am close to the edge. Christmas is such a wonderful, beautiful time. It's a time for friends and family. And then Santa comes and leaves presents under our Christmas tree. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, boy. I believe... One, three! One, two, three! Christmas! Oh! Christmas! Do not try that at home, kids. Do not try that at home. What you doing with your feet? This is the over-express! You sit on a throne of lies. Ho ho ho! Oh! Hello! I think this is the best Christmas I ever had.
