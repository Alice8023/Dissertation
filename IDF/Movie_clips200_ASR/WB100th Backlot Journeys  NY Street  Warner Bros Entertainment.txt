 On the Warner Brothers Backlot, New York Street has been making movie history since the movies were young. The street where Little Caesar breathed his last. Here's this, the handle of Breco. Is the street where Chandler joined Joey for his world premiere? This is so exciting, so glamorous, people taking our picture. Would you mind crouching down a little bit so that I look taller? There you go. The street where Norman Maine took Esther Blanchett to the movies. We're in luck, Esther. We're in luck. Why did the theater burn down? Is the street where Sheldon, Leonard, Howard and Kuthropali stole a movie? Why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one? The street where the public enemy avenged the death of his brother. Is the street where Dr. Ross faced the consequences of his good intentions? You don't need anybody else. You are a country unto yourself. Sorry. Were the Griswolds asked the wrong people for directions? I wonder if you could tell me to get back on the expressway. Thank you very much. Is where Batman and Robin took their Baton Biel for a spin? And where Martin Riggs got some good advice from his partner, Roger Murtaugh. Hold on, hold on, I got you. Hold on here. I got you. Hey, don't move. Over the years, New York Street has been transformed into feudal Japan of the 1870s. And a dystopian future Los Angeles where Deckard retired Zora's career as a replicant. Move! Get out of the way! It all happened on New York Street.
