 I Ain't no ocean ain't no sea My key Dada keep my sister waiting me My key Oh No No No No No No No No No No No No A smile That I still long Hoppa being loved with a girl course of fear No need to think I'm a let my boy, man You just cause you in the family way Just don't make me wait too long, Hoppa For my life I had to fight I never thought I had to fight in my own house Would you like to walk to me? See my name? Hell, no I know something's coming Sister You've been on my mind He beat me when you ain't here Cause her knee deserves me He beat me for nothing You're in my You're poor, you're ugly, you're nothing at all Yeah Us saying and dance and hollum Just trying to be loved Everything you done to me I've already done with you Baby, God I'm dead You're Sunday Oh, you can't sleep at night You think this is God off of you Walked by the color purple In a field Don't notice it
