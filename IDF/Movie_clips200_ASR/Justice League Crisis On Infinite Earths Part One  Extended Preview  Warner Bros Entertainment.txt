 the Oh, it's the last. It's the last. It's the beginning. He said before the beginning, huh? Who's there? My lab. Something happened. Oh, I'm so hungry. Let's see. I'll have the... The sausage and peas, french fries, white toast, apple pie, and coffee. You ordered a while ago, and I wasn't about to forget that culinary curiosity. Iris. That's what the name badge says. Here you go. Oh, Iris. What? What? What just happened? What was supposed to happen here? We met. I've been working too hard. Hey, no, you should sit down. Is this okay? I don't want to get you fired. Doesn't matter. Today's my last day. I've just been picking up shifts here till my ship came in. Where are you going? I landed my dream job. GBS News. You're a reporter. News writer. For now, but maybe someday, who knows? Oh, you'll make it. I'm sure of it. I'm Barry Allen, by the way. Look, this may sound crazy, but... Would you like to go out for lunch? Barry Allen. You're already out to lunch. Well, we could split this. Flash. Flash. Get home. Get home. Get up! You need to get up. Get up! Please! You can do it. Get up! Flash! Get up! Please, don't do this. You want program to harm. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up! Get up! Flash. I'm the flash. Superman. Looks like that last blast, round on your cage a bit. You better sit this one out. I can handle this.

Somehow drained my power. Like Parasite. Yeah, me too. But I think you got the worst of it. Oh, no. Help me over there. I'll just... I hope it's not your birthday, pal, because you couldn't blow out a candle. I'll draw him away. Flash, no. He drained the energy out of me. If he gets yours, don't worry. I'll keep my distance. You all right? Well, I got some speed left, but not enough for, you know, a tornado or anything. You better get out of here. I'm not leaving you here. Come on! That won't slow him down for long. Whoa, I know you. Robinhood. Not Robinhood. You're dressed like him. Robinhood doesn't have a car. He needs medical attention. Starlabs, maybe. Oh, no, Starlabs. Yeah, I think they're a little bit too alien-disexionating. Where else? I have a friend. Are you sure this is a good idea? Well, it is Halloween. It's for you, sir. Trick or treat? Bruce Wayne? I thought this address was familiar, but... Hello, Ollie. And you're Barry Allen, a forensic scientist from Central City. Wow. How did you... We have a friend of yours. He gave us your address. Bring him inside. Where's your husband? Where's your husband? Oh. The flowers. What kind of flowers should we have at the reception? Irosis. We had irises on every table. We'll have. I mean, it would look nice if we have irises on every table. You were time-tripping again. Quality time is my love language, and here you were in another era. No, I wasn't. Yeah, I was. Just before the justice league formed. You know, there are other ways to help people without risking your life all the time. Why don't you help him? Here. Hey, mister. Here. Why don't you get yourself something to eat? The world's... unending. Really? Which ones? All of them. Ah, I'm coming. Hello? Mary? Oh, Bruce. I heard the recognize you. I'm so used to seeing you with all the stuff on. Come in. Hey, sport. What's your name? Dick? I'm Barry. Can I get you guys anything to drink? Some grape soda or... Iros left something called kombucha. Maybe it's tea? No, thanks. I'm good. You know, my nephew Wally's about your age. He's playing video games down in the basement. Introduce yourself. Can I? He just lost both his parents. Circus accident outside Gotham. Not really an accident. Oh, I heard about that. Poor kid. You have connections with the Central City Orphanage. Yeah, I volunteer there. Why? I can't put him in the system in Gotham. Social services there is not optimum. I see. Bruce, have you thought this out? Yes, that's what I do. Right. Look. I may be way out of line here, but he seems comfortable with you. You have means, plenty of room. Have you considered maybe what? Fostering him. It's too dangerous. You know what my life is like.
