 House Harkanan For centuries, House Harkanan was a house minor, not possessing the ruling power required to be considered amongst the great houses. Yet even as a house minor, they were afforded a vote in the Landsrud Council, and over time House Harkanan was able to increase its influence by maintaining a stronghold over the well-firm market. The labour practices of House Harkanan have long been called into question, accused of unethical behaviour in the service of maximising production while minimising cost, over time their wealth only increased. Their home planet, Yeti Prime, also suffered under the industrial ambitions of House Harkanan as resources were depleted and the atmosphere damaged to the point of slowing photosynthetic processes, planet wide. In the year 101010 AG, House Harkanan was finally granted a fiefdom on the desert planet called June, elevating them to a house major. By Heracus, House Harkanan was tasked with mining the spice, which they did to great effect, sacrificing the well-being of the native fremen people to increase profit and production. For years, they controlled the precious resource of spice under the command of the tyrannical Baron Harkanan, bolstered by his nephew, known as the Beast, for his violent ways. The Baron ruled mercilessly, but in the year 10191, House of Traides was sent take over. The Harkanan did not embrace the transition and the two houses remain in conflict even today.
