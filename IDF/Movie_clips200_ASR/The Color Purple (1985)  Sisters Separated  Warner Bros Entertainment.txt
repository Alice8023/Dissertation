 Khaled Demoraśa Da l Shah Da lال I gotta go to school. I gotta go to school. I've got to go to school. What you do is no please, please please please no. No, no, no, no. Ahhhhh嗯... I'll get you... You are all so clever to come, that I had some money to my 50, I was going for it, and it was all really clever. So we split up. Don't say I had some money right up the conversation with you in the best way. The rest of you, let's do it for us, as much as you can. The devil is fucking right there. I wish I could marry his uncle one day! No! No! Oh... ...maybe... Oh Jesus... Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? You're the best I could give me from you. Why? Why? Why? Why? Don't go. See me? You and me as never part. My dear, dear, We ain't you, But as one part, My dear, dear, A emotion, A emotion, A emotion, A feeling of being down, A feeling of being down, A feeling of being down. Give up, my dear. Give up, my dear. Nothing but death can keep me from here. I hear it. I hear it. I hear it.
