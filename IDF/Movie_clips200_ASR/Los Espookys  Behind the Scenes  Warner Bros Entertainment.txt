 I love the idea of Goths and horror, but with the backdrop of Latin America. I'm Sean. Fred had an idea for a show about a group of friends that love horror. They're willing to make up a facts, prosthetics. They're into the illusion of it all. Is it important? I love horror. I and my friends are really real, so people can really really need it. The Spookies make horror experiences in a very broad abstract terms. We've been trying to find an illusion. How do we find it in a mirror? Like a mirror in a red light. Fred came to Polio and I to help develop it. Their style of writing is very imaginative, crazy and careful. We had a very clear idea of who everyone was. Both of our characters are so... Not grounded. Not grounded in reality. Where do you live in the world if you want to travel anywhere? Francisco Vani. Salud. And we wanted Ursula and Ronaldo to be very grounded and to feel real. Ronaldo ended up being so cheerful and so positive. As for our characters, I think that you knew you wanted to wear that little hat. From the beginning. From the beginning. From the beginning. When we were about to create this existence, we had it. I knew that I wanted blue hair. I knew that I wanted blue hair. I knew that I wanted blue hair. Tiko is a ballet parker in Los Angeles. Everything he's always wanted was to be in Marcaros. And he's supportive of the group. It's something else. It's something that's very important. It's very important. Theoretically, it's supposed to be kind of spooky and scary. But at the same time being about the optimism behind putting a group like this together.
