 You may now salute the brack. Have you got to come up again? Of course, so I'll say hey! Wife... Is my daughter falling asleep? I'm getting you, I'm seeing you. Come on now. I've been needing myself. I've been needing some, but they have time. They can't allow it. Don't you get out of this yard. Don't home somewhere. Come on down here. I need you to hold this baby. Let me see. I'll see you busy making a racket. Now, come on down here. Let that damsel feel. I come down while I get ready. I tell you the truth. It is.
