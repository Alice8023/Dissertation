 There's some Christians that need answering. I could do that. It began with the forging of the great rings. Three were given to the elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of men who above all else desire power. God knows. You're my biggest. God knows. Good to see you. I'm 111 years old who wouldn't leave it. You have aged there. In the common time it says one ring to rule the more. One ring to find them. One ring to bring them all. And in the darkness, bite them. This is the one ring forged by the dark lord Sauron in the fires of Muntdune, taken by Sillua from the hand of Sauron himself. The Doom of Man. It is a gift. A gift to the foes of Mordor. Why not use this ring? Long has my father, the steward of Gondor, kept the forces of Mordor at bay by the blood of our people. Are your lands kept safe? Shadowfacts. Is the lord of all horses. And has been my friends many dangers. To enter the forbidden bullpaste, the penalty of death. Shall I shoot? If I can't pull this male son, who's juicy sweet, I'll release the captain, fish and so juicy smooth. I am an entch. Tree herder. A shepherd of the forest. Don't come to it, Mary. Don't encourage it. Creebure, some call me. And who's sighted you on? Sight. I am on nobody's side. Because nobody is on my side. Little log. I can see him with my waking eyes. Then let us be rid of it. Once and for all. Come on, Mr. Frodo. I can't carry it for you. But I can't carry you. Come on! I can't carry it for you. But I can't carry you. Come on! How far is Minister's? Three days right. As the Narschool flies. And you better hope we don't have one of those on our tail. Here. Something for the road. Last of the long bottom leaf. I know you've ran out. You smoked too much, Pip. But we'll see each other soon. You have the gift of foresight. What did you see? I looked into your future and I saw death. But there is also life. And you're the only one who can't carry you. You have the gift of foresight. What did you see? I looked into your future and I saw death. But there is also life. You saw there was a child. You saw my son. That future is almost gone. But it is not lost. You have the gift of foresight. You have the gift of foresight. You have the gift of foresight. You have the gift of foresight. You have the gift of foresight. You have the gift of foresight.
