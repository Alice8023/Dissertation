 And they get to go to their jobs. We just stay home and God, that's supposed to be enough. You always want more. Oh. You do, candy. Whatever you have, you always want more. You're a candy. And I'm not going to apologize for it. It is human nature to go for something with a little thrill at the risk of falling. Oh. Are you okay? I'm fine. Are you sure? Would you be interested in having an affair? We can never allow Betty or Pat to get hurt. Never, ever. I would love to have you and Pat over. She wants me to go to the bathroom now. You need to be careful. Betty! Betty? Betty's dead. Oh my God. I say she was murdered with an axe. An axe. More than likely Betty Gore was murdered by someone she knew. Did you kill your life? No. I did have an affair with candy and want government. We all right? No, we're not. We're all right. You just chopped and chopped and chopped. I didn't do it. I think you did. You're wrong. This is the Texas. I hope to might be able to forgive murder. The adultery. Not too much. The jury needs to see you as human. And the truth has a way of coming out. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
