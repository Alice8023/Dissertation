 Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins. Brody! Brody! Oh my God! Here's a pretty thing, me thrilled, as light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scale. Let me see you put it on. My old ring. I should. Very much like to. Hold it again. Oh! I'm sorry. You must carry this burden. I would rather share one life. I would rather share one life. I would rather share one life time with you than face all the ages of this world alone. I choose a mortal life. The ring cannot stay here. This peril belongs to all middle earth. They must decide now how to end it. Bring forth the ring, Frodo. The ring is altogether evil. It is a gift. Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy. Let us use it against him. You cannot wield it. None of us can. The one ring answers the sorrow on alone. You have only one choice. The ring must be destroyed. What are we waiting for? It must be taken deep into Mordor and cast back into the fiery chasm from once it came. One of you must do this. One does not simply walk into Mordor. Not with 10,000 men could you do this. It is folly. The ring must be destroyed. And I suppose you think you're the one to do it. And if we fail, what then? I will be dead before I see the ring in the hands of an elf. Who said that is right? I will take it. I will take the ring to Mordor. Although I do not know the way. I will help you bear this burden. You have my sword and you have my bow. And my axe. No, we're coming too. Anyway, you need people of intelligence on the sort of mission. Quiz. Thank you. So be it. You shall be the fellowship of the ring. Great. So, where are we going?
