 Back in this saddle again back in this saddle. Oh my goodness almost 40 years since we were down in North Carolina filming Your version which I call our version of the color purple Celia feels like I Came to your office and Willard Pew was there who played Harp. Oh right you took a chance on me So feel so feel so feel so happy. That's gonna get married I'm wondering unknowns for most of the roles. I knew instantly that you were So fear instantly I said that the color purple was the most life-changing experience of my life and I loved it so much Color purple was different than anything in terms of the environment that we all collectively set up Yeah, it was different than anything I had done it was a first film for many of you and I would like to declare was my first real personal film I Felt like I was a newbie as you felt you were and what we thought she was I'll never forget watching Oprah and would be two powerhouse women, you know in a movie together Those actors in that film almost were like seeds that were planted and you get to watch them grow and become these things and They're their own fruit and they're their own trees and you know, I saw what would be goldberg And was like I think I want to be an actor. I can do that people still say they watch this Over the holidays when it comes on television. It has become a classic I remember the first time I watched it and I was really young and I didn't fully understand But I just knew that it made me feel something it reminded me of like the first time I heard the blues like I just felt this This pain, but there's so much beauty in the pain The color purple and its legacy means the world to me I mean when I talk to my grandmother about what this film means to her Her eyes light up. I think it's a tremendous legacy. I decided to actually be a part of this film because of the legacy of this story It's a part of culture. Who doesn't know sister? I mean everybody's gonna be waiting to hear that song Oh sister We're two of the kinds Always having it play somewhere like in the background. I Means a lot that something that means so much to our family generations. I can now be a part of I'm pretty proud of the movie very proud of the work that everybody did in the movie. I'm proud of my own work I'm proud that the movie at the time of its release was the most successful Movie with a all black cast in the history of movies. It was a box office hit 11 nominations right the color purple Oh, you got a fight scene you got it was trying Really hard to fulfill the dream that Alice Walker had One thing that people are not aware about is how much the themes Alice Walker's book Still to this day continue to be relevant The story is enduring because people are still oppressed, you know, and as long as we have these issues We will have room for stories like the color purple The color purple is everything you get to see Black women just come into their own and find their voice in a place where they felt voiceless There are a lot of people growing up now and finding their voices about their own abuse There is also in the world a tendency for people to want to be free and expressing who they actually care for The thing that I love is that it keeps the story of Black women alive not forgetting where we come from and how far we have to go but how far we've already come You told Hoppa to beat me I love Hoppa God knows I do But I kill him day before I let him ain't it but it beat me Oh my life I've had to fight We are hopeful that we can come together and be better and keep on loving and keep on having children and keep on Trying to move the needle and bend everything towards a bit more justice. It's the ultimate Deliverance story nobody came in on a white horse and swept Sealy into a sunset right she hold everything together the way the community surrounded her I felt that it was more relevant today than it even was in 85 Alice's story Almost Shakespearean in its timelessness that it will live forever Until you do right by me everything you think about is gonna cry Because we will always see Dimensions of people in our lives or ourselves in these remarkable characters It's a story of redemption is a story of rebuilding it's a story of Finding yourself With time any generation will be able to hear and to use the medicine It's a very strong medicine Another 10 years it's gonna be another group that's gonna show up You know finds the things that resonate with our world At that time and make it relevant again and I just hope That it will be with the same as similar confidence The weave kind of made this one ours and I think that that's what's always gonna make Alice's work special Revival is oh promise The essence of the message of this film the book the Broadway musical the original film is God get pissed if you don't notice the color purple You
