 Go for it, I'll be done! Go for it, I'll be done! Go for it, I'll be done! Go, Abby! Ah! Okay, now I really have a wedgie. Fred! Ah! Oh my god, hurry it up! This ghost keeps grabbing! Yeah! Please! Kingies? Fred. Come in, Fred. Fred! Can you hear me? Fred's your hair, Mouse. Shockingly, Daphne's been captured again. But it's okay. When the Luna Ghost rounds the corner with Daphne, Shaggy and Scooby will pop out of the barrel. Then you'll activate the conveyor belt, spilling the vat of oil on the floor. Just remember my plan. Like chill out, Scooby-Doo! Stop shaking! Hey! Rats you! Alright, it's me. Sorry! Everyone! Ah! Scooby-Doo! What are you doing, man? I like this all the time. What? I'm going to be rude. Like there's a ghost right behind me, isn't there? Ah! Ah! Go away! Go! Run! Run! Oh my God, I'm so alone! Run! Run! Fred! Run! I got it! Look out! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Sorry, Velma. I know, Fred. Where is the ghost? He's right behind this broad table! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! He's still after us, girl! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Daphne, are you okay? I'm so over this damsel and distress nonsense. Uh, where's your extra? Like I'm right here, Fred! Hey, school, that was fun. Let's grab another skateboard and like do it again, huh? Huh? Yeah! Huh? Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! You're looking good. All right, nice to see you. Thank you so much for seeing the factory. Damn, any comments for us? This is a victory for any celebrity who wants to make a quality, ecologically friendly action figure. Fred, what's the secret of your success? Teamwork. I do a tremendous amount of teamwork, and I always have a plan. Yeah, my plan. I knew from the beginning there was never a phantom. The Luna Ghost is in fact... Oh, man, smithers! The creepy janitor? Smithers want a revenge after you refuse to go out with him. How could you, Hamilis? I am a lover boy of George Clooney and Proportions. Fred, how is the ghost able to fly? I can answer that. Walk. These balloons fill with a highly potent helium synthesis, giving the Luna Ghost his weightless appearance. I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling. It's time you dumb, dumb! Now get you, Bellis! Run! I can't believe you took credit for my plan again. No, no, no. That goes pod me for an hour and a half. Death, look, it's not our fault you always get kidnapped. I do not always get kidnapped. I can't believe you'd say that to me. Oh, please, you come with your own ransom note. Hey, my glasses! Who's helpless now? I'm going to kill you, damn you! Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's he ask of? Hey, you guys, look. I know I'm just the dude that carries the bags, but it seems to me we all play an important part in this group. I mean, we're just like a big, delicious banana split. Fred, you're the big banana. Daphne, you're the pastrami and bubble gum flavored ice cream and Velma, you're the best. Daphne, you're the pastrami and bubble gum flavored ice cream and Velma, you're the sweet and sour mustard sauce that goes on top. That sounds pretty good, doesn't it? It's cool. You know what, Shaggy? You really put it in perspective for me. Thanks. I quit. No. No way! You can't quit. I was going to quit in like two seconds. And now everyone is going to totally think that I copied off the smart girl. I went out and waited a minute, waited a minute. Maybe I quit. I do? Yeah, I quit. I'm out of here. Good riddance. No, don't go. Come on, you guys, don't do this. Please don't go. Come on, come on. Do I quit? No, school. Friends don't quit. It looks like it's just you and me for a while, buddy, old pal. We're out now, raggy. I guess we'll all just do what we do best, school. Pasti dochipani left, unside. Pasti dochipani left, unside. I'm out of here. I'm out of here. I'm out of here. Oh, man. Talk about toasted. Man, the only thing I like better than an eggplant burger is a chocolate covered eggplant burger. We thought so. Yeah, it's just another beautiful day in paradise. I'm looking for Mr. Rodgers and Mr. Duh. Did it take days? It's probably just somebody else looking for us to solve some terrifying mystery. Nobody home. Quick, school. Grab the food, don't let your grandma. I hope you found Mr. Rodgers and Mr. Duh. I'm sorry, dude. Look. I love to help you out. You look like a really nice guy. It's just we're not detectives anymore. What do I want? I've been sent by my employer, Mr. Emil Monteverius, to invite you to his world-famous amusement park, Spooky Island. We don't go near any place with Spooky, haunted, forbidden, or creepy in the name. Well, hydrochloronic. Right. Or hydrochloronic, but that's for a whole different reason, man. You're looking for Monteverius, would like you to solve a mystery. You pay your fee of $10,000. Yeah, it's just materialism's not really our bag, man. You provide you with free airfare? No thanks. We're gonna board. No thanks. And all you can do. Well, well, well, well, all you can eat?
