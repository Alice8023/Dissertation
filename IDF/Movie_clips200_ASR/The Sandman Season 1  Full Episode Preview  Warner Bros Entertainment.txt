 We begin. In the waking world, which humanity insists on calling the real world. As if your dreams have now effect upon the choices you make. Your mortals go about your work. Your loves, your wars, as if your waking lives are all that matter. But there is another life which awaits you when you close your eyes. And enter my realm. For I am the king of dreamness. And light mass. When the waking world leaves you wanting and weary sleep brings you here to find freedom and adventure. To face your fears and fantasies in drool and nightmares that I create. And which I must control. Unless they consume and destroy you. That is my purpose and my function. All it was until I left my kingdom to pursue a rogue nightmare. My lord, you are coming back, aren't you? Why would I not return, Musya? I don't know. A presentiment. As powerful as you are here in your realm. Dreams rarely survive in the waking world. Nightmares on the other hand seem to thrive there. Wake up, sir. We're here. Forny rigged. We're ready. And must have dosed off. Good afternoon, lad. My name is Dr. John Hathaway. Of the Royal Museum. Are you here to see the maids? I have come to see Mr. Robert H. Burgess. Father likes to be called maids. I have to see Mr. Robert H. Burgess. Father likes to be called maids. I mean, Joshua. Hear the darkness. Hear the darkness. Hear the darkness. Hear the darkness. Hear the darkness. Hear the darkness. The maids will receive his guests and the study addicts. Yes, Mr. Hikes. Hear the darkness. If you come to join Father's Order, the Order of Ancient Mysteries.
