 bring the back Come on, fire! You gotta catch your name for this one. Look how legends call it, Roden, the Fire Demon. It's comforting. Guys, you remember that tropical storm where we lost Monster Zero? It's changing direction. And guess where it's headed now? That's not possible. No storm moves that fast. Unless it's not a storm. Oh man. We need time to finish the evacuation. Then you better hurry, because it's closing and fast. Seriously? It's not a coincidence that Monster Zero thing is headed here. It's reacting to Big Bird's cries. That means it's coming for food or fight or something. Something more intimate. What do you suggest?
