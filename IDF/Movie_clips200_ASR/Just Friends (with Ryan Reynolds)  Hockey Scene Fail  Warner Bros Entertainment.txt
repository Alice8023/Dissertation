 Hello! Jamie, hey. What's up? Listen, I'm never gonna believe this, but I can't get a flight out. I'm stuck here another day. Mom. I want to apologize for earlier. Let me make it up to you. Do you want to go ice skating? I thought you hated ice skating. I used to, but you know, I'm actually pretty damn cook now in the MVP in my league in fact. Come on. Be like old times. Hello, Joyce. Mom. I'm on the phone. Well, Chris, what are you doing over at Joyce's? No, Mom. I'm in a living room 10 feet away from you, and I'm on the phone. Oh, we know I was wondering. While I have you on the phone, what would you like for dinner? We have a choice between chicken, chalme, and our pot roast. Please. Mom! Mom! What is this peanut? Where are my ice skates? Oh, honey, I gave those away years ago. Are you serious? I need them. Well, honey, why would I keep them? You're never here besides you. You weren't terribly good at ice skating. Well, I'm good now. And I need my skates to show off my talents. Oh, honey, I'm sure you can rent a pair of... Besides, you don't have to show off for chameleon. Just... just... be yourself. Be yourself. Be yourself. Be yourself. Now come on, Mikey and I are making snow-wanging jokes. I don't want to be myself. My snow-covered collection. Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. I'm worth finding if you're ready. Oh, steep! I'm gonna have a little bit of a rental skate. You know what? I've heard it before. You know what? I've heard it before. I'm going figure skating. Here, let me help you. Okay, I can do it myself, okay? I'm good, I'm good now. Hey! What's up? So. So. How's the love life? Leam. Marty and I broke up a year ago. You know the jerk, huh? Another jerk, huh? I'm kidding. I'm just saying it dated a lot of jerks back in high school. What about you? You in love with anyone besides yourself? No. Ha-ha-ha-ha. I really just been dating. You know? Just trying to look for my soulmate. Anybody that did you know? Maybe she tried harder. Or... I could try this. Hey guys, it's Miss Palomino. Yay! Hi guys. I'm very, very impressed. Hi. But you know these kids? Yeah, I substance it to teach her a class. Hey, um, we're having a pickup game. We could do some more bodies. You guys play? You know, Chris is a great player, but he has rentals. A good skater can skate in anything. Yeah! Come in. Okay guys, keep it clean. Oh my god! You're a fucker! I'm sorry! Okay, it's just these damn little skis. It's fine. Just don't touch them in front of a children. I'm hot enough. Get a cherry. He hacked me! What a fight, Paul! Kidding? No! No! No! All right, I'll break it up, break it up. What is your problem? She's just a child. That's a girl. Okay, listen, we're getting creamed out. It's his fault. You suck, brander. I brand you stuff, sir. Okay. Now Chris is trying his best here. Sorry, Miss Palomino, but it's just terrible. Not terrible. So, sir! Maybe he's a colored day. Oh, I could do this! Oh, I could do this! Hey! I'm a really good skater, little girl! Watch! You might learn some! I'm taking this one. You! One! One! One! One! One! Don't worry, Chris. Chris, you're going to be fine. Well, it looks like I was in the right place at the right time, Miss. Palomino? Jamie Palomino. Dusty Dingleman? Yeah, actually, I go by Dusty Lina, but yeah. Daddy, me? Thanks for saving me. Yay, Dusty! You remember Chris Brander? Yeah! Oh, yeah. It seemed better days, I guess, huh, Palomino? Hey, I don't want to make this weird, but you're fucking incredible. So do you. Really glad you dropped in. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Sorry about that, buddy. Here we go. Late 20s, male Caucasian. Multiple lacerations on lower mannable and possible concussion. Transport and route over. So, Jamie, are you still living in town? Oh, yeah, I just moved back. Oh, really? What? Me, too. It's a small world. No kidding. Jeez, you know, I cannot get over how great you look. Oh, me? Look at you. Yeah, I guess my skin cleared up and I lost my stammer, and I still play a mean guitar. I'm actually only doing this part time until I can make it music. You know, Chris is in the music business, too. He probably helped me. Oh, hey, easy, Dirk Retsky. Oh, geez. You know, we should hang out. You know, have lunch sometime. Oh, okay. I would love to have lunch. Where can I give you my phone number? Just write it on this. Jamie Palomino. That's a monster! You have an aged of people. Oh! Eh. What do you know about Dusty, Gangline? You mean Dusty Lee? Yeah. Works in the building, drives ambulance wine. Check this out. So, that was day again. Another day, day. Yes. Anyway, we're having a great time. And Dusty shows her how to know her. And then Jamie gives him her know her. Hey, didn't Dusty have like a huge crush on Jamie? Yeah. You got some competition there, Chris. I mean, Dusty is a really nice guy. Yeah, our Jamie doesn't date nice guys. She puts in a friend's gun and then torches this shit out of her. I don't know. Jamie's come a long way since high school. I think she might be maturing. Sure. So that's why she went with Dusty. She wants a sensitive guy. More like the old me. Well, if she wants Mr. Rogers, then I'm going to show her the biggest f*** he's ever seen. Yeah. Okay, we're done. Now, you're going to need to wear this for the next few days. Until those stitches are ready to come out. Here you go. Huh? Just like your old earbook picture. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
