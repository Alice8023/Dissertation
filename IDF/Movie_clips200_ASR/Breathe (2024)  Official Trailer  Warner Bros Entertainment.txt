 I'll be back. There's still no Zaki. Time out to kill each other while I'm gone. Oxygen levels at 20%. Dead? Dead? Hello? Ma, we haven't seen a living thing in three years. The world can heal if we give it time. We just gotta keep adding. Come on! Hello? Oxygen supply at 50%. Who the hell are you? I know your husband was working on the O2 generator. A major replicate. If she could replicate Dad's invention, it could be onto something big, Ma. Her paraphralatration system is failing. We don't get back. 25 people will die, but I need to see that machine. And I will see it one way or the other. We gotta stop her. I can't mistake. I'm not your enemy. It's a cutout there. Think about your daughter and do the right thing. TWIT! How are you? I'm fine. Good night. Nice to get you. We're gonna stay together.
