 I'm just not sure if I'm cut out to be a politician, Dylan. I don't want to spend my time doing ceremonial things, opening shopping malls, giving medals to people I don't like. Pardoning a turkey? Sorry. Thanks, Givin. It's a big holiday back home. People celebrate by eating turkeys. But by tradition, one turkey always gets pardoned. It says much about your species that you have based an entire holiday on deciding not to give something for a change.
