 Come with me. All right. And you'll be in a world of pure imagination. It's a ruined cost. Take a look and you'll see into your imagination. Frankly, I rather doubt it. We'll begin with a spin traveling in the world of my creation. What we'll see will be five explanations. Does the five explanation? If you want to view paradise, simply look around and view it. Anything you want to do is want to change the world. There's nothing to it. Not that. There is no life. I know to compare with your imagination with me there. You'll be free if you truly wish to be.
