Woohoo!!! Wooooh!!!! Here we are folks on the red carpet at the grand opening of the Custonian's criminology museum. Tonight's premiere exhibit is a rousing look back at the exploits of mystery and corporators. And here they are! The bugs this crowd is going crazy over mystery age. Here you go girls. I got an ask-out. For each of you. He's a shaggy. He's a shaggy. He's a quake in all city shaggy. You know it. Come on, Skull. I consider it a privilege. You too look beautiful. We have to take good care of ourselves. Sorry. Sweet. We love you, Velma. I love her so much. We have a room with Coolsville's hottest detectives. Absolutely. Here you go. That's your word. Come on, everybody. Heather, Jasper Howe, at the grand opening of the new Coolsville's criminology museum, with our guests of honor, the master detectives of mystery and corporated. I love you. I love you. I love you. It's all your success. You still going to have time for all of us here in Little Old Coolsville? Of course, Little Old Coolsville can solve its problems without us. But we'll always be here to help. The people of Coolsville are the best in the world! Fred, can you tell us a little bit about your exhibit? Absolutely. Mystery is proud to donate the costumes of criminals we've unmasked in the past. Like the Black Knight Ghost. Ah, very first case. The 10,000 volt ghost. Ra. Skeleton men and even the dreaded tear-dactor ghosts. We've also donated the costumes of some of our more ridiculous foes. Like chickenstein. Don't know. Can we get a shot of you next to the Black Knight? Ridiculous. Obviously, she forgot that dude tried to poke us. Hi, come on. Remember what I told you? Never pick your nose in public. No, but that's good too. Remedies everything. Yes, image is everything. Could the whole city's watching? So we'll try to keep it right face. Huh. There are costumes. Whoa, all right. She's right, Scoob. How close they look. Oh, what do we fake? The tar monsters scared the locals of the city of Bishanthius away in order to take their treasure. But on the positive side, he'd pay for driveways for free. In that right, Bo. So. There's something about the way you look tonight. There's something about the way then. I can't take my eyes off you. There's something about the way. Oh, no! You're living some vine. Maybe it's the way there. I can't nervous when you're alone. Hi. Oh, um, dad, me. This is Patrick Weisley. He's the curator here at the museum. It's very nice to meet you, Patrick. I hope you'll be working closely with our Velma on this ever-expanding signal. Listen, I know that you're a glamorous, mysterious, jetset adventure preoccupied with international intrigue and all. Oh, yes. That's me. I know, but there's a symposium coming up on the syntactic reasoning in the criminal brain. I have always found a criminal's inclination to incorrectly use the interrogative pronoun in places of relative. Delightfully absurd. Me too. Really? Yeah. What's...so maybe you'd want to go together? What do you mean, like...like... Like a date? With me? Oh, I...no, I can't. Patrick? Oh. Ah, my mystery is my mistress. I must heal her sweet call. Okay, okay. What's happening? Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Patrick. Don't hit that again, Patrick. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. We need to come up with a plan. I think it's our plan. I can't see him nose. There's none identified for you. I'm taking it here. The curtains. We're on them. We're all home chickens. We're all home. We're all home chickens. We're all home chickens. We're all home chickens. We're all home chickens. Jackie, use the ropes to tie them. Just a cut. Just a gastoo. It's just a gastoo. We tied it. Let go. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Sorry. You have to see Jackie and Scoop. There you are. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Mystery Incorporated. Oh, boy. This is only the first run on the ladder of your demise.
