 I'm heading up north in through New Bray, up to Wyon. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys. For what? For cutting up a lady. Cut up her face. Cut her eyes out. Cut her ears out. And leave and cut her to her penis. Yeah! Step over the office and get the pole with it. A little bit more. I'm gonna go back to the office. I'm gonna go back to the office. I'm gonna go back to the office. Get the pole with it. A weapon? That's all they get after what they've done. But ain't fair. Nobody's gonna be good money for a cut up horse. Come to the thaw you bring in five ponies and you give more skinny hair. And you, you bring in two. Hey! She's your pony. I brunk for the lady to want my partner caught. She ain't got no face left. You're gonna give her a goddamn magey pony. Get out of our house! They're paying a thousand dollars to whatever son of a bitch killed the two boys and got up the lala. The words probably got all the way down to Texas but now. How about it? Well? This is Ned Logan. Ned's an awful good shot with a rifle. Just because we're going on this killing that building man and I'm gonna go back to being the way I was. It's the hell of a thing to kill under that. Take away all these guys. And I always ever gonna. No like firearms man. You would leave me a conversey of my enemies. I'm telling them the right no horse goes. Leave them to what? Oh they wouldn't want to come look at pork. You just kicked the shit out of the innocent mage. Innocent of what? No no. County's got to take responsibility. Oh I guess they had it coming. We all have it coming. We got one, Sheriff. Come across this son of a bitch on a roll. Head and sound. You want to tell me and Mr. Moshev here. Oh about your two villainous friends. We'll give Matt his share. Together. Ned he's dead. I thought you knew that. Nobody killed Ned. He didn't kill anyone. The bar of tea boys caught him. A little bit of kill them for what we did. Give me your scoffia. I didn't gonna kill you. You're the only friend I got. Just hold her around there. Just shot an armed man. He should have armed himself. He's gonna decorate his slune with my friend. You'd be way money out in the sari. I've killed one of the children. Kill just about everything your walks are crawled at one time or another. And I'm here to kill you, Bill.
