 Oh! What's all I'm about to sing? It's called Miss Celia's Blues. Because she scratches out my head when I was ailing. Oh! Sister, you've been on my mind. Oh, sister, where do you ever kind soul sister? I'm keeping my eyes on you. I bet you think I don't know nothing. But singing the blues, oh sister, have I got news for you? I hope you think that you're something too. Oh, Brooklyn, I've been up right along the road and I've seen a lot of suns going down. Oh, but trust me, no low life's gonna run me around. So let me tell you something sister. Remember your name, no twister. Go to Stee, you'll stop away my sister. We show we got a whole lot of time. So shake your hands, sister. Because her need to serve is feeling fine. Thank you.
