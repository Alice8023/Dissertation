 My life fades. A vision dims. All it remains are memories. I remember a time of chaos. Ruined dreams, this wasted land. But most of all, I remember the road warrior. The man we called Max. To understand who he was, you have to go back to another time. When the world was powered by the Black Fuel. And the desert sprouted great cities of pipe and steel. Gone now, swept away. For reasons long forgotten, two mighty warrior tribes went to war. And touched off a blaze which engulfed them all. Without fuel they were nothing. They'd built a house of straw, a thundering machine spotted and stopped. Their leaders taught and taught and taught. But nothing could stem the evidence. Their world crumbled. The cities exploded. The world wind of looting. A firestorm of fear. Men began to feed on men. On the roads it was a white line nightmare. Only those mobile enough to scavenge. Progl enough to pillage would survive. The gangs took over the highways. Ready to wage war for a tank of juice. And in this mill strong decay, ordinary men were battered and smashed. Men like Max, the warrior Max. In the roar of an ingenious, everything. That became a shell of a man. A burnt out, desolate man. A man haunted by the demons of his past. A man who wandered out into the wasteland. And it was here in this plighted place that he learned to live again. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed. A man who was killed.
