 On the Warner Brothers backlog, Midwest Street might be the most recognizable movie location in the history of movies. The street where George M. Cohan was born on the 4th of July, is the street where James Dean interrupted a World War I parade, and where James Dean turned himself in to the Police Juvenile Division. It was a place of appeal here or something. Midwest Street has embodied small town America hundreds of times, like when Lois and Clark joined the small hill Autumn Carnival. Let's make this a day to remember. He was here that Harold Hill warned the citizens of River City of the moral decay threatening their small town way of life. You are not aware of the caliber of disaster, indicated by the presence of a pool table in your community. And here are the Duke Brothers raised Hill on the streets of hazard. Midwest Street became small town Kingston Falls, which got some unexpected visitors. The street was a good place to banalize parking meters for Coolhan Luke. And a good place to renew one's faith for the Walten's. As you're enjoyed your sermon, Reverend, thank you, Mr. Walten. Historically, snowmen have had a rough time on Midwest Street. Whether you're Jack Frost or Roaring and Laura like Gilmore. Oh, no, that is just wrong. We're competing against the Michelangelo up snow. And we're earnest building snowmen. We shouldn't look at it anymore. Head's down. Stay focused. We can do this. Absolutely. Through hundreds of films, in countless episodes of television, Hollywood history is made on Midwest Street.
