Now exactly where was the Fiko material found? Back there in the corner. You'll know when you're near it. Excuse me. This was male, too. We just emancipated. Excuse me, sir. You don't have a telephone, could you bring it a gas bill? We just think proof that you live in the district. Excuse me. My name is Jaime Escalante, and I was supposed to teach computer science. We don't have computers. Mr. Escalante. We were supposed to get computers last year in the year before, and there's no funding for them again this year. Let's get out here. I'm with Kellor Take on the chairman of the map. Kellor take with the working together. It's an image. Don't seem to understand. I was supposed to teach computers. Go ahead. Where did that student? That's what he knew. What do you mean? I was waiting. I knew the new teacher, man. You the teacher? Please find the seat. Give me a great shot. Woo! Woo! The teacher is moving on to the thing. Will everyone please try to find the seats? For those of you that cannot find the seat, please stand against the wall. Hey, let's put our glasses in a circle and discuss their feelings. Bring this paper inside. One body to a desk. Can we talk about this, Dad? There's one to my side. If we discuss sex, I have to get sex for homework. Woo! And back everybody, please. You don't want to get too far, right? Let's move back. Get the seat. In general, in English? Sometimes. Do all of those who don't speak English, please, please, stand up. You guys, you finally... Please move forward. If you do not speak all of those who don't speak English, please, pass them to the front. This is for all the first row. Please stand up. Please move out. I was the first one here. I'll find you another seat, OK? Oh, no. Please, be careful. This is Math 1A. I don't need no Math. I've got to still calculate it with my dozen donuts. Best is exact change. No big deal. Quiet. Quiet. Ah! Ah! No! No! No! Pick the food right now! Everyone's back in the classroom! Help me, help me! Everyone's back in the classroom! Everyone's back in the classroom! The premature dog! Back in the classroom! That was the premature dog! The premature dog? I thought we were supposed to discuss something, but... All right, sit down. Stop talking. Sit down. They rigged the bell. That little one. Chucky. What's going on? Go. She's looking good, Joe. Hi, me. When you're coming aboard? I get seasick in the rain. I've seen my boy. Yeah, I saw him riding around here somewhere. Hey, listen, I hear your company's pushing Ho-Hog and two PCs. I don't work there anymore. Hi, Mr. Tinhai. Come on. Here's your thing. Well, why don't you come to me if you got laid off? We're paying kids right out of college, 30 Jesus star. I didn't get laid off, Joe. I want to teach. High school teacher. Well, good. That's great. This is your job. I don't want to have to tell you, huh? I was going to do a wide-eating house around home. You're not even breathing hard. You're hearing home so fast. I have a good night, Joe. Hey, I'm one of burger. Pull the french fries, all the onions, add the pickles. You're like Julian Tauber. What you got? It's an apple. How much? What do you mean? What you got? Huh? I'm good. Excuse me, my German accent. What you got? Missing 25%. What? Missing 25%. It's right. Missing 25%. Is a true intelligent people make better lovers? That's for sure. Hey, what you got? I got a corn. You owe me 100%. I'll see you in the people's course, you see? Everyone, please open your books. Chapter 2, page 26. Multiplication of fractions. And percentages. 25%, 50%, 75%. And 100%.
