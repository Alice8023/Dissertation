 Freddie up on the way. Oh man, look who's in a sass-roll manner. Oh man. Another creepy crib. How could we never investigate like, okay, I've seen yourself in a, uh-huh. Reggie. O-o-o-o-o-o. All right. Then again, creepy is my middle name. R-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r. R-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r. Scroo-ro! Oh, come on, Scroo-on, huh? Looks like a bit of a fixer, Rupper. Okay. Hey. Oh. Nice job last night. Wolfsars. Quick. We need to think of a comeback. What door? Hey. Shut up. Uh-huh. What is it? It's a good one. He. You are trespassing on Wiggles' manner. Leave now or pay the price. Kind of jerk makes that a store, pal. Dude, he just said we'd pay the price. Shaggy, shaggy, shaggy. What could possibly happen by ringing a doorbell? Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! That's what can happen by ringing a doorbell, Fred. What? At 7 p.m. the owner will be home to set you free. Oh. Hey. You want to buy a box of cookies? Excuse me. Have you heard the good news? Man, there's cookies! Oh! Hey, hey! What's your junk? Oh, brother. A box on a laser thumbprint scanner. Oh! Let me just get to my makeup. Dad, now? You know what, Velma? It's never too late to learn to properly apply makeup. Okay. The last good thumbprint should still be there. So, a little blush. A porcester? Hello? Oh, my dad. I enjoy being a girl. Come on, you. Come on, you. Come on, you. Come on, you. Come on, you. Come on, Fred. You're right. It's in the cookies. Welcome. Okay, gang. Let's like split up and search for clues. Let's go and I will go this way. Right, go. Okay. I stole my thing that I say. For Red for clues. Wow! Right, go. The glow is similar to the tarot-actyl scale. Oh, my poor little girl. Ah! Ah, clue! Well, it looks like Wiggles shares Zolt-Pow-Jacobo's fascination with the supernatural. He collects everything from Peary-Rice, Talistar Crowley. It's dust, too. Well, the dust is good. We can tell what he's been reading lately. My ear! What is it? It's an obsolete Celtic text used by secret societies in the mid-19th century. Look, the book belonged to Jay-Jacobo. The original tarot-actyl ghost. Maybe he'd give it to Wiggles before he died. Oh, my poor little girl. Oh, my poor little girl. Oh, my poor little girl. I like big slugs, and I cannot lie. Other brothers can't deny. I want to go. Can you read it? It's an amalgamation of magic and science. Here's a list of ingredients, and how to create your own carbon-based organic composite predators. This is an instruction manual on how to create monsters. Those are probably clues, Scoob. Those are just things you want. Like, why is it toy-the-brush a clue? Scoobie doobie doobie doobie doobie doobie doobie. Just because you can sing in a Scoob doesn't make it a clue. It just makes it awesome. Let's change the last scene. Scoobie doobie doobie doobie doobie. Hey, like what's this? Oh, the faux ghost. Hey, we're luck. It's tonight's Scoob. No, we are detectives. You found an actual clue. No, we're not. No, we're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. Don't shut down. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Let's go. Heavy stuff, Scoob. Hey, let's go. So good through this. We are smarter than more. Yeah, what a moron. No metalhead. Bring it. He brought it. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Hold him up. I'll look in the water. Maybe there's a formula for finding his weakness. What? Not here. Find his weakness. We can't find him. He doesn't have a position of the slots. I know, do you have a grasp? No, no. I have this point. 28 to have him. See that? This is bad. That's what this number is. No! I have this way. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! I have some crap 9,000 and 34. That's your life. Any time we'll be straight, Bob. I'm trying. Three, four. Three scores. Which makes his weakness point right here. Right in the round tables. Break your legs. Let's go, Reveal.
