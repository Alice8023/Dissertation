 Very hard directing Barbie on this beach. Hi Barbie! Hi Barbie! The beach sequences was one of the most difficult to kind of crack actually because we're in a place that has no water, so it's toy. And actually retrospectively it's like well of course it would be plastic and of course it would be solid. But you know arriving at exactly how that was going to be done was very tricky. There's no wind so the sand never ever boggings you. We've got signs that say swim with sharks and every day is a happy swimmer's day. I mean everything is perfect about Barbie Beach. Everything looks like sweets. So the mountains are painted like cook-a-truffles and the rock looks like raspberry marrants.
