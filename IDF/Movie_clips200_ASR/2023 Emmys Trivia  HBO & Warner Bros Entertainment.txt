You want to kick the student? Oh, I don't do that anymore. Because of therapy and anger management. Also, at a charter school. There's a lot less oversight in the hiring process. So it's been pretty sweet. Well, sweetheart, it's good to see you and the school is wonderful. Yeah. Are those my books? Oh, yeah. I've been kicking myself for losing them. It's not funny. Nope.

One that's sealed off and boarded off and no one's supposed to go in. Ever? That one? Whatever. I snuck in. I wanted to see what it was like. Didn't think there was going to be anything in there and then when it just came up to me, I didn't know where. But I got away, but... So it was just you in there alone? Yeah.

What am I doing? I'm set up to kill Paco like you asked me to. What do you mean? What am I doing? Oh, right. Here's the thing. I need you to wait, Barry. Just a little bit longer from my signal. Wait. What signal? Why? Because we sent bullet to the Bolivians. We sent a bullet to the Bolivians? What? Like in the mail? The HL. Paco is our informant within the Bolivians. We tell him, trust us. Tell us everything you know. He tell us. Because he is stupid. And now we have to kill him before he tell other people he tell us. Okay, what does it have to do with mailing a bullet? See this way, we send message to the Bolivians. Against either heads. They open mail, bullet, what? Phone rings. Hello? Paco's dead. What? Little at least a big what for full effect.
