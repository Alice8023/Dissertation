Your job will be to say the alphabet backwards within 18 seconds. You see that's why you have it in front of you man. It's not about memory. It's about saying it. Unfortunately, if you miss a single letter, Swifter says everyone here is going to blow you up. Unload on you. All right. That's it. That's it. So if you kill him by mistake and he did nothing wrong, then you die. So you'll only unload on him if you miss his a letter or if it is not completed within the 18 seconds. Swifter says chill. Are you ready? Yes. Yes. Swifter says chill begin. ZYXWVUTSRQPOMLKJIHGFEDCBA. He didn't know how to say it. Yep. No, he did. Oh, no. He said shoot him. Shoot him if he did. He did. He did. He did.

So does the lame aim your gun's at. Download it. Download it. You have to count backwards from 40 within 18 seconds. That means saying two numbers per second roughly. A little bit faster than that actually. So we remember 40, 40, 40, 30. I just say, what's that? Ready? Set. Go. Go 18 seconds. 43, 9, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 23, 20, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. You knew it.
