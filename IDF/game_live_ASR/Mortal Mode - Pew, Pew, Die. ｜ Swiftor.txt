 Thanks for pressing like if you enjoyed the video. What's up Unabrow? Some place of mortal mode, black ops 2. We're here on carrier. Williamartemode works as everyone will spin around one at a time and fire a bullet at random. We're all set to high sensitivity. Amuses is turned off. Last player or live wins. Those two players left, three players left. We may do a little bit of minigame. But let's begin. I'll go first. Actually before we do that. Ooh, part of me, I was drinking some coke. I'm burping a little bit. I'm trying to lay it burp politely. Anyway, pick one person from the left side of the screen. Who do you think will win? I'm on the list, but I always die. So it's all right. Here we go. Let's begin. Good luck if I shoot you. Two minutes left. I think it's less to be you. No one died. All right, good. Let's go in and say mid-eight road, your next go for it. Spin around, we'll go counterclockwise. There we go. No fatalities. Marcos. Poblos. Nope. Nido, you're up. Next up. Football. I swear, people do actually die in this game mode. There we go. Swag B. Scott Ruckby's neighbors. Just too bad, man. There's nothing worse than playing this game and not even getting a fire, a single shot. Master's lap, go for it. Next, the ventral brew. Oh, close to me. All right, Taj. Next, Zoic. Zoic. All right, defense nuclear. Next up for show. Next up, Jaden. Next up, Riverbarrel. Oh, sorry, not Riverbarrel. Sorry, yeah, TJ, your turn, sorry. All right, Riverbarrel, your turn. Too many people are alive. Let's fix that. Everyone, we're going to do a quick bonus round. And bonus round, everyone spins at the same time. And when I yell fire, you fire one shot. So everyone's been around. Fire. All right, all right. You've been down. Not cool. All right, that's cheating. Trying to crouch the dodge shot. Go to hell, buddy. All right, let's continue. See my turn. Nobody. All right, next up, Mid-Aid Road. Next up, Marcos. Next up, Nido. Next. Nurkst. Next. Next. Next. Next. Well, I forgot to pay out my bad. Next. That's pretty close to spin at 14 sensitivity and exit of the crowd. Yeah, 14 sensitivity and do not. Look down your sights. All right, guys, we're going to increase number bullet shot. The two. Please shoot the two bullets very quickly like this. Except maybe you'll kill somebody. Mid-Aid Road, your turn. Next. Marcos. Next. Nido. By the way, if you fired too many bullets, I'll return the bullets to you. Ah! I guess it won't be me. It won't be me. Of course, the second I have to write new guys, I die. Go figure. All right, guys. Go on without me. Mid-Aid Road, I'm spectating through you. Next. Why? Okay, so N Bunn and Chatt asks, why aren't I smiling? I don't know. I don't like, I don't smile all the time. You know, Kanye never smiles, but I bet he's a happy guy. I smile pretty often though. He's now that I've, you mentioned I'm not smiling. I'm like smiling automatically. All right, next up. Estage alive, no, I killed him. Intentionally. Oh, Marcos is dead. Chicken tits, 666. 12 months enrolled, you've been a subscriber, man. I appreciate your support over the last year. Thank you. CS, go hide and seek. I think we thought about it. Oh. I think I took it there. Wow, he used all his bullets. He killed both football and Mid-Aid Road. Not bad, not bad. All right, next up. All right, all right, I'm not gonna expect it. You, let's do annoying. Brute, you're my eyes. Keep your eye on the person shooting, please. Thank you. You're my eyes and my all match laps. All right, Brute, your turn. Zoic, next. Next. Oh, it's right, God. Next. All right, stop, stop, everyone stop, everyone stop, stop, stop, stop. All right, let's take a look at who is still alive. It's me for sure. It's Nito, Jaden, Zoic, Adventful, Brute, and River Barrel. All right, all right, River, go for it. I'm sorry, Nito, Nito, Nito, it's Nito's turn, Nito's turn, my bad. It's two bullets, man, it's two bullets, fire one more. I'll give you a chance, there we go. Okay, go for it, Brute, your turn. Jaden's out. Man. That's all right, Jaden, this is the next time. Zoic, your turn. Next. Next. Next. So I want to chat asked about what vote for Kanye for president. Honestly, maybe it depends on what his views are, what his policy was, how he would handle being a president. I think I'm not going to judge whether someone's a president based on what they do, what their past is, whatever. Actually, maybe they're past, that makes sense. Nito is dead. So I'm just saying, whether someone is presidential material and that depends on a lot of things. Three minutes left to subscribe, Mo Pell. Like there are a few celebrities that maybe would make a good president. Yeah, that's right, no politics, never mind, I take it back. What are my views on Trump? Trump is the man. I got to hang out with Trump, you know, a good bit over at a Pax Prime. That dude is awesome. I was selfie with me and Trump together, hang on, I've got it. I'll show you guys. Keep on going, guys, you're doing great on your own. My iPhone 6 Plus just broke on me like my touch screen doesn't work. All right, you guys have to trust me. I've got, I've got, I've got to, I've got to selfie with me and Trump. Trump is like the coolest dude. We played this game called Two Rooms in a Boom in the Sheraton lobby. And Trump was the leader of our room. And he set me off as a hostage. I think I lost that game. For sure, it was out. The Trump is great to value town, baby. It's a difficult value. Trump's the man. No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm talking about, I'm talking about Trump SC on Twitch. You guys are confused. I'm sorry, we're talking about President talk. I should have been, I was talking about Trump on Twitch, not Trump SC, not Donald Trump. Donald Trump is a Trump. No, no, no. Trust me. You guys, my bad. It's only a Vennville, and Riverberal. All right, guys, both of you guys take a corner in the middle of the middle diamond. Dude, I meant, I meant Trump on Twitch is awesome. Donald Trump, I'm not a big fan of, sorry. Sorry, sorry. I think we got, we got confused here. So now I can't even post this video to YouTube because I'm really confusing. My bad, my bad. I was talking about Trump SC. He's the man. All right. Okay, here's the way it's going to work. Riverberal. Vennville, bro, both of you guys are going to just spin. Keep on spinning. Now, keep on firing your bullets. Go. Really? How are you guys doing? No one's dead. Can someone please die? Oh my god. Well, I'm finished as ammo. All right, both of you guys grab one piece of ammo from the side. There's a little, there you go. All right, now go back. This is absolutely ridiculous. They guys haven't killed each other. All right, I want you guys to stay in right next to each other now. Go into the absolute center. All right, both of you spin around. Wait for my word. Don't fire a gun, but both of you spin around. Both of you are spinning? All right, fire now. There we go. Riverberal wins it. There we go. Riverberal, congratulations. Riverberal. Riverberal. Good game, guys. Congratulations, River. GG. Hope you enjoyed the video, guys.
