 Hey, welcome everyone. Thanks for subscribing if you enjoy the video. Gentlemen, welcome back to some crossbow roll. Everyone here's a quote the crossbow. They've got their sensitivity set to 14, the maximum, and they've got aim assist turned off. We're changing up the rules a little bit and the locations. So first I'm doing it like on the pool edge over here in black ops 2 and also players are allowed to scoot over to the left or right as they see fit. They can't crouch. They can't jump off or jump back on and they drop off. They forfeit their life. And we'll keep on going into this like, you know, two, three players left and we'll see how it goes. So the players in the top part of the ones that are their nicknames for players playing. Who do you think will be the last personal lift at the very end? We'll do like a little mini game of some sort. You can pause the video if you need more time. Bet they're now close for the folks watching live on betting is closed. Which not good luck.
