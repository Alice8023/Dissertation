 Make sure you tap the bell so you never miss a video. It's right next to the sub button. Thanks guys. What does up dudes, playing some shotgun relat. Here's how it works. We're all in a circle here. We've all got maximum sensitivity and no aim assist. So when you spin around, it doesn't slow down. We're gonna have one player at a time, spin around, and fire one shot. They might kill somebody. They might not. Last two people alive. Play a special mini game. So here we go. Let me determine who's gonna go first in this circle. It's gonna be you. All right, center. You'll be first and we'll go clockwise from you. All right, there you go. Center, go for it, man. Thank you. New Killy. I'm gonna die before I even die. That's not it. Oh, oh, oh, oh, my land. Oh, my land. All right, hang on, hang on. You do this guy. Wait, when I die, I was in kill cam after that time. Go ahead. I'm going back now. Oh, shotgun relat. This is what happens. They fell over like dominoes. Oh, bro, I knew it. Yeah, no, it's all right, man. This sucks when you don't get to me. Please, Johnny, no, Nelly, don't do this. Yes. Three people don't like what? Well, there goes sting. The H dog with the sub, dude. Thank you for supporting the stream, man. Really appreciate it. Thank you, dude. You did get killed after. You know, it doesn't really matter whether you kill or not. All that matters is that you don't die. Oh, read the address. I think I joined back here. Bro, we're in a game, my friend. Oh, no, Tiel. That was using new perspective or thing. All right. Oh, I was all set. He died. Full spins next time, bro. Full spins. Right there. Is jet dead. Jet's very dead. I'm very dead. Most players are very dead. Oh, killing is out. Try and spin a few times, guys. You're going too fast. Spin around a few times. There we go. A lot of them was the one that killed three people. One with it. Yeah, yeah. Cleared to me, sadly. I think I'll carry a piece. Should make the circle better. Nope. We're good, man. Trust me. We're good. And these things up slightly of ammo. Lying, lying, aiming for bits. Look, who is this coach? Because you're going to land up your shoulders straight in your back. And aim it around. You know, I see a baby at the floor. That triggers me. Stop. Stop. We're increasing the two shots. We'll fire two stop two shots without stopping. Spin around fire a shot and fire another shot. Letting go for it. Well, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro. You working that, buddy? All right. There we go. There we go. Now you know. Keep on going. We're going to increase the free shots. We'll see. Because there's a few things we can do. We can increase number of shots. We're getting to bring people closer together. I like the distances right now. So not that bad. It's more exciting. I feel like what's one to die in this distance. I'm going to stop. You can crash around. Guys. One more rotation. If no one dies, then we'll move people in. And bring it back down to one shot. We're really close together. I'm surprised. He's all by himself. Yeah, man. Imagine if you got killed. That'd be great. Stop. And let's move in. Small square in the center. Don't get on the line per cent. But just make yourself a small circle around that vicinity. You know what I mean? There you go. You don't have to be on the line. Make a circle. Yeah, there you go. Great. Back to one shot. That's not. God, make your smile. Oh, we'll leave 11. Thank you for the sub, man. Really appreciate that. All right. There's one shot. One shot landing. Go for it, dude. Show us what you got. There you go. Oh, lightning crew is out. And then there were four. And Versace is out. Three players left. All right, guys, make a little try. Yeah, the spirals are equally distant now. Johnny, singer, and Dixie remain. There you go. That looks good to me. All right. Go for it. Resume the carnage. Stop after this one. All right, guys, wait. All right. We can sit here all day, spin around. We can move you guys in closer. Sure. Well, I'll tell you what. I like all three of you guys to spin. Spin right now. All everyone's spinning. Just keep on spinning. And don't stop spinning. Now, don't stop firing. Keep on spinning and firing until one person dies. Keep on going. There we go. Oh, stop, stop. Dixie is dead. Dixie is dead. All right, there we go. Congratulations to Johnny and to singer. You guys made it. So are you guys familiar with the usual duel we do? Should I explain it? Yeah. All right. Well, I'm going to explain anyway. All right. So you guys are going to just meet up somewhere in the center over there. It's OK. No, I just need to meet up. Face to face. I'm going to do a duel. Shake hands. Turn around so that you're back to back. All right. So when I give the word, you know, walk as slow as the game lets you. And when I say fire, you're going to turn around. You get one shot. You miss that shot. You just wait there to die. You both miss that shot. Shame on you second guy. But all right. No moving, no dodging, no jumping, no crouching, no prone. You turn around, you aim, you fire. Walk as slowly as the game will let you. Fire! Oh, whoa. I don't know what happened there, man. It's like you jiggled your shotgun and died. Gassy Frenchman, thank you for subscribing. He was making his way around there slowly but surely. It's a cool little on-sutting. Turn around. All right. Congratulations, dude. Good game. GG. Oh, it's fun. Except for the part where I didn't get to play at all. That's the fun. GG.
