 Thanks for pressing like if you enjoyed the video. What is up Unibros? I think this is my most favorite, most favorite, my favorite scene for mortal mode. Yeah, I just love the waterfall on the background. Anywhere we're playing mortal mode. Who of these fine players do you think is going to be the last person to survive as we spin around and fire shots at random and kill each other? Pick one person from this list except for King. He is sadly departed the game but he'll be back next year. Alright, so I'll just kick this one off. One of you guys is going to die. Good luck. You mean me? What? I'm going to fix this. There ain't any fall off. And... Oh, Will Mo! Rest in peace, Will Mo. I know, man. It's a bummer. Let's go ahead and go counter-clockwise for this one. So, Jones, you're going next, man. Spin around and fire one shot at random. Alright, next. Wow! You killed the dude behind me and the dude in front of me. Thanks. Alright, next up, let's take, uh, yeah, go, Bengal. Smurfy an entire year. Thank you, Smurfy. Wow. He dunks and math, another double. This is going to be a quick game, I guess. Next. Next. Wow! Let's get lonely over here. Next, stop explosive Peter. Go for it. Alright, next up, Zesky. Let's get in high. Next up, Poker King. You're like T. Alan's going to get me. You were wrong. Alright. Give me your best shots. You're good, man. Continue. Many. Thank you, manny. Six months is incredible, dude. Appreciate the continued support. Sure, man. Oh! Wiped out. Keep on going. This side has been pretty pristine for a while. Go ahead, Peter. Zesky, go ahead. Man, the angles on this circle are just weird. That was me. That was me, you killed. That was me. Alright. Oh, Elk. You're up, man. Go for a lobster. What? What would be Peter? Zesky. He's killed, lobster. No one's just killed the lobster. Lord! Those clothes. Peter, you might want to turn down your vertical sensitivity. He'll be fine, man. Don't worry. He's doing right. Let's go. Hail the lobster Lord. Okay, I fall in. I can't get up. Alright, three of you over there. The chance of you guys hitting each other is way greater than you hit in me. Good luck over there. I'm going to a pretty good spot right now. Am I even on the bets? Oh, I'm not. Bummer. Bummer. Continue, please. Look into you, Peter. Oh, no, Webster. Sorry. Webster. Now it's your go, Peter. Go for it, man. Alright, guys, after I go, we're now going to increase number of shots. No! What the freak, man? Yeah, whatever. Denevark, thanks for doing 4 months in a row. I was going to say increase number of shots at two. Which is what we're doing. Peter, go ahead. Two shots, then stop. More quickly next time. Next. Alright, continue. Go for it, man. You guys don't have to need to wait for me when you know it's your turn. Just go ahead. Oh, I was spectating off him. Alright, it's his Webster and Peter. Alright, guys, it's time for the finale. I would like you guys to jump above you to that rocky sea with that little ledge right above you. I want both of you guys up over there. Yeah, that one, you're both looking at it. That's good. Well, you had up over there and he'll follow you. Don't worry. Head up to the little ridge over there, please. Up to the little ridge. Right above you on the waterfall. There you go. Where Peter is. Great. Alright, guys, this is going to be an old-fashioned duel. Meant in the very center of the rock, you want to make sure that you guys have as much room to walk as possible. Yeah, that's good. That's good. Alright, great. Shake hands. Turn around so you're back to back. Now you want to walk especially slow because you're otherwise you're just going to walk off and be at a disadvantage. Walk is slow. The game will let you fire. Going up. Oh, hang on. Let's see that replay. Let's see that replay. Was that was that was that was just one shot from Webster? Oh, yeah, there we go. And Webster gets it. Murdering bastard. Killed me too. Alright, good game. Congratulations Webster. I like that spot from from Marlode. It's nice and nice and action packed. Good game, guys. I see crispy. Yeah, very crispy. As always, thank you for watching, dudes. Do me a solid follow me on Twitter, twitter.com, forward slash Swift or I totally tweet stuff. Your follow would be amazing.
