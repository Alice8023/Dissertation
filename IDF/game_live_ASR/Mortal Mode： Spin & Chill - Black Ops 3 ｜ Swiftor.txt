 Thanks for pressing like if you enjoyed the video. What's up, Unabrow? Sof for another mortal mode here in Black Ops 3. We're in Redwood on top of this beautiful stump. Um... Alright, guys, since I'm spinning now, there we go. I've got my legacy Southpawn so I can spin more easily, but if I try to do anything else, I will most certainly fall off. Anyway, everyone's gonna take turns spinning around one of the time, firing with a shotgun. Last person to survive wins. I'll go first. Good luck, everyone. Oh, I'm gonna run you guys first. You are dead. That's right. Alright, we're gonna go clockwise, so person to my left hang on I have my graphic settings messed up. There we go. Uh... Dodger up next, man. Go for it. Dood. Spin around. One shot at random. Oh! Oh! Wait, why did Bill kill somebody? You were the wrong guy. A guy next to his name is Bill. Oh, my bad. Well, they both shot. It's fine. Can't go sweat, you're up next. I didn't die. Who cares? Oh! Oh! Alright. Next up, Henry. Next up, Sir Rockboy. Oh! Next up, shiny money. Next up, TK slaughter. Next up, Dan. Rust and Peace, Henry. Next up, Camel. Next up, Next. Next. Next is me. No one. Alright, go for it, Bill. Your turn. Oh, shiny money's out. Next. Next. Oh! Next. Next. Oh, there we go. Sweats out. Next. Oh no! Next. My turn. Oh, Magicaler's out. Rust and Peace. All right, Bill, your turn. Next, Sir Rockboy. No. Next. My turn. All right, Bill. Don't do anything. Don't do anything. Ah! Don't do anything. Oh. All right, hang tight, hang tight, hang tight. All right. All right, continue on. Wait. All right. You guys got to be careful about who goes next. All right. Who died, by the way? I can't even see. Anyway, three players left. Sir Rockboy, we have Dan Legit and Camel. Who's turn is it? It's Camel's. Camel, go forward, dude. Sir Rockboy, go ahead. Dan Legit, go ahead. Oh! All right, gentlemen. Change your control. Leave your sensitivity at high, but change your, uh, your stick layout back to normal if you need to. So, uh, you guys will be doing a duel. All right. You guys both have controls that are working okay? Good. All right. So, meet in the center of the stump. All right, great. All right, shake hands. When I give you the word, you're going to turn around so that you're back to back. I'm going to let you know to walk as slowly as possible. And when I say fire, you're going to turn around, aim and fire one shot. And then, you know, you're going to be able to do a little bit of the same thing you're going to turn around, aim and fire one shot. There's no dodging, there's no jumping, no crouching, no prone, you turn around, you aim, you fire one shot. That's your only chance. All right, guys, turn around so that you're back to back. Whoever's phone is vibrating, please meet your microphone. All right. Walk as slowly as the game will let you. Fire! Oh! Damn, Dan with those cat-like reflexes. Let's look at that replay. Beautiful. All right, well done, Dan. If you enjoyed that, I think the shotguns worked out really nicely. The stump on Redwood. We will return to this map. Good job, guys. Congratulations, Dan. Good game. Except for you, Bill. Screw you for killing me. Good game, guys. I'm not...
