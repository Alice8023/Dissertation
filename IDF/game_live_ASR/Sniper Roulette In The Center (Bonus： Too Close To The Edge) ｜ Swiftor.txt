 Make sure you tap the bell so you never miss a video. It's right next to the sub button. Thanks guys. What is up, Unibralz, we're playing some snapper or left. Well, for the first round anyway, we'll do another game for the second round. For the second half of the video. But in snapper or left, spin around. If I reshot it random, someone might die, someone might not. Last two players face off in a duel. So, but this one, I think we'll go back to doing it in the middle. So I'm going to pick someone at random. And when it's your turn to go into the middle, spin around, fire shot. First player is going to be this guy. That's where I was standing hang on. Yeah, you. Oh, it's Zoe. There we go. Zoe won last match. All right, so we're going to go counterclockwise for this one. So Zoe just hop in the center. Spin around, fire shot. Don't kill me and you'll be good. Good luck. Go ahead. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I can't marry in the middle. In the center, my friend. Ladies go to here. I'll show you. Zoe in the center. Look at me. Yep, this guy, the ball got in the center. Yep. Nope. Yes, you go in the center, you're going to spin around, and then you go, fly or shot or random. There you go. Looks like you have any connection issues. Nope, nope. You're. I think it's because you're the one bar. Yep, that's that McDonald's Wi-Fi is kicking in. I love you McDonald's, but the joke's too strong. All right, there we go. Nightmare, go for it. There's always been having some mushrooms. All right, spin around, fire shot. Great, good job. Back-in-line soldier, next person up, video center. Look, Zoe, you got to get back in line. Have a good one. Yeah, for real. Yep, there we go. Get one bar. Let your mom know she's stopped down on all those. Oh, wow, damn it. We're going to get all the own down there. All right, make sure that the aim assist is off. Are you know what, if you don't have your turn, just go ahead. Look at the dust. Go for it, man. All right, got it. It's horrible when you start before your time. Yes. This is one of the few game modes where you can die with that I'm getting to play at all. Genes out, next. I'm winding card, Joe. No. I'm going to fly. Sorry. Next up. Oh, that shot looks like a moving. Hang on. Oh, yeah, stay in order. There we go. Go for a Vader. That's just. Once I can guys actually wait, swam on. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, pardon me. Oh, man, that was not a very manly sneeze. But yeah, I'm ready to go. Thank you for any blessings. Rifleman, go for it. Go for it. Go for it. That's all you aiming at me. Don't think I don't know. Thank you guys for the blessings. I'll take them all. I need all the blessings I can get. That's not really the metal, bro. Nope, that's not the middle. Good enough. Good enough. Yeah. Keep on going. Keep the momentum. Next. Man, it's getting quiet. I'm just worried they'll be next to be shot. All right, Lanny figures out. All right. I'm next. Then we do a bonus round, boys. And girls. Nothing. All right, guys. Not for a bonus round. Oh, yeah, here we go. That's my spot. All right, bonus round. Everyone spins. Spin around. Yep. Everyone's spin. Someone we lost the circle or whatever. Fire! Oh, wow. Oh, yeah, three victims. All right, you, buddy. You on the sidewalk. Yeah, dead waves. Get off the sidewalk, bro. Step up. Yep. Take a few steps forward. There we go, man. That way you're level over. What else? You, guy who just went on the sidewalk. There we go. I want you to be level. All right. Zoe, you're up again. I'm going to return positions. Nope, not there in the center. There you go. All right, keep it going. Yep, next. Next. Next. Whoa. Hang on, hang on, hang on. Buddy. Imagine this is a circle. There you go, Vader. There you go. Much better. You're very close to me then. Basically, walking part of the... All right. Scared. Aim me at me again, huh? Is he going to hit me? Don't think he will. No! Wow, you shot me like rolled forward. I thought we got you then. I swear. The bullet went all the way to that sign right there. I mean, I really doubt you could aim at me and shoot me unless you're like, phase optic clan, pro. It would be cool to get a dude like, let's say, phase acne in the game to see what he's like. You begin like, pick the person you know he's going to kill. I know he's really good. 360 YYWY ladder stall claim more fakes. Oh! That was jack. Damn, Jack. He's simply close to you too. All right, guys, after my shot, we all move in to make the circle a little bit tighter. Hang on, sorry, man. There we go. There's all close to me. Nothing. All right, ladies and gentlemen. Everyone moving a little bit? Keep the order the same, but I just want you to be a bit tighter. A little bit tighter. Same sign, right? Yeah, I mean, it's a little light on this little dense on that side. That's a collateral way to happen. Let's try and make it so that it's spacing is a bit more even. I'm pretty particular about this. It would be easy if I turned on the mini map for everybody, but... You know, it's just your funeral, I guess, whatever. All right, Zoe, go for it. Someone's going to die. Or not. Take that puddle. Next. What are we going to get it? Oh, all right, Bitter. Dead waves. Wow. We're about to get to see the kill. Almost, man. You almost forget it out. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what? You walking right in front of me? Pro? Get back in line. That was that. No, no, no, no, you're done. You're done. All right. No, no, no, don't jump or dodge, bro. You stay right there. All right, it's my turn. Here we go. Good luck. Wow. Nope. Zoe, you're up again. Whoo! All right. There's no need for you to grab the bullets, man. You've got plenty. Whoa, hang on, hang on. Where you going? There you go. Don't get disoriented. Next. People in Chasing have never lived this long. I've won a couple of these games over the years. I've been doing this mode for like six, seven years. I've won a couple. Literally two, I think. Honestly, never. You definitely live longer than the last one. That is true, man. I don't like being the first to die. It's not cool, bro. Look, look, buddy. Move your ass into the center of the circle, line in front of my face. Thanks. There we go. You want to aim at me fine, but. Don't walk in front of me. All right. Look, buddy. You got to stop moving around. Stand up. There we go. When I aim at me, go ahead. I dare you. You like aiming at me, bro? You like that? Do you like it? Fun? Don't kill him. Oh, that was close. You were close. I didn't know. It was obviously super luck. There was no skill. It's all luck. There's no skill. It's all luck. Holy crap. Yo. Who is this guy? Are you doing a D.D. bro? Just stand still, man. All you got to do. Stand still until your turn. All right. There we go. All right, man. Go ahead. Holy crap, man. Someone didn't take their pros like today. Dude, back up like a step. Yeah, whatever. Just go. You're not going to make the shot. Just go. That's right, man. That's right. Walk back and shame. You want to try again, too? All right, buddy. Let's see who dies first. Let's see who dies first. We're going to need to tighten the circle. Yeah, soon. All right, I just want we can tighten up a little bit. Everyone moving. Moving. Wow. This is a... If you're offended by my reference to ADD, then I don't know. I just, I don't want to be all politically correct. So you'll just have to, I don't know, sub, if, up sub for me or something. I don't know. Or tell your mom to call me. All right, Zoe, go ahead. Please have your parents call me the expressive display. All right. Get tri, Zoe. Centaur. Man, I feel like everyone's... Well, I guess they're just close to everybody. All right. Stay where you are, boys. No moving. Oh! Damn. All right. You want to try it? Go ahead, man. Go ahead. No! Oh! Yeah, guess who's turning it is now, buddy. Guess who's turning it is now. I'm not even gonna aim at you. I'm still gonna get a stand up. If you're actually killing me. Yeah, it's all luck, but it'll sound cool when I actually do it. If I actually do it. Centaur, go for it. I apologize for my dog's behavior. The dog wasn't applying mold on my breath. No. I keep on telling him no scrub. Get good. I don't. Oh, knives is out. Oh, man. All right. Rifleman. Yeah, okay. Back your ass up to the center of the circle. All right. Whatever's left of the circle. Look at that! My boy, Fumin' the house. What's up, homie? Everyone's aiming at me. How's that distracted-oid life? Close of my turn. I got so. I'm just gonna aim in the distance over there. Whoever's gonna die is gonna die. Maybe no one. Oh, nothing. I like Centaur's idea. Go the opposite way. Didn't work. Aiming at him? No! Don't get all excited, asshole. You didn't kill me. All right. Well, I'm out. Which means I get some good, uh... The effects, man. All right. Oh, so I bet you glad it isn't green that, Kildger. This isn't aiming at a circle anymore. What is this? This is like people gathering out on the south of a gas station to share Twinkie. Let's reform the circle, guys. Five of you guys left. All right. No more going in the middle. You're close enough that you can just do it normally now. Stay in your spot and spin. No dice. Is beta coincidence? What the no? I think everyone says no like that, but it's good. You know. You do a long no. That's just one of this. All right. Rule change after next shot. All right. Increase number of shots at two. So you keep on spinning, but fire two shots before you stop. Wait, wait, wait, wait. It's not your turn. Yeah, it's... It's sent to us, turned. There you go. Just like that. Go for it, bro. All right. Nice. Oh, what? Did he get somebody? Oh, we got the guy with ADD. Damn. Rip. All right. Vater. All right. Then four remained. What was that? That honestly looked like... All right, dust. Give me the money. Hmm. Not quite. Rule change after this one. All right. All right. Wait a second, guys. All right. Go ahead, man. Continue two shots. Center, two shots. There you go. Oh! Oh, I don't know. Look at the replay. What does it show you? That's how I guess. All right, guys. Three of you left. Here's what I want you to do. I want you all to keep on spinning. Someone already knows. Keep on spinning. All of you. Just spin. When I give the word, I keep on firing shots until one person dies. Go. Keep on going. Stop! Just fucking luck it. Dust is down. All right. Congratulations to Green. And Video Centaur, you're the last two players alive. Make your way toward the river, my friends, because that's where the finale is going to happen. Make a right. Make a right. Make a right. Now what? Consmetto. Consmetto. Where are we? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right there. All right. Now hop on the, on the edge over there. Don't fall off, though. Yeah, exactly. All right, cool. Now move back a bit. So that you're maybe more in the middle. You want a lot of walking space for both directions. Video Centaur, back up carefully. I would look where you're backing up, by the way. There we go. It's a little safer there. That's good. Video Centaur. All right, arrow. Come forward. This is, this mode is simple. You're going to shake hands, turn around, so you're back to back. And then you're going to walk as slowly as the game will let you. When I give the word, you're going to turn around, and you have one bullet to spend. You can't dodge. You can't jump. You can't go into prone. Your only job is to turn around. Aim. You can scope in if you want. And fire one shot. Don't touch your sensitivity. It has to remain the same. All right. Let's continue. Shake hands. Shake guns. There we go. Turn around, so you're back to back. Walk as slowly as the game will let you. And everyone else will remain silent. Fire! Oh! Arrow, arrow. I think if you pull, if I think if you just pull the trigger, he tried to like find who's shot. I think if he hit that, got that torso shot open, all right. That was close to that. Yeah, this, this man just went for a peer and simple quick scope. Yeah, wow. Yeah. All right, good job, Centaur. Congrats on the win. We've got another bonus game coming up. Brace yourselves for some too close to the edge. Same map, same spot. All right, here we go. Bonus round, too close to the edge. And too close to the edge. You're trying to go out just far enough so you're not the closest person to the inside. That doesn't make sense. It will vary shortly. So, here are the rules, guys. We're going by your entire body. Your gun. Your knife. Your feet. Your shoes. Your fingers. It doesn't matter. Your entire character. So, to be very careful what you have out, having your gun out, your sniper rifle out, may or may not work for you. I have no idea. We're going to try and make sure you're not sticking out the most. So, many of you guys, about 5, 10 seconds, the kind of like, you know, adjust yourselves. Then I'm going to go freeze. After freeze, don't move at all. I can't move left or right. You can't crouch. If you move, I kill you. I kill you. First or kill or Steve kills himself. Alright, whatever. We get into the bets now, by the way. You can pick some of the person who you think is going to win this game from this list. Pause the video if you need more time. Alright. So, like I said, it's really important that you stop moving when I say stop. Alright. So, you guys have 10 seconds to adjust yourself, starting now. 10. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. Freeze! No more movement. Freeze. Freeze. Stop. Don't touch your controller. That's it. Don't touch your sticks at all. Nothing. Now, my goal is to see who's sticking out the most. Alright. Let's see here. It's curved. That makes my job a little harder. But I'm going to go based on the, uh, on the B. Let's see, or the, uh, curve. Alright, this is an easy one. The issue here is the snap of rep will stick it out. So, dead wave. Oh, come on. Dude. Well, agreeing the arrow felt pretty bad about it, so he'll drop off also. Alright, congratulations guys. The rest of you made it to round two. Remember, max, the only person that's a die is the person sticking in the most. Alright. Time for round two. You have ten seconds starting now. Ten. Nine. Eight. There goes Centaur. Seven. You don't need to stick out the most. Six. Five. Four. There goes Zoe. Three. Two. One. Freeze. That's it. If only he froze. If only he froze. Alright, no more movement while we do our examinations. Oh, yeah, this is an easy one. That knife is sticking out there. Knives. If you're facing the other way, you might have been okay. Alright, congratulations. You all made it round three. Guys, have ten seconds to adjust yourselves. Okay, 40. Daddy's shaking. It's too late to play, man. Your corpse is gone. Wow, look at that, man. It's a work of art. Alright, here we are. Anyway, ten seconds. Ten. Nine. You don't have to move if you don't want to. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Freeze. Hmm. If you're dead, you can kind of help me like, you know, judge. Because it's spectator mode, you can more safely do it. He's knees out. Oh, yeah. Goddamn, that might be him. All screams. Yes. Yes, I agree with that. Star scream. Good try, man. Star scream is out. Congratulations. You guys all made it to round four. Alright, we're going to do a reset for round four. So when you come back off, that's right. All that hard work and get to the edge. You got this far congrats. Off the beam. They're off the curve. What do you want to call it? There we go. Alright. Now you guys can hit. Oh, wait. Attest. Off, bro. Dust. There you go. That's alright. Alright. You guys got 15 seconds to hop back on. Go for it. 15. 14. 13. 12. 11. 10. 9. No worry. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. Alright. Definitely. Definitely. Yeah. Poor snail. Poor snail. Rip. Rip. Alright, Rip. Alright. Alright guys, time for the next round. 10 seconds. 10. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. Oh, Lanny Ficker. No coaching from the beyond. No coaching from the great beyond, bro. Let them do their thing. Alright. 1, 2. Alright. Time for the judge. Let's see. I want to jump to conclusions. It's a Calib. It's a Calib. It is Calib, sorry, bro. Alright, congratulations.
