 Thanks for pressing like if you enjoyed the video. What is up, Unibrowz, we're playing some sniper rola aka mortal mode here on Havoc. I love this location, it's very sunny. Um, the water looks great. I'm here with friends who are gonna kill each other. A good time is happening. Pick one person off this list, who do you think is going to survive? Oh, it's gonna match. Alright, let's get started. Um, I'm gonna pick someone person to kind of go first here. It's gonna be... Oh, alright. Mark is, I guess. Alright, we'll go clockwise starting with you, Marcus. Spin around and fire. I was just using... Okay. How does that feel you're gonna die first? Flux, you're next. Oh! Well, that's awesome. Oh, what the... Gentlemen, slow down! I need to witness these deaths. Oh my god, until... Oh my god, that's what I was thinking about. Nice to have you. Racer, go for it, man. Go on, Racer. Rusey's dead. Wow, this is a lot of bloodier than last time. You know it'd be cool if like the water actually turned red. Racer's dead. Dinyard. Whoa, skew, and thank you for subscribing, dude. Look at that. Wow, you don't really see many five letter Twitch names. Like, you know, ones you can actually read. Skew must be old school. Here we go, and... Nothing. Alright, here we go, Marcus. So he's here, though, but we're not. It's part of the circle of life, man. Go watch the line, can you teach y'all about it? Oh! Oh! Whatever, circle. Oh! Oh! It's Racer. Alright, Laggy McPhase tab, you are my eyes, sir. You're my eyes. No, I just did a look. Do not fail me. I will not. There you go. Alright, there you go. Oh! You've failed me for the last time. Sorry. That's not any was good, though. That double kill. It was not good, right, darling. Not a positive thing for everybody. I hear that, man. Remember to stay in your same spot. Ah, he's low. Nice. Nice. Nice. We're fixing brightness there. Yeah, it looks like... Oh! Russian's out. Yeah, close that. There's like 15 spins. That's so apparently just so close to me spinning. After the yard, let's stop for a sec. Alright, everyone, move in. That's a bit closer, though. There, let's get this distance. We're going to do one bonus round. And bonus round, everyone spins. When I yell fire, you let it rip. So guys, spin around. Everyone spin. Full speed. Full speed. Whoa, whoa, whoa, chill, bro. Where if you fire your gun, don't fire again. Fire! Oh, I don't want this. Alright, no, dude, chill! Stop! Stop, bro! Stop! Fire once is what I meant. I think he thought he was a bigger, happy round. Yeah, alright, we've done that before. Okay, thankfully not too many people have died. Alright, let's continue Marcus. Oh, that was so close. Oh, fluxes out. I think I quite, but I'm just waiting to see what dies. It's actually any way to spin like that in the water, like in real life. I don't think so, right? Like, you know, if you're standing on the ground, sure, you can kind of spin yourself and get dizzy. But in the water, I don't think there's any way to spin fast, like even fast in the circle. Maybe we have one of those personal fans and he's a pallor to kind of make yourself circle. Need any professional grade, waterproof. Alright, please stop. Everyone move closer. Much closer. Alright guys, let's do one bonus round. Everyone to spin, you're only going to fly our one shot when I give you the word. The buck, thank you for something four months in a row, dude. Swift you in the past. Glad to be a unique. Thank you, man. Fire! Alright, no fatalities. Alright, here we go. Let's continue. Marcus. Oh, snap. One year. That one year, between now. Killer Niel. Thank you, man. Oh, Marcus is out. Next. Look at that apple floating in the water. I don't know, for some reason I find this very soothing to watch. It's just chewed. It's the water, man. This is the sound of the water. Bracing this being implemented. It's like the Olympics. Yeah, man, there you go. There's only one medal, the gold medal. Because everyone else is dead. Lobster lord. Praise the Lord. Lobster lord. 16 months. Oh, a chill is dead. Alright, that leads us in yard and let's, what? Chill, chill, chill. Alright guys. Alright. So let's do a duel. Now this duel is important. The last thing we did is I had to kind of like rewatch it. Because at the end, the person who won the game actually moved like swam to decide. So the way this is going to work, you guys are going to shake hands. Turn around, so you're back to back. Then you're going to swim slowly away from each other. So the slow is the game will let you. And then when I say fire, you're going to turn around and fire one shot. You can't swim from the left to right or move around. You're simply twisting yourself. The same way you spin. You're going to spin around. And then fire your one shot. You guys got that? Let's shake your hands. There we go. Turn around so you're back to back. Perfect. Swim is slowly, wait, chill girl. Swim is slowly as the game will let you. Fire! Oh wasted. Daniel, it's free shot. Free shot for Daniel. Daniel, congratulations. Wait. You're the winner. You're going to show him by the laggy. Yeah, you got it. You got it, you got it. That was so off because I had one sensitivity on. Yeah. I thought it was on. I'm ready. Yeah. Let's go, right? Yeah. Run the heart. Well, lift her. Live and learn. Die and learn. Good game, guys. Yeah, as you're the best for being fans, appreciate you watching the video. If you've got Snapchat, add me. Leave your name and Swift or. I'll see you guys next time.
