Now, the rest of this is up to your skill. So you guys are going to shake hands. Then you're going to turn around and they're back to back. And when I give you the word, you know, walk as slowly as the game lets you. When I say fire, you got to stay in that spot. You can't crouch, you can't jump, you can't dodge. You're going to stay in that spot, you're going to turn around, and you get to use one bullet. You can look down your scope, leave your settings the same. You get it? Not up and down if you understand. Shake her head if you don't. Good deal. Alright. Walk as slowly as the game will let you. Fire! Oh, no, guys. Alright, Legend Killer is the winner of this game. Well done. Let's do one more round. I don't like that I died like in the first minute. That made me sad. Oh. Solid. I'm not going to rip it between us. Oh. Right. You guys trying to curve that Snapper bullet there too? What was that? Alright, well done. Alright, zoom one more round. Alright, time for round two. Code name redemption.
