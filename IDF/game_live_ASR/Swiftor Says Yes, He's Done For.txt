That's actually isn't done. Swift says make sure that someone on your left and you're right. Not in front of you or back or behind you. That's how you get your circle going on. It's tied on that side over there. You guys. All right. Swift says welcome to our 2024 New Year's Eve dance off. Our first participant's going to be the first person to crouch. Just getting to the last person to crouch. It's hard to test, you know, fly people one in the center. Let's try it again. All right. Swift says last person to crouch will dance for us. My name. I'm not sure. No. All right. Seems like we're having some difficulty with the whole crouching proning situations, but just come to the center of the circle. What's your name? It's a baby. Baby Yoda. Maybe you're doing consider yourself an accomplished dancer in real life. Oh, fairly. Oh, wow. Yes, I think it's like that. All right. If that's a case, man. So does the owner show us a few of your moves in the game as best as you can? OK, I can't really line dance on here. So it's kind of. Swift says stop. How can I help you line dance? How can I assist you? You're line dancing. Do you need to do the partner? So it's easy. Oh, no, say less. Last person to stand is a dancing partner. Who says I got you two dancing partners. You two come to the center and say, super says. Now, have you ever seen that color duty clip where they had the the cha cha slide in the background could do it like that? We're going to let we're going to let our bro here handle this. What are your names, guys? Dark Lord and dark dark. All right. What does that say? The order these two guys are are you're going to instruct him to perform your dance routine as needs. What does this go at? Tell them what they need to do. I need you to sing the cha cha slide for me. If you guys aren't sure you're going to ask for more information. You have to ask more information. Yeah, can I can I can I do this? Can I would like to volunteer and singing it? Yeah, the trucker's light is an American thing. People from other countries might not know. It's okay if someone doesn't know something, you can teach them. So go ahead, you had her teach. American song. I forgot how to sing the song. That's why I need somebody to sing it. All right. So if you just stand up, if you like to sing the song, there are you have two people, three people want to sing. All right. So does the three singers. So it just comes in a wall with me. We got to get in a line right here. Make it. Yep. Yep. So is you guys on the wall, please? Which is you two guys over here. That's fine. Which is you three can stay where you are. That's fine. All right. So which is like you three to sing together. So get in sync. This is the beginning. All right. Ready. Three, two, one. This is the cast for slide part two to the left. Take it back now, you all. One hop this time. One, two hop. Right for a less stump. Got it wrong. You left for a less stump. Chacha, real smooth.

He was doing the lyrics wrong. And I couldn't stop him. All right. What matters more? The guy who's in the lyrics or in the guy who has his mic from you to the entire time. Think about it. All right. So. All right. All right. Three of you guys is great. Please return to the circle. No. Oh, no. Oh, my God. Was that Yoda who went back to the circle? I think it was. Yeah. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

You're going to show us a brand new dance routine. Yep. Donnering bullets. So it says everyone in AM at Yoda's feet. I don't want to kill a brick. That's why you're aiming at the feet, bro. Right? Don't worry, man. Don't worry. Don't worry. I've done this before. He's a trained professional. People are usually sort of safe. All right. Here's the way it's going to work. So it just says Yoda, when I say jump again, I'm just going to fire one bullet at your feet. And you're going to jump at the same time. The idea is that they will fire their bullets under you, and you will land safely. All right. You're going to see it. Ready, set, jump. Oh my god, Emmy. Emmy. Emmy. Emmy. Emmy. Emmy. Oh, he just disappeared. Just gone. It's just like Thunderboard. Just disintegrated. Just like Thunderboard players, please follow me. Oh, I just like Joe was there, and then he's gone. That was like a police. I see him. I do. You can see, man. All right. Steve, if you're says, please, please, let shoulder to shoulder along the Western wall over here. No, I'm standing next to this guy, because he's got the skin of my favorite beverage. What? Mountain Dew. Mountain Dew, I would know that. Don't be banning your men. Don't be banning your men. Don't be banning your men. That's all I'm going to say. All right, great. Max, next to you, you're a trophy. So we had a fun, one of the 12 minutes of gameplay just now. Wow, wow. What amazing content. Thanks to you guys. Now it's time to murder a bunch of people. I can't fit all of you guys on my screen. Let me see. I have to like back. Yeah, there's too many players. It's time for me to go to die. We've only killed what? Two people? Unacceptable. So yeah, let's do it. Swiftress, let's look at the person next to you. Look them in the eyes. Swiftress says, if you don't have a partner, I will assign you one, and you're not going to like it. I friend. I know. I know. I don't have any idea. 321 Swiftress says freeze. Swiftress says if you're not looking your partner in the eye, come on down. I got a drink. One, two, three, four, five you guys. But it says you five only. Lap, shoulder to shoulder over here. Yeah, good. OK, you don't understand. Swiftress says you five only. Shoulder to shoulder. Right. Swiftress says you five only. Look at me. Swiftress says it's only a plus of five players so I pulled out of the line. All right, there are five of you. It's an odd number. Only four of you will actually have partners that you're looking at. Five of you will get your partner in the eye. One person that will die. Hey, guys, good. Swiftress says you five. Look your partner in the eye. You over there. Get behind this guy. Oh, wow. Good. The partner's out behind you. Swiftress says you turn around. I lied. All right. How does he get her? Yeah, he was very quiet this game. I'm surprised. Yes, he's making it for some reason. Oh, yeah. If you're talking, your microphone's muted. All right, great. Now it's time for bad things to happen. Chattano. Yay. What's going on? I don't know if I like this. And don't say. All right. Swiftress says listen to this quiz question. Swiftress says no more talking. Now sometimes we get a year. So leap year, where we get some extra days for worry. This is a leap year. Maleer partner now. All right. If this is not a leap year, maleer partner now. What does that stop? What is that? What's going on? How come I don't even love you time? Because you don't know anything. Man, why? 10 million. He was just super the same. So I did look at the calendar, but he did not say anything. I didn't know he was activated. It is actually, he was well. I always died to dog Lord's ignorance, man. Why? I'm sorry. Oh, this is a Swiftress says, bro. No. Oh, my god. Nobody said winning a Swiftress says game was easy. I'm sorry, I need to go. I got this. I was going to be super significant on his bike. All right. Swiftress says, if you killed someone, please come on down. All for him. Come on down. Messing up, player. Who is that? Go home, player. All right. So it says stop. Swiftress says, you too, over here, rejoining the line. So it says we're in the big line. Jolder to shoulder. Don't need to look here part anymore. So it says, look at me. All right, we survived. I'm here for now. For now. Not done yet. Yeah, exactly. For now. All right. Swiftress says. I was really going to kill the home winner. You won. 101 million. Not two. Just as the four of you, please go on that little patio over there behind you. There you go. All right. So there'll be certain things happening, but only one. But maximum one of you will be escaping. Swiftress says, all of you guys up there, go into prone. All right. Swiftress says, everyone in this line over here. If you have a lethal throwable, just you may throw it up there if you'd like. It's like this. You can like no need to. Wow. Yeah. And you started a game. Well, I'm seeing. All right. There's no need to. Yeah, I just killed all four of them. They're dead. OK. Oh, there you go. Good. Good. They won. I was saying, I'm telling you, Tia. Bro, this isn't the same. Tia, I want to love you. I'm sorry. Thanks. Love you, Tia. I love you, didn't have to. It was if you needed. You didn't have to. All right. That is not enough people dead, by the way. Swiftress says, look at your partners once again. Oh, everybody. A trustable opponent. Don't judge me based on what I just did, please. I care. Go lack the outfit. I'll dare you, Tia. I can't. You like it? I can't. So I see it in space, but I don't see anything else. Swiftress says, no more talking. Hoofdor says, crouch. Swiftress says, stand. Swiftress says, jump. Maley. So it just says, crouch. Swiftress says, go into prune. Maley. Yeah, he also did say his self. It works better. I don't know why. You weren't putting that set? More yet. Oh, well, such a shy. It's a charm. And Darm is doing so much. He just got fisted. So does Archbishop. He's doing so much. He just got fisted. So does Archbishop stand over here? Oh, no. All right. It's firing squad. Does everyone stand up on an A-Mit Arch? Can I give the command? Oh, no. You've won. I know. I know. I know. I joined. I joined. All right. Swiftress says, everyone stand up. It'll be Arch and Kwebel. Can I give the command, please? What? No. No, you did. No. I really didn't see it. It's Swiftress's job, man. Yeah, man. I'm highly qualified for this occupation. Don't worry. But does everyone aim at these two players? I'm going to go. Remember, you don't have to shoot. Remember, don't shoot when I say unload. Oh, good. Unload. Very disciplined lobby. Swiftress says, unload. Oh, is that exclusion? All right. Swiftress says, stop. Swiftress says, please follow me to the basketball court. Play some groups. Hey. Good job. Good job. You too. Another one. That would be eight. Swiftress says there is an outline around the playground over here, where the sand is or whatever it is. Swiftress says, get on that outline. Guys, we don't need to be split out, please. Move around. But I want to be next to stupid. Oh, you don't. I don't want to be next to you. Get away. Get away. Really smart. All right. Swiftress says, you've chosen your spot. Hopefully you feel good about it, because now the game is going to be a floor is lava. When I fire my gun, if you are not sending any of the slide, the two merry go rounds or that purple car thing over there, you're going to die. Ready set? Go. Swiftress says, freeze. Not this guy. Swiftress says, sir, what is your name? T-glock. Swiftress, please. T-glock. He survived the first round, but now has to answer. Swiftress, please stand at the very top of the slide here. Swiftress says, please aim at T-glock. Once he's up there. Oh, my God. I'm just glad he didn't use that RPG, Jesus. No one's allowed to do that. Any last words? One load. All right, I'll take it. Swiftress says, unload. All right. Swiftress says the floor is lava. Go. I'm not anyone on here. I don't care. Everyone's looking pretty good. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for it. Look at stupid. I've got lava proof boots. Don't worry about me, guys. I'm OK. All right. Swiftress says, freeze. All right. Everyone actually survived that one. Good job. I think we removed too many players. This is now pretty safe. All right. Unfortunately, one of these four items have become unsteady. They weren't very well built. And it is sinking into the lava. That item is the purple car. Yeah. Yeah. It's a sinking. Oh, man. No. Great. Two. Swiftress says, freeze. No. Swiftress says, freeze. I made it hard. I never said Swiftress says. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm a sucks person. No. Oh, my God. How easy did he do that? OK. Swiftress says, follow me. We don't have to play around. I love how it was the car that wasn't randomized. It was the freaking car about randomized. All right. We're at the cemetery now. Swiftress says, I think we have a few enough players that we can fit every single person on top of one of the larger tombstones. What does this freeze? Here are the tombstones at a legal. The ones that are tall like this, OK? Not the baby ones like this one. Maybe one of the taller ones. You know what? How tall are these? Two feet? Yeah. Give me tall, whatever. Yeah, I got some over here. You got some over here. And these can fit like two, maybe three. I'm pretty sure too. Anyway, Swiftress says go stand on top of one of those legal tombstones. Hmm. Plenty around. You're plenty. Wow. Don't even need to share. But we had tombstones as bare. Great. Swiftress says, aim at any other one player. No melee, bro. Actually, no. This will be guns. Let me find a good angle to watch all of this. That's a bad feeling to people at aim at that. Could be. What if I have one player as Swiftress? No, no, no. It's not me, man. I'm not aiming anybody yet. You guys got plenty of bullets. Don't need me for this one. Oh, god. There are two people to shoot, man. Yeah. All right. Swiftress says no more talking. Swiftress, look at the timer on the left side of your screen. It currently says 1835 for me. And it's counting down. One says says 1820. Kill the person you're aiming at. Eight seconds. Five seconds. Three, two, one. Go. Yeah. Yeah. Swiftress says, stop. What? Swiftress says, staying. I did not say Swiftress says, what is staying? Please pull me, man. You kidding me, bro? No. I'm sorry. I've been recovering from a procedure. And this is my first time back. Dude, you survived much longer than others. But don't worry about it. All right. Swiftress, please. Everyone aim at staying. Swiftress says, I'll look. I'll take it. Damn, senna. Hope you have a smooth recovery. All right. I'll be sticking around. I know. Senna is like wild today. Great. Swiftress says, any person you want. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. You're a person you want. Swiftress says if someone is aiming at you, you can give in somebody else. Or if you want to be a bull, you can give in to everyone to aim at one person to minimize losses. This time I'll actually ask you guys to, you know, actually fire. I think it is a- You realize the past behind you's looking at you. That's not a thing. Yes, we need to aim at this guy. I do not want to kill my favorite beverage. I will. So I want to kill this man over here. You're looking at me. I want you to do if you don't look at me. Am, Tervor Lee, look at the dude behind you. Am a- The sky with the blue gun. Yeah, blue eh.

So it says this will be melee only you must remain on the wall Swift says every time I name a state as part of the United States of America We'll reduce the number of people in this wall I won that means we're gonna go from Seven six five before the finally three Swift says if you fall off the wall you automatically die Swift says the game is begun. Listen carefully for any United States states Actually one small rule if you're not from the United States. I think it's not fair for you to play So if you're from another country and you can come on down. I'll be gonna play the second mini game come on down Wow I want to fall for that. That's too bad. It's okay. Oh, no, that was a trick. Oh look behind you.

Let's go over the names we got G-DegG CP Mac and we have someone who actually hasn't killed him in this game wow violet This is violet This you Well, I feel like if there's oh if there's anyone who's like alive at the end of the game that's killing by it's always you Here's the kind of like like in the shadows watching yeah, yeah, well, he's a pacifist Passive this not a pacifist. Did you do you try to kill anyone this game? No You believe you can win this game without killing anyone? At the right attitude. Yeah, I like that all right great So if just says I did not kill enough of you guys have a kill streak this game unfortunately But I do have proximity mine and a smoke grenade haven't used yet. Do you just has a three of you please follow me? God bless you I like using this building. It's a very simple layout With the siege building yeah, yeah, we're not doing siege this time. No, we don't we need four players for that one But we will yeah, we're gonna have a Gonna reduce the number players from three to two Maybe from three to one. I have no we could get you out of the way so So just as the both three all three of you guys I'm going to put down a trap in this building There he is good All right You can use any path you like which was the last person to reach me dies go Oh I thought no thing is I was trying to avoid the route where the proximity mine was and I didn't know where I was going I'll see you in the last piece oh my god look look look I was hoping that someone was screen watch or something or come with the idea to kind of take the shortcut. I kind of banked on that all right Well, welcome see you back there appreciate all right great you two guys made the finale now we've no players for siege All right, Swiftress says while as the person is killed nobody this game You will have to take a life what yeah choice would you like to be the defender or the attacker in this case? I'll explain what the rules are the defender um can be in the center. What's that will be the defender? Yeah, okay, don't you want to hear what's it's cool. They've already agreed. So that's fine the rules are the same I'll be the attacker all right great So the attacker can use their guns The defender can only melee but The attacker is the one who has to enter the building Defender can be anywhere in the building you know sneaking being around a corner. So you know I feel like defense always has the advantage so It was valiciege yeah, yeah exactly. It was about going inside the building anywhere you want you can move around the building however you'd like So it says come on down CP Mac All right, see if my siege skills can be put to good use here. There you go. Breach and clear, all right So while your only goal is to melee CP Mac before he He shoots at you. He can you he can fire through walls. He can you can you know he can wall bang You gotta be careful here All right, so just says CP Mac shoot me Yep, let's shoot me there we go. I need to I need to spec that your view We're gonna get uh All right, hang on. Let me just make sure I All right there we go. I want to do a wrong one I want the camera view There we go. Okay, all right as a full ads. I don't know if CP Mac were you looking at the stream at all or no I was not Okay, there we go. Okay, so it's fine. No, no, yeah, that's fine. Okay. I did show that location very briefly But that's fine. All right. The game is simple While you must stay in the building the entire game This game finishes when one of you guys are dead TP Mac can use his guns. He can also melee if he wants. Violet you must stab you must melee Swiftress says again I'm rooting for your CP map All right, come on, baby. Yeah, cool. Well, thank you very much. Oh my Oh You Bro I can't I can't use your No, hang on back out Bro Pull out the heartbeat Bro I have to point a CP Mac Bro you're already advantage of the gun All right, Violet as a heads up. You did pull out the heartbeat sensor so you may have some additional information Oh, man, what to do. What do I make you use your your I think Violet you should use it. No, let's just say one Be one See, CP Mac is as offered to simply use melee. Okay, there we go the game continue both players will be using melee again Oh Wow, I'll applaud you from there, huh Wow And Violet thinks Listen up.
