 Swiftress says everyone else? Ratch around them. Swiftress says everyone who's crouching aim your guns at either player. Alright, what I'm trying to do here is create even more tension. Everyone's aiming their guns at you, you guys are aiming at each other. Lightning dart, kill each other. That's pretty good. Sorry, bye red. Alright, when the smoke clears, only you two can shoot each other. It's still clear. Very good. Very good. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. Lays and Jummin, that is tension being released. Swiftress says on load.
