 Thanks for pressing like if you enjoyed the video. What's up, you interbrows, we're doing some... Mortal mode, and Mortal mode you spin around in the circle and fire at random. There's only eight of us this game. Should be pretty quick. I'm gonna go first. Good luck and don't die. Nothing. Next up. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. And next. That was a very uneventful round. We're gonna increase the number of bullets fire to two. Snapper is dead. Next. That was three bullets. Let me return that extra bullet to you. You're gonna have to grab. Next. Next. Next. Damn. Next. Next. Next. Careful. Keep the order. Next. Next. Next. Rob. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Go ahead. Next. Keep on going. Oh! Whoa! What? No. Are you kidding? How sick. Uh. Uh. First uh. First game was swift and I kill him in moral mode. You ready first to stop. You guys are gonna do a duel. See in a second there. Does me in the middle guys have you guys seen a duel before? It's where you shake hands, turn around, walk as slowly as possible. And when I yell fire. You turn around and you fire one bullet. There's no jumping, no crouching, no dodging, no moving out of the way. You turn around, you pivot, you aim, and you fire one bullet. Shake hands. Turn around so that you're back to back. Walk as slowly as the game will let you. You. Three aim. Yeah, you can aim. Fire! Oh shit. That's right. I wouldn't give you guys a better angle but I was still on South Pa. Lake Sea South Pa. That was in bad. Think I watched the replay anyway. Oh what? My murderer wins? Of course. Good game guys. Good game. Congratulations Doug. Doggy. We'll have a good one's the name. You murdering bastard you. GG. Hope you enjoyed the video guys. Follow me on Twitter for updates and special events. What I'm playing and more.
