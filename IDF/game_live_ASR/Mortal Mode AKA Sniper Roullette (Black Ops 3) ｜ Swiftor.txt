Back to back, guys. And Walker slowly as the game will let you. Higher! Well done, Dell. I want to see that shot. He did that really fast. I thought I was going to... Oh, I don't see it. Goddamn, I am not a fan of the way these kill cams work. This is not the final kill. If that was not the final kill. It's worth the win. All right, well done, Dell. Good game.
