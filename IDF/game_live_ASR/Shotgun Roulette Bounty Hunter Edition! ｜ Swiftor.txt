 Swift Go! What is up, Unibros, I saw specific requests for some more... More relight in the comments, so here we go. And we got a bunch of fine folks, we'll soon be dead, probably myself too. Um, here I'm Block Ops 2 on Standoff, right? Yes, yes me glad, I'm happy when I can remember the map name. I'm sometimes mentally challenged at the Department. All right, so I'm gonna stand up with their high sensitivity and no aim assist. If you don't have that set up, you're just gonna get shot. So, let's just gonna go first. When you're up first, you go to the middle, you're gonna spin around a fire single shot. And the person to go first will be... Oh, he's up there. ... not a control here. Hi Pazard, it's you. Yay, okay. So, knock that thing off for good luck. All right. Are we going clockwise? Well, hang on a moment, hang on a moment. So, we're here on the top left. This is a list. A lot of people seem confused when I talk about this stuff. Basically, this is being recorded on... It's closed. Good luck. My bets. I was talking about that. Well, anyway. Anyway, we do bets at my live show, twitch.tv4 slash Swift door. Any of the moments gone. All right. Hi Pazard, please spin fire. It's okay, I'm not... It's fine. All right. Hi Pazard, back in the line. We're going to go clockwise. So, bouncing. You got first? Oh, yeah. Yeah, there you go. Next. All right. See you next. Just come and go over. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Look, go back to your spot. There you go. That was two in the row. T-bone, come on down. Let's spice this up a little bit. T-bone, you got a microphone, right? I do, yes. All right, T-bone, I'll tell you what. And this is open to anybody who goes up. If you can call who you actually kill, I'll send you a trillion Swift bucks for my personal territory. One trillion, if you call. You have to play fairly, no aim assist. Yes. Well, your turn's over. T-bone, do you want to make a bet and who you're going to hit? It could be anyway, could it be me? It's like calling which, you know, where you're shotting and, you know, in pool. I'm going to kill you with this. If you do. All right, all right, go for it. Go on like you see them. Oh, jack, jack doesn't count. Oh, that's so close. Don't get half a trillion for your game. Well, do you, look, no, you get, you can get, I can give you payment, but it's not the kind you want. You're out of the save it for my turn. Corey. Corey, who's picking? Lonzo. Of course. All right, Corey, go ahead. All right, there we go. Jack said he knew it was coming. All right, hockey beast, you need a microphone. I want to hear your voice to make this bet. hockey beast, what do you think you're going to hit? No one. Get a microphone. We'll learn. All right, well, you killed somebody. There we go. The reason you see him kind of zigzagging on the way back to his spot since he's high. No microphone, mega dot, go for it. Corey, your mine. Oh, oh, wow, wow, oh, yeah, yeah, boost it. Wait, that was pretty slow. I didn't notice. All right, I missed it. I'm 14. I can take it. Right now, been again, been again. You had aim assist on then. You got something on. No, that looks legit to me. I'll keep an eye on it, dudes. I don't, I don't, I don't sense any foul play. Whatever. All right. All right. Well, I'll keep an eye on it. All right. Crazy square microphone. Yeah. What are you betting on? Oh, what are you doing? Sting. Sting. Oh, I feel a boy. Oh, all right. What are you doing? I know which one you're talking about.

You're next. All right. I'm, I'm calling. Who do I? Soapy. Soapy. All right. Go for it. Nobody. Now, obviously, as the player count reduces, your chances of like being right go up. So all that you guys know that when the offer is done. No, that's all. Soapy, are we betting on soapy? I'm going to do Bob. Bob. Bob. All right. Bob is like, give me your best shot.

Sting, who are you going after? You're looking for the guy? You're looking at you? And I'm just deciding about... Sting, for Taybonne, if you get a mark, give you a trillion of soapbox as well. All right. Okay, Taybonne. Where's Taybonne? Where is he? Oh my god. Get him. All right. All right. Whoever kills Taybonne has get a trillion of soapbox, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I think swift, I think it should be swift, whoever kills swift. No. No. Am I incentivizing you killing me? I want you to call your shot. Oh, Frank. All right. All right. Well, it's my turn. You know? You just point out. I can't give myself points, but I will guess somebody. Please switch. High pass, I think I'm going to hit you with high pass. Another burst, and I just think, I think that's where it's going to end up. And oh my god. No one. That one in between me and I. Okay. All right. All right. Slick. You're point to get me, of course. I know. Go for it. If you kill me, if you kill me, I'll give you 10 trillion. Less for you. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

I think you can leave it alone. Does it look like this one? That's the reason. Okay. Hold on. Someone's laughing. You're going to be, confronted, then grateful and pyro. What's up? Yeah. Hopefully the guardianship things will work. It will work, you wondering. This is the one. Come on, don't worry. If I kill you, do I get 10 trillion or just a one trillion? No, that was just him before all the reasons. OK, I'm going to get you get the normal deal. I'm killing people now. People is not on the bet list. All right. He's throwing blanks. Sorry, he's throwing. Wicked, wicked. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm sorry. I like it. I'm a little old. Once we reach eight players remaining, my deal will be off the table as a heads up. Can't make it too easy. D-bone. We all think I should kill hype. You won't. All right. I hope for a man. That's what your heart tells you. Oh, my little endorsement. I'll be more spent next time. All right. Let's see who's next. Who's this? Corey. Me. I'm going for Furious. What? What? I want it to happen. I want to see the call happen. All right. Now, I would go for two trillion. But Corey put a lot of money on sniper last time. And I don't want to talk. Megadot, you got no bets. Corey. It looks. Corey. All right. Woo. How did it go? I don't get one for me. Kurt, hang on. Hang on. I guess I can go play about. I'm like, right there, man. Where that little weed is, that's like the center, right there. Look down. Well, that's that's good. No, no, no, no. That's the weed. There we go. You're going to little do gloss to me. I didn't feel comfortable. I'm going to put stuff in. Personally, I'm going to go for starting soapy. All right. Go for it. Make it up. Oh, that seemed close. He's like a close to me. What the heck? Oh, no. Oh, no. All right. Bouncing Bob. No, you can't. Bob. Bob is like, Bob is like, come at me. Yeah. Nobody. Yeah.

Where's the right spot? I kind of kind of chase. You told me. I'm going for Megadot. Megadot? All right. Oh. Oh, my God. Whoa, sleepy. I don't like that I'm in the way, but you know. I'm going for a split. Who said that? Wicked beast? Oh, yeah. Get off the weed. Get off the weed. Get on the weed. Get on the weed. Oh, that's why it's close enough. That's close enough. That was a general guideline. No one's what it. Get on the weed. Don't get on. All right. All right. All right. Here we go. All right. All right. All right. I'm calling a... I'm calling a... Singer, I think I'm going to hit you, man. It's another burst of logistics for my heart. Oh, good. Oh. Oh. Oh. I'm actually not. Yeah. Same bet. Same bet. Fine. I'll assume your bet's always the same. Go ahead. Same deal. Tentually. Go for it. No! T-bone. T-bone. No, you want to kill you. All right. I think I've got to kill you. So what's your bet, Lonzo? Um... Take a doll. She took a little bit of the box. That's the first time. For what? Oh. That was super close. All right. All right. Hmm. I definitely go for it. We're here. We're here. Oh, actually, hang on. Let me go for it. All right. I was going to hang on. Wait. Oh, there's my... It's going to hang on. So we've done a couple of rotations. We've landed like a handful of things. like a handful of people die six deaths. Let's have everyone move in a little bit. Move it. Let's tie it up the circle. Your odds are getting better. I think the fight is going to be so much better. I don't think the lead is pretty cool. All right. Well, certainly change. You guys are running up on burning up to his back. Come on. I'm on the other side. That huge gap. Let's see. Slick moving. That's pretty good. All right. I go for it. What's your pick? That's not my pick. That's not my pick. I'm on the back. Cory. Cory. All right. I'm on back. I'm also going to pick Cory. What the? All right. I can't blame you. Oh. Geez. Hey, you're a little, a little far back there. Guys, I want you off the curb. Everyone should be on the asphalt. All right. All right. All right. Everyone, everyone should be on the asphalt. Move in. Move in. There we go. All right. Looking good. Oh, no. And Cory, move like one step towards me. That's good. All right. There we go. That's so dead. I'm the person. I had to move towards me. It's good. Yeah, no problem. To get a double, I was hit. Oh, my God. Double kill. No. As you slip, dorm. Come at me. I can't. I can't. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I was killed. You overkill me. All right. It's one whole swift buck. OK. I'm going for Cory. That's a pretty hefty off. Cory, why is Cory so popular? I mean, I target. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Thank you very much, everyone. Hang on. Hang on. We got our first winner. No, no, no. No team back. I can get back. Maybe lying. I can't help it. I think I've been hit. I think it's a smith that before. Swifter. One trillion sent to Megadot 82. Sent. All right. All right. Back in line. We got our first first winner. All right. Crazy square. Where will you pick him? Oh, crazy. You're going to pick two close, crazy square. Slick daddy. I like that bet. Go for it. I wish you luck. Fuck. Oh, for us. All right. Hang on. Hang on. Oh, my God. All right. I was going to do close. Oh, all right. Who you're picking? I think you should choose him. So I could choose you. I like picking. Wicked beast. Wicked beast. Close. That was a second winner. I think we will. I mean, I'm going to stop and reach A players. There's just a little bit of a little bit of time. I think we need to see what's picking. Look daddy. Oh, yeah. Go for it. Oh, nobody. All right. What? I'm going to bet it's going to be who haven't I picked on yet. Right here. I bet Megadot does. I think he's guys trillion. He's got a good guy. He's got a good guy for me. All right. I mean, we'll see. You know, this thing has a range. And nobody. Oh, my God. I'm going to do that. I don't like that. Yeah, yeah. 10 trillion. Go. Yeah, yeah, I know. I'm going to do it. Oh, a shame, a shame, a shame. All right. I have a kill swift. It's my last trillion. Yeah. Yeah. Now Jack is getting in the last trillion. What happened? How did Jack start fortune? I don't know. I don't know. Oh, man. Yes. Who said if I kill Swift, I get a trillion. I said that. Well, I don't know if that Swift. So that means if I kill Swift, I'll get two trillion. Two trillion in a man. I don't have a whole trillion. Oh. Wow. OK, so I think that thing is going to be the one that kills me. So I'm going to kill him before he kills me. There we go. Oh, why is the Lord? Hunter becomes a hunter. No. All right. Next, what do we got? What's your bet? London. London? No. Kill him. Three. I can't fall, Megadoyze away. Oh my god. What? I should have played Megadoyze. I'm not going to please this end to the circle every single time. Yeah, I thought it was too close with. Oh, I'm really close to the game. Megadoyze. Oh, I got it. I got it. Oh, man. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. My name is Caleb Lee for five, six. Hang on. Let me just send this one over. I'm about to type in chat. OK, pogas. Sent. Sent. Do I actually have enough money to like pay the stuff out? I lost a lot of money. You're the richest guy that reads. You're not. I was the richest for like a total of five minutes before I got some really bads going on. I've got enough. I've got 200 trillion. I'm fine. All right. OK, we could beast. What's your target? What are you looking at me? Bob. Careful with the knife there. Yeah. It was a little singer. All right, we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. All right, that's it. My offer's now on the table. Oh, it's a 500 billion now. I think we're done. All right, who's next? What was it me? What's me? Yeah. As the odds go down, you know, I'm not funding this this this gambling anymore. Now we're just going to see who wins. It's me, Lonzo, Bob, Cree Square's beast, slick and stink. Here we go. Come on, Swift. Get a kill. One. I didn't know you guys could have. So it's sadly not happening. I mean, I don't need to get killed. I just need to not die. I think you should get out. You're not getting any money if you kill me, but go ahead. Wow. That was a little fast, man. Got to get some spins in there next time. No, no, get back it. Wait. What are you doing? I'm just complaining. You must say you need a free spin. What the hell, man? All right, Lonzo, go ahead. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. That's what I was saying. You know. That's what I was saying. That's what I was saying. Oh, if you kill Swift, then you know what you don't need as ammo. You got plenty of shots. All right. You can talk to me. Wow, go ahead. Why am I wheezing? He's like a two. Is good enough. Hey, crazy. You're way too close. Crazy. He's fine. He's fine. Go ahead. Yo, that's crazy. That is wow. Yes, we got it. Good pun. All right. Swift, can we rearrange this so? Yeah. I think we're bringing it for now. Oh, I didn't make a pop. Oops. Sting, you want the circle to change? Oh, yeah. It's me. Right. He's a white. Oh, dude. It's swear. Hey, you know, I'm supposed to be on the curb. That's true. Oh, sorry. That is true. That's the reason I died. All right. We're going to this left. We're going extinct. I'm thirsty for blood. I want to see some more. Oh, nothing. Nothing. All right. Let's go, Lonzo. Mom, please. All right, bouncing Bob. You'll be the last one before you do a circle change. Oh, thank goodness. All right, everyone, move closer. How much? Too close. Very close. Very close. This is going to be, it's going to be fast. There's one, two, three, four, five, six of us. That's a funny question. All right, spectate people who are dead. I need your help. Yeah. Once you see four people die in the kill feed, I need you to yell stop. All right. Because I want to part and say this as well. Well, well, well, well, buddy. Well, buddy, you're back. You stay exactly where you are. All right. Stay right there. OK, everyone's going to spin, including me. And when Jack yells go, you're going to start firing like crazy. When there's only two people left, you stop. And I'm going to need, I'm going to be focused on firing. So I need everyone else to help set y'all out stop. All right. All right, here we go. So whenever you're, everyone spin and Jack, whenever you're ready. All right. Gar. Come on. You sure? No. No. Stop. That's it. That's it. That's crazy. Oh my god. Swing to the finals. Oh my god. It happens, boys. Miracles do happen. Round of applause. I mean, you create squers. Lucky for you. I'm a pretty bad shot. All right. Yeah, I'm surprised a little. Can I be the commentator at this part? Yeah, sure. Why not? Why not? Yeah. Let's go and go on commentary. That's fun. Yeah. Are you want to call it? That's cool. I like it.
