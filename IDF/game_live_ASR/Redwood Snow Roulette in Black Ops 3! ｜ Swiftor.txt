That's that's exciting stuff. So we'll see. I know there's a lot of people thinking to me boots on the ground We can tie about later. I wanted me boots on ground. I'm gonna love the game no matter what But I'm a feeling it's not gonna be boots in the ground, but it'll still be good. Anyway, discussion about that we can talk about while we're playing. But we're playing snapper, let players win their chose and we'll come to the center, spin around, fire, shot at random, and maybe someone will die. So let's see what's going first. And it's gonna be you. Jack, oh it's Jack. Guys, listen Jack, or was I standing over here? Jack, oh there you go. Alright, yeah, so just remember we were saying guys, alright Jack go and make a way to the center. You shoot me. He much, you're gonna get it. There we go. I'm sort of ready, he's gonna shoot me. Go ahead. Are you allowed to crouch? No, stand up, stand up. You can set your vertical sensitivity to one if you don't want to like wiggle. That's what I did. No fatalities. Alright, alright we're gonna go, I'll go last, let's go counterclockwise so the due to your right and the neon green and black. Wait, wait. This is scary. Did you guys know that Wade is the college roommate of Wal-Martini? Yeah. Yeah. Does that sound good? Alright Wade, you want to be in the center of the center of the stump over there, there we go. And yeah whenever you're ready man, spin around. No. And we lost. Ghost killer is out, rest in peace, ghost killer. If ghost is first I'm leaving and then epic, epic you call it man, you jinxed it. Someone in the chat, he didn't even see this video yet, I'm waiting for rage. That's all, go about look at it. Alright. Am I allowed to aim in on my side or no? No, no no sides, it's a roll out, supposed to be like somewhat random. But you're in phase so you know, it doesn't matter. Yeah yeah, it's just shit. You know, you don't need to go out. He's in for it. Yeah, yeah. No, that's not what you do, that's not what you were standing to the right there. There you go, remember where you came from. My Susivi's 14th started to control this thing. Yeah, that's the point. Rick, go for it. Shoot already. Come on man. That's not where you were standing, I wreck. There you go. Remember where you were standing boys. Alright, cardinal, good luck. I mean, you don't need to, like you're not like you're gonna die. Good luck to me. Alright. Alright, next. Alright guys, tell your bed and your mama, you love them. Oh, that was a King of Rules. Rub it. Alright, next up. I capsule. Wow, reapers out. It's the worst when you're gonna take one shot in this game. I've been there though. I've been there. Mad about guns, turn aim for me. This guy's like a walk and pow pow presentation. Look at him. Look at him. There you go. There you go. You're good. No, the gop, you weren't standing. I'm coming back. Don't understand, man. You might want to close and find that. Oh yeah. That was him. Alright, stand up, stand up by the way, King King, whatever. So what was his name? It was our point, man. Yeah, yeah, stand up, dude. Guns, man about guns, stand up, dude. You have an unfair hitbox advantage by crouching. He's really like an graphic character. Alright, just go. Alright, we'll let it slide. Go ahead, go ahead, Jimmy. Spin away. So if I'm out of back, I'll just slip. Oh, oh. Phase wolf is out. Phase out of this game is more like it. Alright, next up, we got upstroke. Go ahead. I'm dead. Good bye, oh. Good bye, cruel world. Bye. Alright, nicely done. Alright, big newbs go ahead. Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That's him. That's him. Kind of slow, man. Make sure your thing is at 14, not looking down your site. It seemed pretty slow to me. Alright, Mizzy, quiet, come on down. Uh oh. He just crawling. He was going all the way. No. I see it. That's it. See you go for Jimmy. Oh, my God. Who are we in the background? Do I hear Martini? Oh. Second, let me post your talk. That's fun. I've Oh no, he's right in front of my face. Martini's one of my favorite people. Alright, Owen, good try. Alright, it's my turn. I didn't die. Can you believe it? How many videos of my post-war? Does die like within like 20 seconds? Alright, here we go. And nothing. Alright, where was I standing? No one else can view. I think it's right over here, right? Yeah. Right, so what? Alright, hang on, let's not go yet. I'm going to do a quick bonus round. I need everyone to spin full speed when I say fire, fire, single shot. It's like everyone's spin. Everyone's spin. There we go. Everyone's spin. One of you guys aren't spinning. Nubes. Nubes. Nubes. Fire. Alright, there we go. Who knows? Who knows? Alright. I wreck. Go for it, man. Y'all knew it was going to happen eventually. We all knew. We all knew. Alright. Alright.

Spin around full speed, nubes. That looks good. How come you weren't now? Now spin the way you're spinning in the center when you're looking down your site. He was not doing that. That was not the same at all. Not the same. Don't look down. Don't look down your sites, man. Alright, back into the circle. Hmm. Alright. Alright, missy, you're up. Missy's like he's disappointed. He was hoping he would get the excuse, buddy. You have my name in your plant. Oh, this is great, bro. Alright, back back into the circle. Missy, I'm rooting for you. Alright, alright, you're up. Why are you so close to me? Oh, mad about guns. Because now that PowerPoint file is in the lead at next. Pull power up, man. Everyone's gotta be careful because they're on set to other sites. That's not a good move slide. I was using him. Russing piece. Alright. This is Jimmy next star. Go for it, Jimmy. I just don't know how to do it because every other time he's just got zero and died right away. It's a game of chance. Mostly, mostly game of chance. I'm sure there's some folks out there who could still pull off a kill. They got that. They actually got two. That ridiculous sense. The ridiculous sense is. Perhaps. It's all you. Are you allowed to use reject? No, you're not. Just die. Just die. I'm trying to get this pretty annoying if you have it on. Okay. Alright, gentlemen, hang on. I'm leaving. There are five players left. We usually went into the three players up. We're going to do it now. All of you guys are going to spin around. And when I say go, you're going to keep on firing until there's only two players left. So, so, gentlemen, everyone spin. This beat. Mars should sick pass. Yep. Alright. Alright. I'm going close to neither Jesus. Now keep on firing. Unless you don't want to stop. Keep on going. Oh, it's like. Oh my gosh. Alright, one more. Keep on going. Keep on going. Keep on going. Is that over yet? Done. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Alright. I can go out to the license for a flying two players. Jimmy and I capsule a few people. Oh yeah, look at that. Jimmy got four people. He's got like, he's summoned but deadly. Like me on taco night. Alright, so let's go ahead and take. Alright, gentlemen, let's go find a straightaway free to use. Yeah, the bridge will work. That's good. Good call. No, no, since he stays high. So let me explain this is in case you're not sure how it works. You're going to shake hands. So like, you know, look up and down. My tent. My tent. My tent. My tent. My tent. My tent. My tent. And when I give you the word, you're going to turn around so you're back to back. Make sure there's plenty of room to walk in front of you. Yeah, plenty. Good. Now here's the deal. You only get one shot. You can't jump. You can't go into prone. You can't dodge. You turn around. You pivot. And you fire a single shot. You can look down your site if you want to. But you take your shot. Now one thing that people make the mistake of is when one takes a shot. The other guy immediately takes a shot and sometimes misses. If you, the first guy takes a shot and they miss, you win. Just take your time. Aim and kill the dude. Don't screw it up. All right, so, Jumman, I was supposed to be luck. Remember, neither no matter what happens. Well, you guys did a great job surviving. So walk as slowly as the game will let you. Everyone else will remain silent. Fire. Fire. No, we both miss. They both miss. Capture. There was some, uh, some moving on your part, dude. What was up with that? He was, he was dodging left and right. I think that would have hit him too. Yeah, man. What was with that dodging, dude? And he can get in. What was what was happening there? I don't know. I'm still going to understand. What was that all about? I just want, I just want to understand. Who fired first there? I think I think Jimmy. Yeah, Jimmy. Who's Jimmy? Oh, okay. Remind them. Uh, Jimmy, wait. I'm going to call a redo. This time, no movement whatsoever, dudes. All right. All right, back to the middle of the grid. You guys are a little too far out in that direction. There ever, there we go. Jimmy, they're off. I'm going to call, uh, Jimmy, go a little closer to the center of the bridge. Please turn around. Jimmy. All right, great. All right, guys, get ready. A little bit more silence. Gentlemen, move as slowly as the game will let you. Fire! Did you guys both miss? Yeah. Oh, dear. We shot at the same time. Yeah, wow. Okay. All right, one more time to the center of the bridge. If this isn't work, then I have another plan. But I want to do, I like the, I like the duels. They're intense. All right, gentlemen. Block as slowly as the game will let you. Fire! Oh my gosh. Yeah. And Jimmy gets it. There we go. Third times. Third times something, I guess. All right, way to go, guys.
