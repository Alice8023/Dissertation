 Hey guys, thanks for brusting like if you enjoyed the video. Yo, what's up, you know, bros, we're doing some third person snapper rollet in Monwerefare 2 on Skid Row. Uh, there's no aim assistous force and it's a little bit awkward in third person, so we'll see how it goes. Anyway, the first player to go will be you! Coyote. Alright, Coyote. We're gonna go counterclockwise. Oh, there's a gap. Yeah, you guys need to be hugging the... No, no, not on the center, man. Back on the side. You'll be on... On the outside. There you go. Is room for everyone. Yes. Hug the person to your right to make some room. There we go. Alright, sweet man. Go for it. Spin around and randomly fire a shot. Are you kidding me? There were like 5 people between me and you! 5! I'm sorry. Hey, hey, hey, don't shoot him. It had to come. Just go. Just go. Good try. What? Can I go pick up your sniper because I don't have one? Ember, go. I think it's after the next... Exactly. When it's your turn, we'll grab it. It's close to counterclockwise. Counterclockwise, guys. Hang on. Why does he have a sniper? He's got a magnet amount. Yo, yo, yo. You know, he's a pistol, bro. It's a magnet. It's a magnet. Yeah, it's a sniper or what? Not a magnet or what? But not all of us had access to a sniper. That's all good. Well, you're just gonna get skipped until you pick up someone else's sniper rifle. Next player. Oh, good back in line, man. Going to pick up your sniper. He's a sniper. No, I was waiting till someone dies. You go ahead. Look, just...no, no, dude. What do you...dude, go back in the circle. What do you want? I have to get back in line, though. Yeah, bro. You don't get some free pass. We're gonna have the sniper rifle. Alright. Alright, next. Next. Alright. Oh, there you go. Grab a sniper rifle. We're gonna get it. She didn't have the sniper rifle. There you go. And that 86. Next. Alright, next. They got it. They got it. No, this is an... Another kill. This is a pretty awkward game. Alright. Brilliant. Oh, collateral. Oh, it's a quad feed. Oh, my goodness. What just happened? It was a bad one, dude. Oh, well, it's gonna happen, boys. Amos is the zone. Oh, no. So it wasn't even looking at him waiting to shot. I guess, too. I guess I... Okay, enemy is. Oh, no one's dead. I'm going a little wide over here. I'm so alone. Oh, no. You're an easy target, my friend. Actually, you might be in awe. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, my God. Keep on going, boys. No, don't move around. No, stay where you are. You survived that long in this spot. Keep on going. I believe in you, guys. Oh, no. Come, guys. Oh, I'm waiting for him. Oh, I am off, dude. I am off. Oh, and that's it. That's it, boys. All right, hang on. Let's see what our final two players are. All right. It's Zoe and Falcon. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. OK. No. We're hoping get to avoid that. So, we're hoping it's going to be alright. So, Zoe and Falcon. All right, way to go. All right. We can do it. Keep your sensitivity. Keep your sensitivity at maximum. OK. What I'd like you to do is head to opposite sides of the playground. Yeah, just go out. Like, one of you guys should get behind this dumpster or something. Maybe behind. Go out, need that corner over there. Go out, need that corner over there. Behind, like, this sandbag over here. Further back, further back, behind. bags. Let me see here. Yeah, Falcon's turn around behind you. Yeah, that right there. Great. And let's see. Zoe, you want to go a bit from back. Zoe behind you, the dumpster behind you. There we go behind that one. To go to the right, we want to make sure you have some cover. There we go. That's gonna be simple. One B1 snapper shoot out. Anything goes as long as you're using your snapper rifle. As long as you stay on this part of the map, don't go like whatever, other parts of the map. Ready, set, go. Oh, good try, Zoe. That's rough. That's a rough thing to do. No worries. I want to dive faster than you did. I did, actually. All right. Good game, guys. That was awkward, but fun. Dude, as always, thank you for watching my videos. It really means a lot.
