 Thanks for pressing like if you enjoyed the video. What is up, Unibroza playing a quick game of Mortal mode, AK, Snapper, or like, um, here we go. In this game we're gonna spin around one at a time in a circle, fire shotguns, and so it might die. Alright, who am I gonna choose to go first? Let's see here. Anti-pro you're going first, randomly selected. Alright. Spin around, fire one shot whenever you're ready. I'm gonna die first. And but whenever you're ready. No! Good job. Alright, next up it's, uh, Theska. Future and mad. Wait, actually no, no, is it Theska? No, it's... I was so young. It's Neo's turn. Hang on. Wow. Unfortunate. Alright, buck you're up next. Another guy you're spinning pretty slowly there, man. You sure you set the 14? Yeah. Double, double check that. Alright, Tex and your turn. Wow, this has been a death every single turn now, huh? Lows out, next up Gabe. Gabe of Thrones. Oh, there we go, no fatality. That's just too bad, because it's my turn. Oh, Tex and... Alright, next up, Allerin. Allerin. Keep on going. Daniels. You see it, bro? Maybe if you didn't move, you'd be fine. Keep on going. You got better? I don't know, I guess so. I didn't notice. Nothing. Oh, that could have been me. But it wasn't. That was so unlucky for me too. Yeah, man. There's aim assist disabled, but this is a pretty... That's so bad. Sorry. Yeah, yeah, but you're sorry. Alright, keep on going, boys. After the next rotation, you're moving into a smaller circle. Oh, rip that, bro. Keep on going two more. Daniels, unfortunate. One more. Alright, keep your order. Move into the center circle. Thank you. Alright, continue. Tell Dark Queen to move closer. It's all good. Continue. Oh, buck is out. Purchasing that three more. Damn it. Ghost game result. Three people left. Continue. Two people left. Alright, it's Neo versus Gabe. Alright, gentlemen, you know how the game works. Step to the very center of the circle. I want one of you guys facing North. One of you guys facing South. It's my hand, you're more on. Oh. What? Oh, yeah. Yeah, shake hands. There you go. Alright, turn around so you're back to back. I'm going to ask you guys to walk as slowly as the game will let you. When I say fire, you'll turn around and fire one shot. There's no jumping, no dodging, no crouching. You turn around and fire one shot. That's all you get. Walk as slowly as the game will let you, gentlemen. As slowly as the game will let you. These movies. It's just sliding. Fire. Oh, fall. Did you guys both miss? Yes. Yeah. Wow. Well, attention for nothing. Alright, redo. Back in the center, boys. Alright, shake. Turn around. Walk as slowly as the game will let you. Fire. There we go. There we go. Got to be ready at all times. Alright, well done, Neo. Good game, guys. Good game. Let's see that, that final kill. That kill. Not bad, not bad at all. GG. And thanks for watching, guys. As always, thank you for watching the video, guys. Unless you skipped the end. Either way, if you've got Snapchat, consider adding me. Swiftore. See you guys next time.
