 Thanks for pressing like if you enjoyed the video. What is up, Unabrowz playing some mortal mode on the original New Town here in Black Ops 1. In mortal mode, players take turns, spin around one at a time, firing a shot at random. Last two players lie, play a little mini game. So, I'd like everyone to spin around in a circle now. Let's say you got your setting correct. Looking good, guys. Alright, so since I'm not actually in the bets, we'll let someone else go first. Alright, let's see here. King of Sassan, go for a man. You can spin around at least once and then fire one shot at random. Oh, hey hang on, hang on, hang on, guys. Wait for me to get your name before you go. Blades your turn, bro. At least for the first round. I want everyone to know who you are. What the hell? Remember, guys, wait for me to call your name. Alright. Gears, oh sorry, not gears. Bubba, your turn. Alright, next up, gears. Koval, your turn. Snap your monsters out. Dark Snapper, your go. Master's lap, go for it. Black Hawk, go for it. Wait, wait, alright. You can't look down your sights, alright man? Spin around, full speed. There we go. Rest in peace fusion. Alright, fat to your turn dude. Spinner on at least once. Alright, I see your turn. Spinner on at least once, we're firing the future, my turn. And... Bubba's out. Alright, Swift Blades, go for it. Soapy, go ahead. I'm gonna do it. Gears. Koval. Snapper. Master's lap, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, dude are you looking down your sights? Your aim assist is off. There we go, that's fun. There we go, go ahead. Next up, Black Hawk. Phantom. I see. Oh, that was cool. The people that killed me. Alright, hang on guys, hang on. Hang on. Alright. It's hard for me to see your names now, so... It's an anti-... Alright. Go ahead and continue the game. I think Blade Swift Blades was next. Koval is dead, next. Go ahead. Oh, Black Hawk. Go ahead, next. It sounds like you're saying Black Hawk. Next? Next. Go ahead. Keep on going. As soon as the person before you go, you can go ahead. I see, next time you must have been around in a full circle, dude. Oh, dark. Go ahead. There we go. Oh, mighty. Alright, five players left. Soapy's dead. Alright, everyone stop, stop, stop, stop. I'd like you guys to move into a smaller square. Not too small. But not too big. Keep the same order. Alright, Swift Blades was next. Go ahead. Blade is down. After the next kill, I want everyone to stop. Go ahead. Alright, there we go. We have two finalists. We have Icy and Gears. Congratulations, guys. Alright, I'd like both of you guys to head over to the street. To the street, boys. The street? The street. Can they not hear me? Gears, how? Go to the street, guys. Go to the street, guys. Go to the street. So, guys, head to the street. Go to the street, guys. Can you guys hear me? Yeah, we can hear you now. Oh, you know, I think it's because I was expecting any of the other team. Interesting. Alright, this is good. In between the two trucks is great. Alright. Alright, so here's the way this is working. This would be a duel. You guys probably already know how to play, but that's fine. You guys are both going to shake hands. Then you'll turn around so that you're back to back. I'm going to ask you to walk as slowly as possible when the time comes. Yeah. And when I say fire, you're going to turn around. I'm going to fire a single shot. You're not allowed to duck. Dodge, jump. Go into prone. You turn around. You aim. You fire in that exact spot. Alright, guys, let's do this. Turn around shake hands. Shake hands. There you go. Good gentleman. Good gentleman right there. Alright. Walk as slowly as the game will let you. Fire! And Gears gets it. I see fire first, but Gears fired better. Gears. Good job, Gears. Another win. It's the second win in a row. Well done. GG. Did you enjoy that? Drop a like. As always, thank you for watching, dudes. Please be a solid follow me on Twitter, twitter.com-fourtslar-swift-or.
