 Hey guys, thank you for watching and I hope you enjoyed the video. What is up Unabrol? It's time for another game of Relat. This time, Snipe Relat. I'm using the car. They're using whatever bolt action they want. Well, which ones do you guys pick? Car. All right. Sounds good. Cool. So, you're the list of names. People in the game. This list isn't showing everyone, but you kind of get it. Who do you think will be the last person? Last two people that survived play a little mini game. If you've watched this before, but let's just play the game, right? Let's begin. So, let's kill the bets and I'm going to go first. We'll go clockwise. Good luck. No one. All right. You. You. Person with the leads. They used the, they didn't take off your undercover training. Go ahead. I didn't take mine off either, I think. Oh, my bag. I didn't know we were supposed to take it off. It's cool, man. I will know who you are when you're in the kill feed. All right. Next. Oh, look at that. Yeah, I have no idea who you are. Take your turn. Buddy, you forgot the file again. Oh, shit. I will say, I mean, this is probably just how the snapper rifle sound. But not as satisfying as the fans, your stuff. The more modern snapper rifles, right? Shhh. Very swivey, but shhh. Oh, there we go. Get our first kill. One more. All right, guys. We only have one kill. Sting then, tie around. I want everyone to spin. Keep your guns. Keep your guns, you know. Level, chest level. Spin around. When I give the word, you get a fire once. Fire! There we go. Wait. Oh, Clovin got a collateral. That's what happens when you stand in the straight line with other people. It's supposed to be a circle. That's on you, buddy. That's on you. All right. My turn. We're going to start firing tubel ups this time, guys. So it's going to be like, bam, bam. All right, got somebody. Start. Sluck. There we go. Keep on going. Two shots. One after the other. Almost got me. Next. Ah. Next. Slow down there for a second. Next. We can pick up other people's snipers, right? Don't move. You have a sniper rifle. You don't need another sniper rifle, dude. Brandless is out. Next. You move from your spot and everything that falls apart. Don't be salty. It's not like it was the amen out of you. No, I know. I don't care. Well, I would care. But I wouldn't be too personal about for more than a few moments. All right. Two shots. Then do it. We got a few kills there. All right, guys. Now we're going to move in. Let's, uh, let's tighten the circle up. Not too close. Ah. Come on down. Come on down. Buddy, we're making a new, there we go. There we go. Yeah, this is looking good. This is looking pretty good. All right, here we go, guys. I'm going to go first. Let me get this kill. And you're dead. By the way, it's back to one shot. Yep, go ahead, man. Oh my god. Jules. Roast piece, Jules. It's like you can't catch a break today, man. I know. I'll tell you. Some days, top mountain. Again today. Peyton. Now what? One hell of a scream there. All right, let's increase the two shots. Here we go. If someone gets two kills from like a kill from each bullet shot, that doesn't count. Oh my god. Look, look, that's on you. That obviously wasn't very circular. All right, simply up next. But if you can get one kill, at least one kill with each shot, I'll give everyone a shot watching live, a million Swift bucks. That might be harder to do now. I feel like I'm set up for a goddamn collateral of ear. Man. All right, here we go. Keep on going. Don't move from your spot. C.C. still going strong? That's five of us left, huh? All right. Keep on going. Two shots remain. Next. All right. We're going to reset back to one shot. We're going to move it in closer. So let's go a little bit closer, guys. Try to think it was an equal spot in the smile we could go to, but it's kind of a pain to move around high sensitivity. So let's see. This game is the first time in a long time. I took the self-ish approach of going first. So let's see what it goes. All right, like I said, back down to one shot. Wish you luck. Oh, what else, folks? Yeah, man. I'm surprised no one died yet. What? No. Yes. It was bound to happen. It was bound to happen. Hang on, guys. Hang on. I need to position myself. There we go. All right. You guys can continue now. I got a good angle. Free camera. Free cam is nice. Every call of duty game needs free cam, but not every game gets it. Man, without me, it's just a square. It's not even a circle anymore. Go ahead, man. Yeah. You. Whoever you are. All right, stop. Hang on, buddy. All right, we have four players. It might be a level four guys to each other. We could have you guys move in. Or hang on, let me shot you, guys. We got 11, 25. Walk around, guys. Pick up some ammo, especially UCC. Got to be spinning around, do you pick up, right? No. That might be another perk or something. All right. That's fun. Go back, make a square. Yeah. There we go. I need you guys to all spin. Keep on spinning. I want to give you the world you're going to keep on firing until there's only two people left. I'll let you know when to stop. I'll be based off of two deaths you stop. All right, keep on firing. Start now. Go. Come on, firing. Keep on going. Stop. Zero and CC didn't make it. It's Kilo's and Sinflo remaining. Waitio, guys. You did it. Last two standing. Keep on heading up the center lane over here. Go past the trolley. We're going to do it down over here. Yeah, over here's a good spot. This is good. Right along that track. Perfect. Cool. So you guys know how this works, right? You shake hands, you turn around, and walk as slowly as the game will let you. And then, when I say fire, you turn around, and you fire one shot. Just one. You can't jump around, you can't dodge. Here we go. You guys know where your show can. All good. Turn around so you're back to back. No one else to speak, please. I'll be calling the shot. Walk as slowly as the game will let you go. Fire! Wow. There was that was some calibration going on there. I'm like, eh, well, can I get the replay on that one? Let's see. I don't know if I'll be playing the game or not. Look at that blood over there. It's gelatinous. Oh no, it's the, it's the collateral. Let's see what happened here exactly. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh no, it's the, it's the collateral. Let's see what happened here exactly. Oh, that was kind of cool. I like that in slow-bow. Pretty neat. All right. Good game, guys. So we've done shotgun roulette. We've done snapper roulette. What can we do next? We have some ideas. Let me know in the comments. I'll have to look through the weapons and whatnot. But we can figure something out. Too bad unfortunately I can't give everyone like Moltoffs. Can I? Maybe I can. Anyway, I had an idea. Okay. Well, we'll try it next time. All right. Good game, guys. GG. GG. Dudes, as always, thank you for watching my videos. It really means a lot.
