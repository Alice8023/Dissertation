 What is up, everyone? Welcome to our annual Super Ball prediction game. Everyone on spec grew. We represent the 49ers winning. Everyone on core attack will be representing the Chiefs winning. All right, players will take turns spinning around in a circle. Biring shots. They can only harm people on the other team. All right, let's choose who's going to go first. Randomly, it's going to be... Who's this? Evil Jimmy. Evil Jimmy will be going first. We'll go clockwise from there. All right, people Jimmy's staying in the current place. Spin around in a circle. High speed. Lower shot. Then you can stop spinning. Bushing. Rest the piece. Orange bandit. All right, be skinned in your next. All right, I can only see my teammates. So if you want to announce who you are, go ahead. Those are Jimmy's winners. Those fans, Steve Mayer. I... Thank you. Oh, I need at least you got the plan like bandit. Both will talk.

I will let you guys don't move in. So far, 49ers are have the advantage, but it's still early game. Calculating. Oh, this is not looking very good for that one. That was much. That was much. That was much more targeting the chiefs. If you were spinning super slow together, if they unless they kill camp shows, it's my turn. My turn. Now you die. You just ruined it. You had your chance, but you ruined it. Go your back. Oh, geez. Oh, that's something. Oh, recipes attacker. There we go. Don't worry. There are more. There we go. Nice shot. Impostor attackers. Reloading. We all know that was the real attacker. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. All right. Evil Jimmy next team on. Is that you, will Jimmy? Yeah. Yeah. Everyone. Yeah. Look at a person on your left.

Let's go home, Lander. Oh, I'm so proud of you. I'm so proud of you. All right, use your catch-and-up. I'm going to kill me if you didn't point at me. Your weapons are useless again.
