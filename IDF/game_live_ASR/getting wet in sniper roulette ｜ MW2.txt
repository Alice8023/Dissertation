Here we go. Unmoving. Stop diving bro. Next. Oh that sounds like a zombie down to the shot. Back. Oh that was close. I like the waves that make some noise. Oh Corey, rest of the piece. That's the pressure to blame. Keep it going. All right. I'm going some on. Oh Mr. Banana guy. Rest the piece man. Next. Is this even a circle? No. It's a little more. I want the better. I want the better camera view. If I die I get the ultimate camera view. I almost got died. I almost died. Oh. Of course with the moment I feel better. Go figure. Next. Oh now be where I die and let's go. Out close. The water physics are gorgeous though. Wait. That's okay. I wanted that. Hang on. Just wait guys. Someone else died. Yeah dude. So as a general thumb while I'm dead you got a chill. I need to come back. Inspect. All right. Who died? Labby. Oh, that wasn't me. All right. Let's continue. Oh no. Oh my god. Love that body is there. Wait. Sorry. I'm dead. I didn't tell you to stop. You're good. Go ahead. GG. That's all right. I'm killing someone for real this time. I don't know if I'm going to die. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. That was a silly minute. That was funny to say. It was a rough catch. You can't hit. I mean. Yeah. You can't hit. You can't hit. It looks like underwater. Pretty cool. Oh, no. There's a lot of dead bodies. This is how it looks like. Stand up. Let's just start. Oh, you said he's watching. All right. It's for real this time. There's a ton. Maybe third time stop the charm. Yeah. Kill that wall. Oh my god. We've not yet known. Ouch. Should we turn it up? We're good for now. People are still telling me when they die. When they die, what do you think? We're good. The view underwater is definitely better than above the water. I know what I'm doing. I'm scared. All right. This is really scary. This is scary. This is scary. This is scary. This is scary. It's the most funny underwater when they're spinning around. The lights just do that. All right. Wait. We're moving a little bit closer. Let's make a smaller circle here. Come on. This is scary. It's a little bit right. All right. I got some bonus round. Bonus round. Everyone to spin. It's been full speed. Come on. Oh no. Come on. Come on. Watch out. No! Oh. Oh. Oh. It's all I put in deep. Well. You're the only one that can do that. It looks very dramatic. I'll give you that. All right. Let's continue. Two-streamer, two-streamer. Two-streamer. Next. Two-streamer. Two-streamer. Two-streamer. Two-next. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Oh. Ruse of these ghosts. Next. Seven times the charm. Oh. You got them. Oh. Finally. Has the lucky one. Oh man. Oh god. Someone has. Final five. There it is. Rest in peace. I got it. I'm going to kill someone every single time. You can maybe not. Go. Go. You're a boss. Oh god. Rest in peace. All right. Three left. Seven times the charm. Oh god. Oh god. All right. Three left. Seven times the charm. Oh god. Oh god. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, bro, bro. Oh god. He's all good. He's all right. All right. All right. Two remaining players. We got Sandman and rats. Do you guys... How do we guys consider yourselves bad? I call it duty. I mean, good enough. I am like... I don't... I don't think whatever we do. I think I care. He can be. Oh god. It's two people. There it is. Whatever again. All right, folks. I want you guys to spread out in this area over here. I want you to see some distance. It'll be a 1v1 sniper belt. The difference is... You must completely submerge your body. The fire of one shot. Then you must come up for air. And then dive again to fire another shot. So it's one shot per dive. Makes sense? You guys can wiggle around. So. Are you diving to water? You can fire on one shot. If you want to fire a second shot, you must come back up for air. Then dive again. Get it? Yeah. All right, great. Weeding scopes? Whatever you want. When you're under water, you want to go for it. But I obviously don't want to self-aggress underwater. That would be a very embarrassing. All right. Ready? Set. Go. This is very anti-crime. Yeah, I don't think you can shoot on water. Wait, get fired. I only have pistol scat. Wait, you can't fire us that far into water? No. All right, we're back up again. Back up again. Back up again. All right, all right. That's a very important detail that clearly I do not consider. All right, so we're going to do very simple rules. Uh, we need some, same principle. You can fire a shot when you're above water, but to fire another shot, you must completely submerge yourself, then come back up. All right, so back up again. All right, both players will start submerge for this one. Submerge? Dive? Sort of says go. That's what it says. There we go. Okay, this makes a bit more sense. You're going to have to fire into the water most likely, right? Well, this is actually pretty cool. Waiting. He's talking to me. Oh, good try. Good try. All right, the rats win that one. You two. Yeah, rats. You rats the one. The skills will take it. JG said man, get sport right there. Oh, that was kind of cool. That was fun. I got a chip. I didn't like it. What is that? He weighed it. Bro, dude, I'm like thermal skill. What the hell that was? Wow. I don't care. He won fair and square. It's just for fun, guys. I don't think we'll see this mode in the CDL in time soon. All right, GG guys. That's a good one. That's a good one. You just lost game.
