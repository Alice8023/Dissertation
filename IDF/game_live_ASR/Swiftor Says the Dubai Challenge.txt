 What is up everyone? Season three. I think the swifter says we're gonna do by right now. This map was called what? Six star. Ah, and this is a nice hotel probably can never afford it. All right, swifter says turn around. Walked one big step in that direction you would not be coming back. But there are some places where you can jump and come back. So it's come with me. We're gonna keep this off with a challenge. So it says follow me. All right. Number don't take any risks. No unnecessary risk was part of the challenge. All right, this way for remember exactly where I was. The nice map. Oh, I know. It's about to be out of bounds, isn't it? That's usually a good spot for a challenge. Oh, hey, you're never being here in the last map or in the last game. Yeah, I do. Say a lot of defense modes. My legs. Going to do a tour right now until I actually play in the challenge. You just did a complete circle around the entire map. Let's go. I'll know what I see it. Oh, this is it right here. Perfect. Why can't I look great? All right, so just come on. We're gonna come on over over there. There's like a white little barrier. You can jump on that and then jump back. So don't do it yet. So it says everyone back up. I'm gonna demonstrate for you how it's done. When I say me, I mean stupid. It's stupid. Come on over, man. It looks stupid. This is a very skill player. He was able to stream snap me and murder me during my sponsor stream. That was very important to me. All right. Look, all you got to do stupid is there's no more warfers by the way. Let's get the live a little bit longer. Jump out of that white barrier and then come back alive. There's plenty of time. Swiftress says good luck stupid. Can I get some space though? No, I'm gonna use space. You take up to my space. It's spreading your man's bro. You got my space. Okay, I see. All right. Good job. Look at that. It's about 0.01. Lending a time. Swiftress says, let's show or someone else we give them that a shot. We're not leaving her until someone gives me a hilarious death from this. A snoop dog actually a dog. He's got that. He's got that. I thought you were kidding. It's the black cell version. Oh, I thought this was a attacker. I would wait. Sorry. Swiftress says first person crouch tries it. Swiftress says come on over seep you Mac. And it's volunteering. You know what he's getting himself into. Same deal. Good luck. Which is go ahead. Oh, no. All right, let's try that again. Last person jump tries it. Through to says all three of you that jump come on down and insane. Swiftress says what I swear I heard you say it as crazy. Maybe you know, you know, J. You got imaginary Swiftress. I believe in you. All right. Just J. You have a lot of practice before the game started falling off. So how about you give it go first man? That's crazy. Like just jump on there and jump back. Oh, my god. Damn it. No. You got this welcome. You got to wait. Swiftress is vaped. You're a thing. You make my money worth it, bro. I hope you fucking follow. Oh, he's very dead. I have a soul. All right. Just born a look man. At least I landed on fucking legs. All you got is jump on there and jump back. Man, you can do it. Swiftress says go ahead. White ledge. Now jump back. Oh, I'm a bad sport. Okay. Dead for the rest of the game. Let's go. Swiftress says I'm not going to try and trick you guys anymore. Listen. Swiftress says the first person, the crouch, when I give the word, we'll get through the challenge. If they do the challenge, I will do the challenge. If I, and hang on, doesn't end there. And if I die from doing the challenge after you survived, I'm going to hit you again. I'm going to hit you again. I'm going to hit you again. I'm going to die from doing the challenge after you survived. You then run the rest of the game. Or you can give it to somebody else. Whoa. Through the road. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Oh, now he says that. I should have waited. Did you deliver dice, sir? Exactly. All right. You got to survive your challenge for it to be you. All right. Swiftress says go. All right. Hang on. I saw the first person I saw was. Deadwood. So does that one? If you do it, and then I fail, it's your game. So you're going to about the block me and get me killed. I think that's the one. You got the deadwood. Come on, deadwood. Oh, my turn. I had point one second left. No joke. No joke. I'm blowing on you. I'm blowing on you. I hope you make it. It's about to be a deadwood. Says if I screw this up. For the third time. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Point six seconds. Sorry, man. It's OK. I'll let someone else challenge me. It's fine. Now we can do that wood. All right. I had point six seconds left. I did a pretty good job there. I'm going to pat myself in the back. But that could have been a free. He did better than me. All right. If you would also like to challenge me, crouch now. I want to show the challenge me a good job. Swiftress says follow me. Wow. I got first. I didn't get it. Swiftress was probably the new he was really good at. I practiced a little bit before the stream. But at the beginning of the stream, I practiced a little bit. Hey, at least I looked like S.M. I said this was easy and then died. Swiftress says we're on top of here, please. Hey, Suizo. Welcome. Welcome, guys. Wait, was that the first one that now? Was the first one that died? No. It was me. It was me. See, give it a shot. Great. All right. Swiftress says stand on the outside edge of that circle by dropping into the water. So if you drop into the water, you die. Don't push me. Swiftress says must die. Come on. Don't push me. I'm going to die. Don't push me. I'm going to die. I'm not going to die. I'm not going to die. Actually, I'm going to die. Swiftress says. Look at any sky. I'm going to die. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Slaf effect to this scoop. See, that was sick. That's another way to it to 52's able to go, . soy harmful to make a splash. We'll also get into one way trip. Wait until I say go. Ready set. Go! Yeah, it's a good switch. Let's go. Why would you jump? Yeah, switch is just please go with me. Is this new moon?

Switch says everyone aim at a pain of glass. Switch says after I say fire you cannot fire any other glass. If there's any pain in glass that is not destroyed, there will be a punishment. Do your very best to guess which pain of glass not being pointed at by anyone else. To be based on everybody's point of view, I can do a little scan here. All right. Switch says lock in your pain of glass. Switch says unload. Oh, oh. Switch says freeze. I see a lot of glass. No good. No good. Half of you are dying. I couldn't see it from where I was.

So if the says lap shoulder to shoulder. Wow, that a lot of you got down quick. It's only 24 people. Say it more. All right. For this one. Which is that's why I say the name of the country this map takes place in. Who will crouch last two people to crouch will perform this challenge. North America. Asia. The Middle East. Saudi Arabia. United Arab Emirates. I'm pretty sure that's correct. Anyway, it is. It is. It is. United Arab Emirates. All right. So it is Banna. Ted, you guys we played a special game. To what just says there are two starting points. This corner over here. And right over here. Just a look. To what is the guy? Let's see over here. And what? By this plan over. It'll be the other one. All right. Switches is both of you guys. Go ahead and choose one of those points to stand on. They should be equally distant to this corner over here. They actually don't get deleted. All right. The rest of you guys over here. Switches says if they fall off towards us, you kill them. One of this many game with a person who gets to that corner first without falling off. So the game begins when I fire my gun. It's over. Banna. Banna. I was dying. I mean to be fair, I think he was closer. I think Banna was closer. Yeah, I went up and spectacular. I'm going to look down and he just looks slightly closer. Okay. It's time for measurements. Switches is both of you guys. Stand over here. We're going to do some measurements. Switches is all of you guys. Starting from this plant, going to prone on the wall. We're going to measure. Yep. Go ahead. Careful now. What are we doing? It's all. I feel a little dangerous now.

Shoulders then don't back up, man. Okay. Martini, why are you crawling towards him? What are you doing? I thought we were measuring the links from that of the... No, the other side from the core. It's fine. So, Martini, back up. Okay. Yeah. All right. It's like a half. Almost like... Actually, almost a full bi-length longer. You're right. That was unfair and said. No problem. I have a more fair game. Switches is U4. Good job measuring. Take your way off. All right. We got a more fair mini-game. You two kill each other. Switches says U6 follow me. No penalty for that one.
