Yes Swiftress says get ready Swiftress says get ready So let's go on the smoke So let's go on the smoke Good luck What does this freeze? Alright first person to move Guys remember once one person moves Get out of the way Oh no I'm big Lucky well that's awkward Congratulations you three Damn Alright you know what three of you guys three loadouts Swiftress says everyone each of you stand on your own loadout drops So let's get on top Swiftress says clean your loadout Great Swiftress says the lap's shoulder Let's find out what you got First I want to hear your name What you got Supernax and I got a motor strike It's Odin and I've got a cluster mine Black Mamba and I got a Wilson Oh that is fun That is fun Alright Let me think about this for a moment Is there a way I can have you guys do a 1-D1-V1 Only using those I feel like You say no Over here man we make impossible Possible or at least we make the impossible Very funny at your expense Alright so Let's see Foxymini mine Luster mine Wilson Yeah I think you can do this Look all of you guys are very smart Swiftress says once again you are stuck Inside of this pool Swiftress says get some distance from each other Let me think this out in my mind Imagine for a moment if I were to force you to use Your kill streak Whatever it is to Kill the other two players How would you do it Thinking about the other two guys have What would you do? How do you counter this I'm trying to put myself in the shoes of every player What I would do It's a little tricky In fact it's so tricky Me being over here is a hazard to my health Don't it's Joven please meet your microphone In fact hang on Swiftress says all of you guys point you good at my feet Fire Swiftress says kill Odin You failed and then say Swiftress says Now it's the 1v1 It is what the Wilson The The Motor Strike Yeah I lose I lose I'm either killed myself with the motor strike I will just run me over Do I have to explain your kill streak to you man No I know my motor strike is It's no use You can tell him what they can get Move dummy Yeah but the wheel stick can fire without it moving That guy is going to kill me before the motor strike We are looking for my shot I have to say in the water that's the rules Here I will make the rules a little bit more fair Understand the motor strike Motor Strike doesn't kill everyone in the map right It only kills someone in a zone If you point your motor strike In a far enough distance it will hurt the other player And not you Now, Mama here are your rules Your rule is that you Can only run him over You cannot fire your Wilson toward And Those are the rules You can do this This is very winnable by your super knocks You just have to estimate how Mama will be in the zone and you won't I'm happy to spell it out I got to pull a horse out of my ass Exactly too high If you want to change your spot super knocks you can't So it's going to change your spot Maybe the other side I'm not allowed to move if she is using the list You can move Your job is not going to be run over While you hope that your motor strike doesn't kill both of you Alright Swiftress says go You fired it way too close You're dead Run him over You literally aimed in the center of your area Did you not? I just wanted to kill her No, if that's not a word No, I would not You would have heard The motor strike doesn't hit the same spot every time You wanted to set it up It's random If you set it up further in In Mama's direction It would have more likely hit them Anyway Is that a draw? I'm telling you I got the kill I'm telling you I got the kill No, you killed yourself No, no Technically you lost I'll let the viewers decide that one Alright GG, fun one
