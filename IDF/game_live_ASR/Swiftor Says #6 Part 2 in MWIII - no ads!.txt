 Game I appreciate it. What's going to stop? All right, we have four players up here. So I have to be a little honest guys. You four, I said I'd let you guys kill a lot of people under there. It's kind of, it was a possibility. The other possibility is that you guys have to survive the shot coming from below from where one down there. What will happen? You know what? You're going to use a vote. All right, there's a poll on the screen. Everyone watching live on TikTok, Twitch, YouTube, have a buffer below. We'll be the ones firing the shots. If below wins the last person survive at the top. Yeager. Come on down, Yeager. Get underneath there with us. Come on down. Yeager. I jumped in the game. What? Yep, yep, yep. Let's go down down there. Yeager, I did nothing to you. Yeager. Yeager. Yeager. Beautiful before the game. Yeager. Yes, I did. Yeager. Go to the river, not into the bridge. Ooh, you're the best. I forgot me a sandwich. Yeager, be a good little troll and show with us. Daily, damn mealy button being right next to my freaking jump button. Yeah, I was looking away. Yeager, you have to go into further in the river. I'm out, Yeager. Further in the river. Yeah, right there is good. You can stop now. Unload. All right, hang on. Who did you kill? You killed boss? Yeah. Yeah, boss man. Poor boss man. All right, so people have voted. Folks from below. We'll be firing. Well, let's see. Should we let boss man come back? Yes. Yes. Oh, that's very, that's no, no, no, I'm asking you guys. I'm asking check. All right, guys, don't revive for yes. We're going to bring boss man back. Type net to let, to let you know boss man be dead. Look at that. Wow, people are getting some revive. Yeah, type revive and shot. This vote works in all platforms. Another shot to ABD for for making a great cross platform pulling system. Don't we should we should change the color of the names so people kind of know where they're voting from. All right, boss man, come back. People have chosen to bring you back. Was there another act of violence down there? I don't know. I'm going to kill people. Yes, price comes up. Price killed somebody. Yeah, price. Can you go check on Yager's body, please? Check for a price. I saw that. I saw it. Yeah, yeah, price. Go check on the body over here, man. Walk out, bro. Price walk out to the river, man. I need to do a double check for me. There we go. You just take a look. Can you can you find the body? Unload. All right. It's time. Inside for the final mini game. This is taking a while. All right. So once again, players from below will be firing above you guys need to survive without getting off the bridge. Now this game would be over instantly if these guys could just unload above. So to fix that, players will only fire a one bullet when I give the word. So if it says if you're below the bridge, people fire a one bullet every time I say the word banana. Swift up. Yes, what about shotguns? It's fine. There's no as long as you're not using an RPG or grenade launcher, you're fine. All right. Swift just listen carefully. Remember only one shy every time I see the B word. Banana. Wow. More than one. OK. I would like to know the name of the last corpse of fall over here. Who is this? Oh, it's over. Ruby. Ruby. Ruby won the game. Congratulations. What's your shout out? You know what true. Wow. Ruby. Ruby what's your shout out? So it's just killing shot. That is incredibly nice. You're the man. Thank you very much. So GG guys.
