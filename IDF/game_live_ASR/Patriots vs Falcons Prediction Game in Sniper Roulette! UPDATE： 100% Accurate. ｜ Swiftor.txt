 Make sure you tap the bell so you never miss a video. It's right next to the sub button. Thanks guys. What is up, Unibros, as it has become a yearly tradition, we're gonna do a Super Bowl prediction here in Mortal Mode, in Call of Duty. So, we're doing this one in Black Ops one. We've got, let's see, we've got Teen Patriots right here, and we've got Teen Falcons right over there. So in Mortal Mode, or a case, Nepper will let, players will be spinning around, firing a shot at random. You may end up getting collaterals. There will mostly be collaterals, but last team alive wins. All right, so, let's see what your team goes for. I'm gonna spin around in a circle, close my eyes, and, oh, there you go. All right, Teen Patriots is going first. To even it out, I'll be on Teen Patriots. All right, we're gonna kick it off with, Marcus. All right, Marcus, spin around, fire shot, bro. All right, great. Next up, it's Virginia Zone, go for it. Did you fire your shot? I thought you just reloaded on my screen. Anyone else here in the shoot? No, I didn't. Nah, did you got, yeah, spin around, and fire gun, not reload. There you go. All right, person next to Marcus. Sloth. Sloth, go for it, bro. All right, next, person next to Virginia. There you go. You guys have been a feeling for the order now, so just go ahead. Oh, collateral, Swift HD out. All right, next. Wait, was that my teammate? Yes, you killed your teammate. It happens, bro. Next, whoever was next to Swift HD, go ahead. Bro, help me out here. It's a rocket station. Oh, sorry. All right, next, Falcon's team. Oh, go. Go. Ha, ha. You look alike. All right, remember guys, stay in your positions. There's no crouching. Got to reign standing up the entire time. All right, whoever's next to the car, I'll go over here, you go. There's a guy right next to me. All right, this work. Thank God. All right, no problem. It's better for me because I can just go ahead and, don't far yet. I can just do a good spectator over here. All right, go ahead. All right, team Patriots. All right, we got to reset there. Marcus, you're up. Good job, human track, if you're supposed to go. That was close. Oh, there we go. Finally, hit on the other team. Almost makes up for you murdering your teammate. Oh, yeah. Old close shot there. Well, Marcus, it wasn't your turn. Oh, sorry. Zerp is out. Next. We're going to skip Marcus when it's his turn. All right. Hang on. You have to go ahead next on team Falcons. All right, skip. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Marcus gets skipped. Next person on team Falcons, go ahead. You second man. Sloth. Not sloth. Not sloth. Is that sloth? I don't get names. I don't get my names this mode. Call them out for me, boys. Person next to Virginia. All right, good. Now the person next to Marcus, go ahead. There we go. Great, go ahead. God damn it, Jeff. Leave me alone. There we go, buddy. There we go. Continue on. Oh, rocket stations out. The bullet. Be a collateral. Marcus, you're up. What the hell? Oh, Marcus out. Samtels, grenade exploding. My ghost is attracts people. Spullets. Oh, dragon hunter with a shot. Nicely done. Marcus. Don't worry, even though it looks grim, this game mode always has the ability to kind of like even it out. Go on. Pops. Who is this guy next to Virginia? There we go. Oh, yep. Third man. No jumping allowed. Sorry. No fun allowed in my games. Pops, it's back to you. Yes. There we go. Feel free to call out their name when it's their turn, guess. Helps me out. I don't get names on unspectator unless you go in a first person. I'd prefer to keep this view. Tlaw. You went too quickly over there. Maybe not. Person in the middle on team Falcons. There you go. Cover me. I'm reloading. There we go. If we don't get a kill in the next rotation, we're going to go ahead and move teams close to each other. Oh, sloth the man down. Oh, my teammate. Oh, no. Yep. Good job. All right. So it's 4B3 right now. Stop. All right. I like everyone to move up to the few steps. I don't want you guys super close to each other, but you should be like, you know, 25% in from your side. Make sure you're to line up shoulder to shoulder, space, down, adequately. The three guys should be, yeah, not so close to each other. You're a shoulder to shoulder. Move out. Move a little bit to your left, bro. There you go. That's good. Good job. Great. And let us, you know, let's kick it off with a bonus round. I want everyone to spin. Oh, no. And when I yell fire, you're going to fire a single bullet and that's it. So everyone's spin. Fire! Oh, yeah. I didn't go well. All right. No team back in, bro. You stay up there. All right. Verse four. Now, he's your own teammate. He's also a falcon's vet. Why would you do that to him? All right. Hey, hey, hey, hey. That's enough. Folks in the game. All right. It's four of you two right now. Let's continue. I figure out where we were. So I guess we'll just start off with. I want the person on team falcons number one. Go first. All right. What the fuck? What was that? Hang on. Hang on. Skip. What the fuck? What was that? Hang on. Hang on. Skip. Skip Patriots. Stop. Stop. Go bounce up and down. There we go. You go ahead number one on what's was that spinning right now? There we go. Yeah. We need some order here, boys. Stop one second. You guys are going out of order here. Yeah. I'm going to go back. I'm going to go back. Okay. I'm going to go back. I'm going to go back. Okay. I'm going to go back. Okay. I'm going to go back. Okay. I'm going to go back. I'm going to go back. Okay. I'm going to go back. Okay. So where's the other person that is going out of order here? You guys going out of order? All right. Let's see here. Oh, I can look... I'll go close enough. I can see where you are. Great. All right. Who's next? I think it's... Let me see here on this team. It's dragon hunter. And splash. And over here we've got... Let's see here. Antonic. Yeah. Cardock. We've got midget. We got Billy. There a card lock. All right. Dragon go for it. All right. Splash. Dragon. Dragon. Oh, next Billy. All right. 3v2. It's evening out. So when? All right splash. Oh Woo. We who we all right. All right. 2v2. Go ahead and continue. Remember to stay in your spot. Don't move around. Who are they? Hang on. Hang on. It's it's mid. It's turn. Dragon. I'm out. Wait, wait, splash. Not your turn. Card lock. It's your turn. Oh, no. Tyler. 13 months. Splash. Go for it. Keep your spot, man. Don't move. All right. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. What's there? Well, basically hang us. It's it's simple. It's simple. It's me. You guys take your turns. Card lock goes. Then dragon goes. Card lock goes. Then splash goes. Card lock goes. Then dragon goes. Got it. All right. Continue. Card lock goes. Dragon goes. Drug card goes. Splash goes. Card lock goes. Dragon goes. You guys got it. Yeah. This church. Yeah. All right. You'd be fine. Remember guys get a few spins in. Not trick-shotting. I mean, you kind of are, but. There you go. Get a few spins in before you fire. All right, guys. Hold on. What are I will count that? I can't see. I got three bullets and that's all I have. All right. Do a little scavenging, guys. See if you can. Nothing? I'm good. I'm good on ammo. No problem. All right, guys. I need all three of you to move a little bit closer. I want card lock to do it for the packers. All right. I got you. Avenge the pack. All right. So I think card lock was up next. Continue. Proven the birds. All right. Splash. You're ready. Gross. He gets two girls. One time card lock. Card lock again. Again. All right. Yep, because dragon. Oh! Come on. Yes. Dragon had gone right after splash. I could be mistaken. I make mistakes. But gentlemen, it's funny how these things work out. Games always get equalized. So gentlemen, this duel will decide the predictions this game makes. Card lock representing the Patriots. Splash representing the Falcons. What we're going to do now is a duel. Now you guys, now we're very, very rule conscious, especially about this duel. So let me explain this perfectly to you guys. You guys will mean the middle. Yep. You're going to shake hands. Good sportsmanship and all that. Then you're going to turn around when I give you the words that you're back to back. You're not actually doing it yet, guys. I'm just kind of giving a tutorial now. Then, no, you can turn around. It's tutorial. Don't actually fire gun, though. Then I'm going to ask you to walk as slowly as the game will let you. So, to practice, walk as slowly as the game will let you. Good. Then everyone remains completely quiet. Then I'll yell fire. You'll turn around. All right. You'll turn around. You can't jump out of the way. You can't go into prone. You can't jump. You can't strafe side to side. You literally turn around and you take one shot. You miss your shot. You wait. If both of you miss your shot, we do one redo. If we miss both, both the required three do's, then we'll all this one else. I'm a little bit surprised. So, this is it, guys. Wait, I have a question. Can we aim or no? You can aim. Yeah, sure. But aim is going to take you time, right? So, I mean, with Slape Royals, we'll suggest you aim unless, you know, it's up to you. Yes. You can aim. Your sense to be must remain at maximum, though. If you change your sense to be setting, you turn back on your auto aim, that is cheating. Can both of you guys confirm with a nod that you keep in your settings exactly as is? Well, that looks a little weird. All right. Turn back. All right. All right, guys. All right, guys. Let's begin once more time. We're doing for real. Please shake hands. All right. Turn around so you're back to back. Walk as slowly as the game will let you. Fire! No, you had the shot, Raul Kornak. You had the free shot. I was just kidding. I was just kidding. I thought it was an- It's over. He's got it. And then it misses. I rushed. No. You did, man. Dude, it's- You get caught up in the moment. You get caught up in the moment. I've been there. I've been there. Believe it or not. All right, guys. All right. Back to hand-shaking position. I could have been it. I could have been it for the felcons. They could have had it. All right. That's okay, guys. All right. Walk as slowly as the game will let you. Fire! Oh! And there you have it. Our-our-our-our mortal mode prediction for 2017 is the Patriots. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's nice. We'll see what really happens. All right. Good game, guys. Good game. GG, boys. GG. GG. GG.
