Tion says he's gonna give you opportunity to change the order you are in the line based on how confident you are you're gonna win. Tion says if you feel most confident come to the diving board end and Tion says if you feel least confident you're gonna win go to the other end. Tion says you have 30 seconds and obviously must be lined up shoulder to shoulder at the end of this. Yeah that board is very shoulder to shoulder guys. Look guys it's a shoulder to shoulder. Tion says shoulder to shoulder. This board is not shoulder to shoulder. Dianne is Syrian. Stupid come on. I'm so confused on it. Hey thanks for telling us the rules man.

Yes, yeah everyone. Jans says everyone's going out to the back pool again. You should side-forward, right? The people are the fans. Where we spotted. Jans says we're going for a bit of swimming in. So everyone stand behind the diving board. It's a shame this isn't like the one in Cold War where you could springboard. It's pretty shame. Yeah. I missed that. Yeah, Jans says everyone light up my dive mode. So Jans says you're all going to get one at a time. You're all going to get one shot to dive, dolphin dive from the board into the pool.

He's just staring back at you. So, Tiana says, take out the weapon you feel will do the best bullet damage. Tiana says, keep shovel with melee. Nice. Well done. You've learned. You've learned the early people's mistakes. Tiana says, everyone follow me. I would have shot. I was about to. That's why he has to shoot it. Tiana says, get on high as high as high as I can. Tiana says, the person that's highest stop. He's a nice reward. Hey, I'm trying. No, stop pushing me off. Tiana says, don't forget you've got to be up the highest. So, people on the bottom, you just push me off. That's great. I'm absolutely going to try and push you off. Also, Tiana says, there's a few other potmen who are in the most danger as well, just you know. That is the highest. Tiana says, three, two, one. Tiana says, freeze. I'm going to have to go up the highest. Tiana says, stupid. Tiana says, come on down. Yeah, push off. Tiana says, let's do it out. Yeah. I still can't get out. You still can't get out. You still can't get out. Let him out, buddy. Tiana says, you with a lowest down. Tiana says, you coming out. Tiana says, what's your name? Amy. Amy. I can do it. Tiana says, everyone, Amy. Amy. Buddy. What the hell? How did you push off again? I missed. I didn't even try to aim with a kick. I didn't even try to do anything. You don't do anything. You don't aim with the Kimbo's, buddy. Tiana says, everyone aim with Amy. Fire. Swift says fire. Tiana says, jump once. Tiana says, fire at Amy. Tiana says, everyone, come on down and line up shoulder to shoulder. Tiana says, everyone. Tiana says, he wants one volunteer, potentially. And you may survive. You may not. If you do survive, you'll have to get immunity for the next couple of instructions. Tiana says, if you feel like you stand at, so I'm going to let you know what it's going to be. So this car explodes. However, I don't know how many bullets it takes. If you're still on top of here, Tiana says, everyone else is going to fire one bullet at the truck. And it might explode. It might not. Obviously, if you survive, then you've got immunity for the next couple of instructions. If you die, you're dead. I'm going to just let's say Tiana says, if you want to be a volunteer, Tiana says crouch. Oh, wow. Got a couple of volunteers. Tiana says, you three, coming up. Two rats on the cowboy. They know something we don't. Obviously, I only want one volunteer. Tiana says, Tiana says, last person's crouched volunteer. Wow. Wow. Tiana says, right in the middle, what's your name? Braks. Supernarks. Take your place on top of this. Nice. Nice. Yeah. Uh oh. Tiana says, everyone else stand back. Tiana didn't say, but I guess it's fine. So Tiana says, line up shoulders shoulder along here. And then one at a time, Tiana says, I'll bring you down to fire your one bullet. Man. So Tiana says, start you. Tiana says, come on down. Hey, oh, Starlight shoulder. Hey, there you go. You miss nine. Tiana says, we'll start with you. Tiana says, obviously, if you want to go close to fire with it can, but fire one bullet at a truck, Tiana says. Good. Tiana says, next. Tiana says, next. Yep. Tiana says, next. And yep, next. Tiana says, fire one bullet at a truck. It's you, Starlight. Tiana says, if you need to, if you need to move to get a better line, you can. Um, obviously at the end, you might not see it. Tiana says, next. Uh oh. Tiana says, next. Here. Tiana says, next. More. And yep, finally. Ah. Very good. You chose well. Tiana says, you super knocks can go and stand on the stairs over here. You're safe. But now, however, we all want to see the truck blow up really. The vehicle. Tiana says, last person to crouch will go on the truck. Well, I don't know. Most, I think it was you. Tiana says, you can stand up on to the. Tiana says, every name at the truck. Tiana says, fire one bullet at a truck. Tiana says, fire one bullet. Let your people. Bye bye. Bye, man. Bye, man. Bye, man. Bye, man. I was not last. I was not last. This body. I tried to help my view. Oh, it's nice. It's the one moment. Tiana, I've disconnected. I'll be right back one moment. All right. Stream go crazy. All right. Back in. Go for it, Tiana. Tiana says, everyone follow me over to the pool. We've got someone who needs to learn a bit of a lesson on that. Something. Oh, please let me do that, Tiana. Sure. Let me do the. I'm sure finally. I want to know what the lay down finisher looks like. Tiana says, rain mass. Please enter the water. You say you went to grab some water. Here's a plenty of water. Tiana says, rain mass enter the water. Yeah. I know. I know. He's got a lot of things. Ah. Tiana says, you get. Tiana says you get a chance to live. Don't worry. You're not instantly dead because you get a chance. Tiana says, you can swim anywhere in this pool you want to. Tiana says, when I give the word, everyone else will be able to take one shot at you. And obviously if you live, then you live. Tiana says, everyone, when you're ready, Tiana says, fire one bullet at him. Dance. You just need to get out of here. You start him over there. That's on here. Don't do it. And now you've got plenty of water. Tiana says, you bring back in. Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I see this click. I show you the game. Is this a walk away? It'll pull like you by the get baptized. Is this over here? Oh, god. I think I'm sorry, Dave, but I don't know who. Oh. Tiana says, which dude where this crashed? Now that it was it was the guy that you gave immunity to from the fountain. Oh, yeah. That's fine. Tiana says, get as high as you can on this, this, uh, fountain statue. Tiana says, to bottom three people may die. Tiana says, you have five seconds, five, four, three, two, one. Tiana says freeze. So the lowest three people, Tiana, excuse me, buddy. My hands. They've been. Hey, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, freeze. Down to it. Down, set, freeze. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Well, I think that game. Yeah, that's just. Oh, that was well. Uh, I was wondering who they were. That's what it was. It's not any good at Swift. It says we've learned that apparently. Tiana says you and Tiana says you and Tiana says. I see you before you. Tiana says. Uh, super. Wait, Tiana says super knocked jump. He's, he's right there. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You're obviously safe from the banners, but Tiana says other rats come on down. I fell off. Tiana says all three of you stand by the diving board. Bringing back a good old classic from the last one. Tiana says last person's crouch is definitely dead. Never seen a middle one in the last one. Just what I wanted. Tiana says you in the middle, what's your name? Sure. Sure. Tiana says chill. You're definitely dead and you're going to die by semtex. Tiana says when the semtex hits you, you can choose to run towards either of the other two players. You've a stupid or Tiana says what's your name? The rat. The rubs. Lips. So Tiana says you can even choose to run far away and let them live. Or you can just take them down with you. Tiana says good luck. There goes labs. Oh, there goes the rest of the room next to me, bro. We actually do. We just survive. It's too pitiful to be joined. Tiana says everyone follow me. How did you even die today? Tiana says, hit on top of the piano if you can. You love a good old piano, chewed. What the hell? My aim is just to work crazy. Ah. Ah, I don't expect you would fit up there, actually. Yeah, plenty of room. Er, I think you love that. Tiana says look at one of a person on that piano. Everybody. Tiana says if you got a melee weapon, pull it out. Oh, I was almost aiming with that. That would have been dangerous. That would have been. Melae, the person you're looking at. What the heck? I don't want to leave an melee. Well, I don't even know who that was either. I don't expect it. I can't say. I got shot. Tiana says, yeah, if you know who it was. Tiana says if you know who it was. The witch. The witch. Tiana says which one? Which one out? The witch of the west. Tiana says, yeah, come on up. Oh, yeah, there we go. Tiana says what's your name? That's your eager. Tiana says your eager. Do you know what a melee is? Yes. Are you sure? Because I think you did that when you meant to do that. Tiana says everyone follow me. I'm stuck behind the piano. You're stuck behind the piano? No, I was. I was. I was. Oh, you were out. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay. I just want to say if you're stuck back there, that's a problem. No, I wanted to come on. Come on. He's probably going to Tiana says that. Yeah. Hey, can't climb on the wall. That's a shame. Tiana says, I'm going to throw down. Let's not start with that one. Let's start with this one. Tiana says, I'm going to throw down the care package marker and you're going to walk Tiana says you're going to stand on the smoke. Tiana says the first person to move alive will die. But obviously you don't want to get crushed by the care package. Tiana says, stand on the smoke. Sit. Sit. Tiana says, Tiana says, right, come around. Sit. Sanders got up. Tiana says first to move dies. I think I'm good. I think I'm good. I think I'm good. I'm good. It was the. Goal. It was the black, the black and the war. I think it was. I thought it was just. It was. It was. It was. Yeah. This guy. Yes. This guy. What's your name, sir? Yes, it was that guy. What's your name, sir? Swedish chef Tiana says turn around the gun to throw. Okay. Hit pop drop. Bring them. That's. Take that man's man. And cards. I'll be a bit. Is that it? Oh yeah. Is that illegal? Tiana says three of you follow me over to. A final three. No, that's not what I want it. That's not what I don't want that. How do I get out of this? I think I just have to inside. You have to inside. You know you're fine. I can. I can stop. It's a stopper gun or not an attack. Yeah, you're right. Guns says shoot today and destroy it. Please because I didn't. Oh my god. I think it was a weird or whatever. I've lost. I've even reached it. I have nothing that'll reach it. My pulse did not reach it. I wish. I should have told you. Yeah, I've got a shotgun. I didn't mean to do that. I have 12 bullets per magazine. This is not going to go very fast. It's faster. Alex. I can't do anything. I have 12 bullets. I've got critical damage. Will miss that. Yeah, there we go. There we go. Oh, they're going to die. They're almost died. Oh, they're going to die. Wow. That landed really close. My shotgun shot definitely had a lot of one. Tiana says they've won come over this way. On a bit more space. So Tiana says I'm going to throw this down. Do not stand in a smoke. I do not want any of you dying yet. Tiana says just wait for him to drop. Stand clear in a smoke. Yeah, good job. So Tiana says he's going to give you the choice to pick up any of the three packages. And basically, whoever has the highest kill streak, or whoever has the lowest kill streak is going to die. Oh, interesting. Tiana says choose your care package wisely. RNG. Oh, that's pretty good. I like that. I like that. I think I'm good. So Tiana says you three line up shoulder shoulder. Yeah. So we'll start with you. Tiana says what's your name? My name is Danster. Danster. Tiana says, Danster, what do you have? I have an Overwatch hero. Yes. Tiana says is this lebs in the middle? Super knocks. That's a knock. Tiana says super knocks. What have you got? I got a bomb drawn, man. Oh dear. Tiana says is this beast? Yes, it's beast. I have a Vance UAV. Okay. That's unfortunate. And the CBK can't kill me though. Can't it. The best CBK can't kill me though. Better can provide info to that rabbit. Tiana says you two follow me. We're going to have a ground finale. Is a bomb drawn lower than an advanced UAV? Tiana says. Yes, advanced UAV. Yes. Tiana says. 1 of you sit at this end of the table, Tiana says 1 of you sit at this end of the table. Tiana says there's the opportunity the both of you could win here. There's the opportunity that neither of you could win. Tiana says you can either choose to stand or crouch. Tiana says both you stand up. So, Tiao says, if both of you are standing, you both win, you both get shout out, and you both get 10 trillion Swift Bucks. Good job. Tiao says, if one of you choose it to crouch, the person crouches, wins the game, and takes the shout out, and they also get 400 trillion Swift Bucks. Tiao says, if you both crouch, you're both dead, and well, nobody wins. Interesting. You are. Tiao says, I'll give you a second to decide your choices. Beast, I'll cut you a deal. 200 Swift Bucks. 200 trillion, sorry. 200 trillion Swift Bucks, straight from me, if you stand. I'm not fair. But he doesn't have that. How did I use it? How did I use it? How did I use it? That's no fair. How did you use it? I swear on my card, the IPK. I see I won't crouch, all right? Man, man. Man, man, man. He's going to say they answered two ways. Yeah, I just took more seconds to deduct. It is the last day of your card. 10. I'm aware of that. I'm aware of that. I swear I won't crouch. Six, five, four, three, two, one. That's the end of discussions. Tiao says, both of you stand up to begin with, if you're on already. And on the count of three, when I get three, Tiao says you will choose even to stand, or to crouch. One, two, three. You asked. Tiao says, freeze. Let's go. Tiao says, turn around. Yeah, I know he's crouching. Tiao says, beast, kill him. Betrayal. Betrayal. Betrayal. Betrayal. Beast gaming. Betrayal. No one will ever touch the beast again. There's no one I'm not looking at. I want to win. I want to win. I'm going to win again. You're going to win. You can't stare at it. That's it. Beast wants to shout out. That was so dirty. Oh. Well, uh, uh, oh, oh, oh. Well, as much shout out, you Tiao will be the great person. And for being a good host for today, we did an excellent job. I would like to shout my girlfriend, Ivy. I'd love it to be serious. And I also go shout, dance her out. Either backstabbed or I'm sorry, I will give you 200 trillion swift boats. I appreciate it. And I shout, everyone out in the lobby. Thank you. So, you can just shout out. You've got just swift bucks. Just a shame. You don't have your credibility after that. Yep. Yep. No one will ever trust Beast ever. Again. All right. Tiao, an excellent job. That game lots of really cool stuff. Excellent finale. Everyone, ride up a plausible Tiao in there. Ride up a plausible Tiao. Yeah. All right. Thank you guys. You're welcome. Thank you. Thanks everyone.
