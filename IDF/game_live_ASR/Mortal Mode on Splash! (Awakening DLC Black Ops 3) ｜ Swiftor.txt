 Thanks for pressing like if you enjoyed the video. What is up, Unibros! Before we get this video started, I've got something special for you. So recently I partnered up with Gillette Shave Club and they challenged me to go head-to-head with my bro Craig from Screw Attack. And so it was a series of real-life challenges. Lemme know what, it's actually really freaking cool. It was like the most fun gig I ever did. So check out the link over here. Or click on the link in the description. Definitely worth checking out. Let me know what you think. Um, thought was awesome. But anyway, definitely check it out. Here's the video. Thanks guys. We're playing a game of mortal mode on splash. We'll do a tour of the map right after this. So Simpsaki, what he's gonna do is spin around in a circle and fire one shot at random. So Simpsaki spin around at least twice and then fire one shot. And no one died. Okay, next person will be the person on your left. We're gonna go clockwise. So who's next? Two chains, your turn. Go for it, man. Spin around. Alright, next. What's their name? Yo, Simpsaki, I'm looking through your eyes. To me favorite, like look at the people who were next. Not two chains, the guy next to him too, right? They're right. Vex, go for it, man. Spin around for me. Next. Yeah, Astro over here. He's next to you, James, your turn. Go for it, man. Spin around. Go for it. Go for it. Nice. What's their name? Yo, Simpsaki, look into your eyes. You're here. Like you. Vex. Vex, you're next to him. Whoa. Guys. Alright, there we go. Keep on going. I've taken care of the echo. Jummo, your turn. No one's dead yet. No one. We'll fix that to end of his... Oh, he did. Oh, he did. Oh, he's looking at the voice. Seeing what the voice mech echo was coming from. Keep on going. Oh. Kill him when he comes back. Thank you. Yeah. Alright, don't ever use that, guys. Uh, done first. Move up so you're in the circle, man. No, done first. Stop first. Move up in the circle. Alright. Sims. Alright. Guys, it's time for the bonus round. Only what two people died. What was that? Anyway, it's time for the bonus round. I want everyone to spin around. And when I yell fire, you fire one shot. Everyone spin. Everyone. Fire. Oh, beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Okay. Alright. Okay, excellent, guys. There's only what? Like... Six of you left. Six of us left. Move into the inner circle. The inner most circle. The blue one. The blue circle. The very blue one. Very middle. There we go. Excellent. Only six of you guys are left. When there are only two players left, we do the mini-game, the duel. So get ready. Sims, consider. You're going first. Alright. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Alright. Sims, go ahead again. If we do one more rotation, no one dies. We'll do this number of shots. Keep on going. Keep on going. Alright. So Sims, starting with you, you're going to fly her twice very quickly. You'll be like, boom, boom. Got it? Go for it. Two shots. Good. Alright. Next. I need a new spectator. And one. Oh, Sims is out. Keep on going. You got it, Riley. Go ahead. Two shots. Next. Riley, you're my eyes, man. Keep an eye on the person going. Thank you. Next. Yeah. The background music isn't stopping. Maybe because I'm expecting. Thank you. Keep on going. Oh, man. Oh, it's dying. Weird. There's a shotgun still. Oh, the Vythin's dead. Alright. Four players remain. You seem so happy. Stop. Everyone stop. Stop. Stop. First second. You have four players left. You have my voice cracked for a second there. We've got done first. We've got Astro. We've got Riley and we've got two chains. We don't have bets open right now. But like all of you guys in chat will let me know who these four people do you think will win the game. We've got done first. Astro, Riley and two chains. Let me know in chat. Who's going to do it? Put a photo. No, no, no, no. We don't have time for that. Continue the game. Continue the game. Yeah. Alright, Astro, go for it, man. Back, back, back up. Yeah, I wrote it. Astro said, oh! It's not. Wow. Plane of men. Wow. That's the only time that happened this entire match. Alright. The next. Two players left. And that's the way the news goes. Alright, so we've got, uh, we've got Riley and done first. Alright guys. Now before we begin, let me explain how a duel works. You guys probably know already, but I need to explain to everyone understands. At the end of our mortal mode of games, we do kind of like, uh, an old timey duel. We're both players standing in front of each other. The shake hands. Shake hands, guys. Alright, I don't think they can, there we go. Good enough. And then they turn around so that they're back to back. And when I give them the word, not yet, dudes, I'm going to ask them to walk as slowly as possible. And when I yell fire, they turn around, they aim and think it's fire one shot. There's no jumping. There is no moving around. There is no going to prone. You turn around, you aim and you fire one shot. Alright gentlemen, this is it. You both understand the rules, right? If you try and dodge the shot, you automatically forfeit the game. If you miss your shot, you just wait to die. You guys got it? Good. Alright, shake hands. One more time please. Great. Turn around so that you're back to back. Walk as slowly as the game will let you. Fire! I will say Riley didn't even look like he was moving, but whatever. I want to see this replay. Oh he was moving. He was moving. That is literally as slow as the game will let you. That was good. That's good. Well, I still can't see anything. I'm going to have to look at him. I'm going to have to look at him. I'm going to have to look at him. I'm going to have to look at him. I'm going to have to look at him. That was good. That's good. I thought you could get an instantly, but there we go. Congratulations to Riley on that victory. Well done. Well done. If you thought Riley would win, props to you. You predicted the future.
