Obviously one more player on the chief's team that players me. Everyone aim my feet. Fire. Thank you. All right. You guys will take turns. Fire and spinning. We're spinning and firing. Last team to survive is the winner. So listen closely for the rules. The first person to go first will be... ...Los Angeles Guerrilla skin. What team are you on? There's two of them. Whatever. Spin and fire. Are we gonna go clockwise from so to your left next player. Yep. That's you. Oh my god. So they can't hurt teammates but they can hurt the other team. God bless.
