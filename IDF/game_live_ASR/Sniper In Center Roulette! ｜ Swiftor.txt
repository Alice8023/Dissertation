 Make sure you tap the bell so you never miss a video. It's right next to the sub button. Thanks guys. What is up, Unibrow's welcome. Just a diaper roll up. Everyone's gonna take a moment to spin around, fire a shot. Hope they hit somebody, go back, and hope they don't die. So when it's your turn, you don't wanna center, you're gonna go do the same thing, right? We do it from the middle. Now who's gonna go first? That's a good question. Let's spin around. I'm gonna close my eyes and stop now. Burns, it's you. Congrats man. Oh, let's say next to you. Oh, rip me. Alright, we're gonna go, uh... Yeah, counterclockwise. Go for it man. Nope. Next. Oh, I hate, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. My bad, you've already went, but... I want done from the center, my friend. In the middle, that was my bad. No, no, Burns, you had your chance. You weren't paying attention. Neither was I. Miss out. Alright. That's not where the middle was. Whatever. Oh, that was... Alright, steak picked the wrong class. He's just sitting duck next. Aussie, elk, you're a baby. Give it a good spin. Get a shot. Looking good, next. Mm. Agents down. Alright, steak's running. Oh, oh, why would you take the... Why would you take that ammo? He was looking to grab that gun, man. Wow, dude, if someone dies, don't grab their stuff. Who did that? That was a dick move, bro. Decoi, got my eyes on you, man. You heard the plan. Alright, try to go for it. Do you remember where you're standing? Not really. Yep, go ahead, dude. Alright, guys, your sense of what the metal is is really, really off there. The middle of the circle. There you go. That's probably the best way I've seen so far. Go for it, man. Alright, keep it coming. Stealing ammo, I know. Only one fatality so far. What a shame. We'll fix that, though. No, it's fine. Can't trust the person engaged with the middle of a circle is then we're all doomed anyway. Alright, next. Don't touch it. Let the man try and... Nope. Oh, there we go. Now it's in it. You see? There we go. Alright, my turn. Decoi, I'm moving for you, man. You greedy bastard. Try it, the floor. Alright, I'll take it. Alright, there we go. Go, brins. I hear the right this time. I see bites is out. Oh, oh, oh. Rip I see. Alright. Next. Keep it moving, boys. I can't eat my dinner. I can't eat my dinner. Things allowed, apparently. Hang on. No showboating, motherfucker. No showboating. Next time, it's your head. Not a lot of the jumpers. Donge or whatever. Keep that stuff for your own montages, alright? Try to show off. Aim bot. Yeah, man. T-bone. Rip. Aim in for me, bitch. Come at me, bro. Who was that? I saw you, aim at me. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Vater. Alright, man. I would never do that, so. It looks like it. It doesn't look like it. Alright. I go for a musty. Next. Go on. Go ahead. Next. Alright. After my turn, hold up. Nothing. Alright, guys. Stay in your spot. Time for our bonus round. Everyone's spin. Just keep spinning. Wanna give you the word, you're gonna fire a single shot. Everyone's spin. If you don't spin, I'm gonna take your life myself. Keep on spinning. Don't be shy. Keep on, don't stop. I see you stop your dead. Stop spinning. I'd kill you. I'd kill you. Fire! Wow. That's stuck. No one died. Alright. Alright. Everyone. Move in. Move in. I want him to shoulder to shoulder in the circle. No spaces between anyone. Wanna say there's like no way a bullet can escape. Move in. Take the move. Move in, baby. No. What? No gaps. It's pretty good. This is good enough. Alright, there we go. We'll hublin. Everyone wiggle their snappers in the middle. Wiggle it. If you don't wiggle it, I will end your life. You think you're exempt from wiggling? Your hands, Berg? Do you wiggle that? Wiggle it! Wiggle it! Wiggle it! Wiggle it! Wiggle it! Wiggle it! Wiggle it! Do you know what a wiggle is? How about this guy? Black and red. You don't want a wiggle, bro? You. Is he wiggling? Dude. Black and red. You've got two seconds of wiggle, bro. Otherwise. Well, that's too much wiggle. Get your ass back in the circle. Alright. Okay, that's enough. That was a social experiment. Alright. Anyway, burns. Into the center. There we go. Ew, no, that's not what we're doing. I want to do a cool effect of snappers. I want to do a cool effect of snappers. I want to do a cool effect of snappers kind of like, you know, snapper dolls is moving all around. Didn't really work out. What are you, what are you doing? Dude, spin. No, don't, don't. I will, I can do it now. Well, I can do it. He was the last of wiggle anyway. Alright. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Oh, wow. I like it here. I'm watching this screen to hear you guys. Something like 30 seconds behind every. Next. Cool story, bro. Next. Oh. Oh. Oh, hell's bad. I was really looking forward to getting somebody, but you know, sometimes a dream has to be shot. So a bigger dream can live. Alright, you guys can move on without me. Let's keep on going. Looks like they're going to hit me. It's something they were trying to aim. The guy who doesn't try. Oh, there we go. Stakes he is out. There we go. People are going down. That's what I want to see. Alright. There's an outreach child in background. How'd you miss that shot they said? I heard it. Oh, yeah, llama. They must aim for your boy. Jake is out. What? He is hit like every time. Are you sure he doesn't have target at this time? Oh, I'm heading out. I'll spectate him. I don't think so. He's missed some shots. He missed the first two shots. Let's see. Added it on afterwards. But I'll be able to find out. It doesn't look like it. They slow down after they spin. Besides, everyone's like super close. People dying is what happens. No. No target. I have it. I think three in a row. He's got no target. It says boys. Unless he has someone kind of aim bot. Pretty feast. So, it has to put him to a land. Sick. I mean, put him on the ground. Hey, I'm going to get him. Sick. I mean, put him on the ground. Aim bot turned off that round. Aim bot deactivated. Few are using the aim bot though. I will end your life. But yeah, four people left. Three left. Three left. Two. Three. Three. Three. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Are you on? Are you on voice chat? Are you using an aim bot? Yeah. No, I don't. You won't. Wait, you say yes? No, I don't. Wait, what? Are you using an aim bot or not, man? I heard you. No, I don't. All right. All right. All right, jump in. Head to the tank. I want you both on the nozzle. Oh, I killed seven kills. No, if you had aim assist, it would slow down when I went over a player. The reason we drop aim assist slows down. All right. All right, jump in. Here's what's going to work. Give up a little bit closer. Give it a shake, hence. They're going to turn around so you're back to back. All right. Now, the way it's going to work is I'm going to let you know to walk as slowly as the game will let you when I say fire. You turn around and you use your one bullet. No jumping. No dodging. No crouching. You stay in that spot. You turn around. You aim. You pull the trigger and you're done. Stay miss. Use weight. You take your shot, etc, etc. All right. Walk as slowly as the game will let you. Fire! Take that. All right. I don't think it was aim-bottling, dudes. I don't know how the aim-bots work. I don't think they actually require aim assist to be turned on or whatever. What was that? Shum the finger. Maybe the hell's-batch. Maybe the hell's-batch was aim-bottling. All right. Good game, guys. GG. GG. That was fun. Thanks for watching.
