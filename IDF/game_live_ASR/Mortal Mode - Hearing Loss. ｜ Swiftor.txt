 Thanks for pressing like if you enjoyed the video. What is up Unibrow's Replanes? Some mortal mode? It's basically what? Brushed in a lot in Call of Duty. Players will spin around, then fire a shot at random. Last two players, lie, play a duel. How about you play along yourselves? Who from this list do you think will win? I'm on this list. I win sometimes, but not often. Alright, how do you guys feel about this match? You think you're gonna do okay? I'll go this. How do I go? I'm probably gonna go. A mix of pessimism and optimism. This will wait for me. Alright, the player that's gonna start first will be? Nope. There we go. Oh, I guess you're Grand Lantern. You're more statistically likely to kill me anyway than anyone else. So go for it. Spin around and fire one shot at random. Please make sure you're Amesist and whatever turned off. Yeah, let's go. Oh, Steven. Where's Steven? Oh, he's right over there. Rip Steven. Alright, let's go counterclockwise. Who's next to Grand Lantern? Shoot. Yeah, that's you. That's you, Ricardo. Ricardo, and we're Cardino. Alright, keep on going, guys. You'll know when it's your turn. I'll enter at least. Yes, sure. Yes. Being able to fire one shot before you dies. Hey, you got your wish. Ricardo, you know, God has got that wish anyway. That's what I mean. I'm so cold. Scary. Oh, a double. Yeah, I remember me first. Thanks for that. No. Oh, that's where I got out. Oh, gallows out. Oh, what? Double. Damn. Hey, why are you copying me? Oh, survive the round. Alright, here we go. Nothing. Alright. And so with round two begins. Go for it. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I saw that. I saw that. I saw that. He aimed for me. You missed it. He like aimed at me. He timed it. And he timed it. Okay, I don't know. I don't know. You do every night Green Lantern. Because he still spins. He still spins. Uh. Everybody check him out soon. Check him out soon. Alright Mark, someone can do your eyes. I don't think- Oh, Jace whizzles out. There you go J. That's what I was when he cooked for me. Wow, how do bruises survive that? He can't believe it. Rip, penguin. Tyler, you're good bro. Robbic, Robberson. Farts it off. What was that? He's a giant zombie. Alright, stop, stop. What? Hey, kidchill, chill. Let's tighten up the circle a little bit. Not too tight, but you know. Get in there. Equalize the space among each other. Get a little closer. There we go. I love my boy, Jesus. Thank you for subscribing. There we go, man. Alright. Alright, cool. Let's continue. Thanks for subbing, dude. Enemy down. Bruzy, rip. Next. We're dude 87th, thanks for doing 9 months in a row. Sometimes I forget to turn off notifications in the matches, but this is fine. Oh, well, let's do that crouch over there, bro. Oh, I think. Keep a vanilla, my friend. Oh, Rob is out. Keep on going, bitch. Don't be distracted. Look, Marcos. Oh, you killed my spectator, bro. Alright, Tyler, I'm looking through your eyes. Yay. Oh, J.R. is out. Keep on going. We're lacking a vanilla. Stop the game, collateral. After the next death, I need you guys to stop. Alright, stop. Stop, I need you guys to stop. Alright, we got Tyler and Irish kid remaining. Congratulations, guys. You're at the end, either because you're extremely skilled or extremely lucky. But let's have you guys meet in the middle of all these corpses over here, right in the middle of the island. That's right, step on those friends. There we go. Good job. Alright, move a little closer once you guys. Right up, right face to face. Face to face. A little closer. A little closer. There we go. Alright, sweet. So in a duel, you guys will shake hands, turn around so they're back to back, then walk as slow as the game will let you. And when I yell fire, you'll turn around, you'll aim and you're fire one shot. You can't jump around, you can't go into prone, you can't dodge, you turn around, you aim and you fire. You can look down your sights if you want to. That might cost you time, but it's up to you. Keep your sensitivity exactly how it is though. Alright, gentlemen, shake hands when you're ready. You know, I wish shake those hands, bro. Be a gentleman. Irish. Irish, just, Irish, look up and look down several times. That's what I mean by shaking hands. Go for it. This is not going to end well. Alright, Delman. There we go. He's wiggling a little bit, shaking it off. Alright, guys, turn around so they're back to back. Oh yeah, this is not going to work out. Can he not? He's right. This is not going to work out. Alright, gentlemen, walk as slowly as possible. I wonder who's going to win this one. Big surprise here. Fire! Take your time, you have all the time you need. Yay, I win! Surprise, surprise. The guy who could hear me won the game. Alright, congratulations, Tyler. Irish, good, I'd work on getting the headset sorted out. Alright. All right. Good game, guys.
