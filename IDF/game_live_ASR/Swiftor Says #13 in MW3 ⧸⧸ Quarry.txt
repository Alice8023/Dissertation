I'll see the one and say he ain't gonna last too long. Look, look we're not we're not gonna kill him. So go space we before I start this recording I we did like a little hello to all the people we are here for the very first time. Go space it's his first game. So ghost face. It's not instant death, but it is a challenge. So just as a ghost face well I'm not saying Swiftress has talked to you. Ghost face is there a particular challenge you like from the videos man. Anything come to mind. Any any challenges that you would like. Like you like I could win that. Let's say probably the um That's a top one man. Do you like parkour do you like you know melee.

You're guessing your name. Yeah. There we go. There I just didn't want to touch the ground. Great job. So does this. You're good. All right. Great. So if says please follow me. I feel a little bad for a ghost face though. I thought it was easy. No. I appreciate you being a good sport. It's time for the conveyor belt. I just couldn't believe I only listened to you in it. Yeah. You guys are all here for. We're doing a Michael Myra's on high high rise after this. You guys are all. I'm kind of excited. I've never done it. It'll be good. It'll be more fun than this if you ask me. So if says everyone. Feet on the conveyor belt please. I'm going right here. Hey, your feet are not all there, man. It is on there. No, your feet aren't. Your feet aren't. So if door says go into broad. It's okay. Okay. See. All right. All right. Okay. Great. All right. Make my way up here, guys. You guys are like the red carpet from. I'm not walking on the man. They'd be very disrespectful. I'm walking along with you guys. There we go. All right. So it just says crawl as far as nine as you can without leaving the conveyor belt. Guys, guys, it's just don't. We want as many people on the conveyor belt and prone as possible. And then when then as short of distance as possible. This reminds me of a movie. No. God. That's it. I'm just going to do it. Even doing those jokes for years. Oh, thank you. Plus this will be a very sloppy human centipede. This is no good. Want a real human centipede maybe later. What? All right. I have a new. All right. Get ready. That's so good. I tossed that smoke in the wrong spot. Sir, did you stand up for some reason? Rainbow capa? No. No. I did not. Are you sure? Yes. I don't know. Am I just getting old? No. All right. Swiftress says first person a stand-up dies. Pretty good. Last person a stand-up dies. These are the classics. All right. In front of you guys is this truck. Last person up here dies. Go. That's a proximity mine. Listen, you do not need to run towards a proximity mine. You can run the long way around. You can crawl around. There's many safe ways to do this. Someone else can get you killed. Swiftress says, just get on the truck. No race. How does he can get up? Part of the content. Oh, what are you doing? Come on, man. What? God damn it. I tried to kill someone. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All right. We're up on you. There we go. New Texas chainsaw. I played with my Texas chainsaw back in August, but this is a new update, right? I'll check it out. I'll check it out. Going me out. Yes, I love it. I like Texas chainsaw, but I mean, I do wish I had some kind of like, God. Hey, I'm good. Open, uh, open voice chat between teams. I understand why there's not, but I think it's more fun. I think we can make a game of room up there. Good job. There you go. Swiftress says aim your guns straight up in the air. Swiftress says fire one shot. Swiftress says jump. Hey, right. Any reason you're not looking straight up anymore, man? I get tired. Swiftress says fire two shots. Swiftress says crouch. Oh, what the hell? Ooh. Riot. That's strike two. Riot. I don't want to kill someone over just not looking down. Right? Simple. Just people give it this guy. It's important. The porn to the game. Great. Swiftress says stand up and you die. Swiftress says last person to stand up is in trouble. You're looking around wanting to feel the last person stand up. Well, you are. It is charging. Come on down. All right. Here is the game. Swiftress says you're one on the truck. Your job is to prevent him from getting on the truck. If he gets on top of the truck, he's going to be in trouble. If he gets on top of the truck, everyone will be punished. If you don't get on the truck, only you'll be punished, charging. Swiftress says everyone can look down again. Big right your strategy. How will you prevent charging, going from getting on top of the truck? They make it very clear. I'm only going to count one part of the truck, the cargo area, you know, the, or this thing, the marble, whatever it's carrying. It's going on top of that part, not the front. Oh. Yeah. All right. Swiftress says you have 10 seconds to figure it out. Have you guys forgot your, your offensive strategy? Somebody go into prone on the backside of the truck. Put proximity to mine here. For the environment. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? You want to die? You want to die? No. Okay. Great. What, why are you even at me, dude? All right. Go. What's going on? You have 30 seconds. Good luck. All right. I want to stop. Go. I dude. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Look. I didn't say Swiftress says, well, I still, you know, I want to see this movie game happen. So it doesn't go. I'm just going to punish Swiftress come back. I originally was going to give you 30 seconds. As a punishment for messing up there, I'll also give you 18 seconds. So it just says go. 18 seconds. Gotta get up there somehow, man. Get right here. If you can climb up, you can do it. Get up there. Get in seconds. Make sure you don't get up there. All right. Six seconds. What was me doing? Four. Three. Not a P.A. buddy, too. Nope. Can't get that one. Not this way. Swiftress says kill it. Oh. Oh, wait. Sorry, but you got to take one for detain. All right. It was a good try, man. They did a pretty good job, you know, depending on. All right. I'm up there. I'm in front of your. Some of these marble things can climb, some of you can't. You know, it takes me time to figure out. Oh, you know what? Hang on. Sort of as trooper. Come on over. Oh, no. Okay. You know, let me turn. So it says please let trooper out. I don't know what I just did, to be honest. Probably because you hate puppy. Why? No, no. So it was a trooper. You were, is that the window you got on top of before? Find Seek. Yeah. Yeah. So it says can you go there now? Yeah, these sets with their sons. Yeah, I did. Yeah. So it says everyone else? Come over here and watch trooper. Get on this window. Do play hide and seek and trooper did really well. Did you win that game? I did. You won that game. Yes. And uh, two, one. Hang on. I don't, I don't know if they've had it. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think they fetched this. I'm sure you can still do that. Yeah. I want you guys to see trooper do it first. If he can and then you guys will do the same thing. Or if he fetched terminal, I don't, I don't know about this. All right. If he can't do the next couple of tries, we'll just assume it's not possible anymore. Yeah. That maybe is one more try. I think they patch it. Switching the trest. We're from terminal. Swiftress says if you think you can do it, go ahead. Well, yeah. Well, you guys go. You guys go for one. That's a swipper says go and try if you want. No. I don't believe it's possible. I mean, you do that very reliably all game. So the fact that he can't. Yeah. Yeah. It's not manageable again. All right. There we go. They patched it. That's too bad. All right. Swiftress says follow me then. There goes that idea. All right. Yeah. All right. Let's do this. Last man, I'm staying close to you. Why? You don't want to get close to me. Rob trapped in here. This is what I'm doing. You don't want to stand in front of me, dude. Bell. Bell. Bell. Bell. Bell. Bell. Bell. Bell. Bell. Bell. All right. Here are the rules. Swiftress says you can look towards me behind you guys. Swiftress says once you stand on this fence, then I'm standing on. You'll blow up the red barrels there if they're still there. Swiftress says go. I am too far away. No. No. Swiftress says stand on the goddamn gate. Get up. Go up. I'm only one. Are you going? Oh, dang. Where all hasn't killed anybody? I'm going. Swiftress says spread out. Give him some room. Nice. Nice. Oh, that's nice. Hey. Hey, there's more room. I want to blow it up. Yeah, yeah, that's a good blow. Pretty great. All right, Swiftress says it's very important that you guys stay on this fence. If you fall off, and I catch you, you die. All right, Swiftress says. Let's make sure one is familiar with their clockwise and counterclockwise. It says look in the clockwise face and direction. If you're going clockwise, which direction would you go in? Think about a clock. Maybe it's maybe maybe it's maybe about two to young. Think about it. I'm just saying. Which way did you say? I learned the word lesson. The last one. There we go, Mark. There we go. One blow. All right, you be a sheep. All right, Swiftress says. Slowly walk clockwise. Oh, oh, there's this group. Yeah, you dance. Chip, or I thought I saw you fall off, but I think I'm just getting old, man. But yeah, so just please move. Swiftress, move clockwise. It doesn't be slowly to scale. I want to see you moving in clockwise direction. Swiftress is ready. I thought someone stabbed me. That's what I thought. Staying here. I'm trying to attack Sprint. So what happened when you missed leg day? My legs are shaking, bro. You can actually go through it. The door says stop. Yeah, they've got some practice. Swiftress has continued facing clockwise. Say that direction. Yep. Swiftress says crouch. The chain is up just a little bit. All right, face counterclockwise. Makes you know what direction that is. Boy, you're so lucky. Oh, my gosh. You're so lucky, sir. I'm so lucky. Yeah, so lucky. Yeah, so lucky. I don't count. You're fun. Oh, Swiftress says turn around to the counterclockwise. Swiftress says walk. Swiftress says walking. Count what? Swiftress says crouch. Crouch walk. Full speed counterclockwise. Go. Full speed. I see you stopping and someone is not in front of you. You die. Full speed. I can't. You can get everybody. You guys doing great. Looking really good. High trooper. Don't make me laugh. I'm a fool. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. And Jay was trying to sneak away. Y'all got to go. I was trying to go with. I saw it. Let's do it in front of us on this. How many players are left? A lot. All right. And stop. Bart. Good move. Oh, Bart. Good work. Good work. Good work. Good going, man. Good going. I'm trying. I'm trying. Oh no. Swiftress says freeze. Stuck. You guys involved. You have to waste your speed. You guys did a great job. Okay, so next challenge involved a little bit of speed and a little bit of luck. Swiftress says if you look down, you may or may not see some red barrels. What does it look wherever you want now? I think we're finding. Oh, yes. You do wear barrels. Yeah. I'm going to put one bullet into these barrels. Swiftress says after you see even a little bit of fire, you need to make your way to where I am right now. Swiftress says that'll be to your east. I'm dead as hell. There will be challenges along the way. Box him in your mind there. Box him in your mind there. I don't know how you get it up here. I just want people to die. Swiftress says look for the fire. Oh. That one died. You know, I think I'll have to help that 50 for this game. That's why no one's done the proximity mines. I felt it, though. I felt it. My ass is on fire. Wait, it's fine. If your next par-core challenge is in German. All right, first, I'm going to show that I can do it for myself. No. Well, I failed. Well, I would have done. But you're not going to do that. This example of what not to do. All you have to do is run, jump, and land on the fence. If you miss the fence, that means floor and in the direction. You'll go into prone and way for further instruction. Swiftress says begin. I need room. Back up. Oh, back up. Back. All right, success. Yeah, I need room to jump. Can they move out? That's what I'm saying. Yeah, it's not a race. As we give room. Success, good job, Zeno. There you go. So, all right, whoever's this is a crime. Fail. Oh, oh, oh, fail. Yeah. Did you? Oh, fail. I'm a go next. I'm a go next. Because we don't need to jump at the same time. There we go. Last minute. Never back down. Never what? You gave up. Fail. They need a they need to back down and give up. Good job. Fail. What did you see that, Matt? Nope. It's not instant death. That's what I'm having to go into prone. Don't worry. You have a chance. And I'm usually trashed, apart, cool. If it's a death, it's a beautiful place. Only three of you guys left. Come on, Banner. You got this, Banner. I cannot, I cannot calculate those kinds of things. Actually, you got this. Oh, God. Just believe. You were a thing. I know. I should have. Hmm. Yeah, you're right. I mean, a mental. I should have a mental. I should have. A mental count. In the floor, he didn't touch the floor. Okay. Great. So it says you, let me see. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So it says you seven. Please go stand on the, uh, the rock level. It's one level below where you jump from. Yeah, right there. So it says. You guys are the fire squad. Wait, Swift, we made it over the fence. Does that count? No, no, it does not. So it says all of you guys. So it says fire squad over here, please. All right, everyone in prone. You get one more try. This, some of you fail, though, the police players will kill you. Which is please return to your, uh, to your jumping spot. Yep. Okay. You know, think of that last try as, uh, practice. Yes. Can we practice again? Hey, look, the people that are prone up here on the firing squad that's behind us, please don't shoot us in the back of our ears. Guys. All right, firing squad, please be careful. It will not shoot them unless they touch the floor down there or the floor over there. All right, once you clear it, once I say you've passed, you can safely join the firing squad. All right, Swift or says begin. Success. Join the firing squad. That's good. That's, uh, sorry, poison. I still like the stick. Serve of a bitch. X-ray, I believe in you. Next. I made it. I'm. Oh, wait, so this is wait. So this is wait, please. I he made it. He made it. He made it. No. Cool. I made it. He made it. He made it. He made it. He was coming over. Oh, come over. All right. He jumped off. All right. He jumped off after that. That's that's fine. Next. I've had it and he's like underneath. So close. Well, he didn't. Oh, it didn't touch the floor. If they if they man, I don't know, they're not even fine. Next. He's turning. After you, Dyer, you go. Banah. Nope. That wasn't touching them. That wasn't the one. Banah. It was a ban of it. He was from. Banah. Banah. So what was that? Wait, Banah. Did he touch the floor? Yes. Show me the floor. Go show me the floor. You touch it. What? So this is a banah. Please show me the floor that he touched. He jumped. He jumped on like he jumped on this ledge right there. And the other guy did it too. Does that count as a mean? Does that count as a mean? The other guy did it too. He's trying to count as a floor. No, because he missed the mantle. That's why he missed the mantle. He killed them. We killed two. We killed the other guy like that too. Why is it? Why is the problem now? He went over the ladder. Okay, well count them as floor. That's fine. So this is Banah. All right, you're fine. No crime has been committed. I mean more crimes have been committed, but not by you. All right. All right. So if it's a matter, you can return. All right, next. X-ray, I believe in you. Is that a legal jumper? Are we going to get shot if we land on that ledge? If you land on the ledge, you will die. If you if you mantle on to the top, though, if you if you like grapple, that's that's fair. Okay. All right. I got a perfect. I want to go next. Actually, just get it over with. Are you guys all right? So just a dark sit. Dark right next, man. Let's go. Success. There we go. Good job, man. Join the fire squad. You made it. Next. No, Rainbow. All right. Rainbow got a lot of training. Sins and wins. Go for it. And have a good. I like a man. Yeah, he made it. He made it. Oh, he fell off. He was. He made it. He made it. He was. He was. He was. No, there was no stability. There was no stability. There was no stability. No stability. Okay. Who's X-ray go for it? Oh my. You got this X-ray. No. No. No. And Vox, man. Who is this person? Who is this? Yeah. Right up there. Someone in random just joined us. No, Jay. No party. Random. Who's the rat? What? Who's? Which one? Josh. He's standing. I don't know. Oh, Josh? No, Josh wasn't the game. No, Swift or behind you. I'm going to get over here. Sir. Right here. Right here. Is that hiding? He's hiding. Sir. He's hiding. He's proud. I'll tell you what, little X. If you'd complete that challenge, you can join us. Go ahead. We'll do the challenge. He's probably not in the discord. Yeah. He's not in the discord. He's not in the discord. Oh, fuck. I fell off. Oh. Don't foul shoot him. Swift just says go to the challenge. He's he's he's he's not listening to the stream. He doesn't know what he's supposed to do. Well, well, then why you want to do that? Now he knows. That's a little kid. This is one of your friends. Okay. That's okay. All right. I tried. I tried. I know. Great. All right. We got a much fewer players left now. 10 minutes left now. It's time for bad things to happen. Swift or says, please follow me. Yeah. Xeno, I just noticed here is a bloodthirsty. A swoopter is pretty much. All right. So it says blood shoulder to shoulder? Xeno got almost all those kids. I'm fine. I'm fine. It's a pretty big ladder. All right. This is a game where the order in which you're in this ladder is going to count. The person at the top will be number one. And the person at the bottom will be number. Maybe more. 11. Assume 11 people get fit on here. I think 11 people get fit on here. Chat's gonna vote for a number to kill. So the order you got this ladder is going to matter. All right. Well, guys, all right. I'm going to turn around. You guys can begin going with the ladder. Good luck. They're just as freest. He's. Yeah. No. Swift or says. I did not say. I did not say. Swift or says. So. Default. Sab Riot. Dark. They cool mantras. All the guys going that ladder. How did you fall for that? No voting yet, guys. I haven't. I haven't. We haven't voted yet. Guys, we haven't voted yet. Get happened. The chat is thirsty. Chat sends death. Oh, wow. They really. All right. Swift says everyone else back up. All right. Swift says we have riot. FIFA. The cool man. Dark. Swift says. You four. Which says you four make it one. Go. Good luck. They want blood. So does you four kill each other? Come on, figure it out. Look at his. Oh my god. That's right. Why have everyone seen him there? So. Why have they seen him there? What? I'll never see him. You get to come. Never see the Joe like it. What's the pistol? They had the advantage. There's a cool man. Cool man. I've been in Kool-Aid body. I'm in. I know. But cool man did not. She want to shoot someone in the butt. Because he's a man of honor. All right. So does it be a fun? You rejoined the players here? Two games. He's you man. All right. So what does that say? You wait. Go on the ladder and anywhere do you choose? Viewers will be choosing one number between numbers of one and eight to kill. Now, yes, surely I will say during our last what does that say? There's one before. The number seven was the most popular to kill in the the washing machine game. So what does that say? I'll give you guys some time to get in the ladder. Yeah. No votes. Yeah. Yeah. I can't move up. All right. I'm trying to listen for when you guys are done here. Yeah, there's no one. There's no room for one of the guys. There's a few of you guys that can go up still. Hang on. Hang on. So it says how many people are on the ladder? Seven. Total seven. Good. And there's one person who's not. Yes. Okay. Well, here we go. The person who's not on the ladder. You are number eight. Boss man. What do you just say his name? Why would you do that? Why would you say his name? Congratulations. I'm in the darkroom. Congratulations. There's about to be a room on this ladder for somebody else. Actually, is he dead? Is there a couple already dead? He is dead. He is dead. I'm under the blue. I'm in him. We should bring him that time. Ah. Dost that man. Oh, why? Rainbow camp. I'm getting a little bruised man. I thought you were in it. Get someone to that yesterday. No, you're in muted broken out of here. Someone did that yesterday as well. I thought he was. I'm in it. Swiftress says everyone climbed to the top. All right. There goes that mini game. Oh, sorry guys. No voting. No voting for that one. It's man. He would number two. He would have been fake. If someone knows who's down there, then that's unfair. Then they know they can target somebody. All right. Sorry, sir. Oh, you just ran all the way. If you dropped off, you got to come back up. Great. Which one says you guys wait over here? I'm gonna carefully climb down. So what he said, wait. All right. I hope he does. He probably wants to get as close to the door as possible. There's a way. I'll be a push. I don't fall damaged. You'll be fine. Yeah, you're not gonna fall. You have 50 health. There is no fall damage. But you lose health. Now the questions if you fall down and hit a proxy in mine, will you still live? I don't know. Oh, well, I'm about to find out. Look, look, look, chicken. I'm glad you're in the game, man. You've been doing it really great. Oh, this is it. Look, sort of says chicken. If you can climb up there without dying, then you're good to go. How are you good? There you go. The fear and chicken's eyes. Got to be careful. All right, great. Oh, let chicken out. Let them out. Let them out. The same person as well. The guy joined again. The guy joined again. He's behind you. Don't worry. You can't talk. Don't worry about it. Great. Real simple. Swift or so. Oh. God, dammit. Whoever has that little J dude as your friend might want to close your party. Oh, there. What can it get on this guy's embryo? I'm going to you. Wishing me. There we go. All right. I got my hands on the side. Please, guys, please. Don't worry about it. He's not doing anything. All right. It's surprisingly. Swift says. The last three people to get. The last three people to get behind me die. Go. There we go. There we go. Well, Matt Beckton. He moved. Where did Swift go? All right, I lost the other two. Yeah, those mocks of mine's. It looks okay. Dude. I'll rejoin. Dude, you're making everybody nervous, man. I know you're not doing it then. You're making everyone nervous. All right, great. We have two and a half minutes left. I missed my set for gun. Oh, no. I'm still okay. Stop laughing at my mind. Yeah, the way that Tim skins just kind of hanging there. I'm pretty sure he's going to get a sentry gun. All right, I'm going to put this mosquito drone over there. The mosquito drone is once. Uh-oh. Oh, no. Swift says shoot down the mosquito drone. I don't want it to be a factor. Thank you. All right, let's see here. Guardian, that's good. That's not good. Sentry guy. Oh, do I not get a rotate between these? No, unfortunately not. That's okay. Easy. That works. Oh, I do get to do it. Oh. Oh, I'm not good. Swift says I may run away if I want to. Swift says the first person to stab me wins the entire game. Good luck. Well, no, no, there's a good soul man. Wow. Did anyone stab me? I don't know. A G out. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no winners here. I got so close. Yeah, my plan was to run into my own minds so that they'd die from it. I did not realize that the mine was so close. I tried to just jump off the street. You were right there. All right, under the guardian. No rats here. Seven-way tie. I got close. Yeah, let's go. Hey, never tell it. What? My third win in both of our three. All right. Go rats. All right, GG's guess.
