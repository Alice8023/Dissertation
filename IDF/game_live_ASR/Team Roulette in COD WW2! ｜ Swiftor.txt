 Hey guys, glad you're watching and thanks for presently if you enjoyed the video. What is up dudes, we're playing team sniper relat. So we got two teams, there's no collateral damage. We should've turned that on though. And we got everyone here. Let's spin in that full speed. Let's spin yes. There we go. So the way it's going to work is that we're going to go back and forth having a player on each team, spin around and fire a shot at random. Last team left wins. If there's only two players left or one player on each team left, they'll do a duel. All right dudes, good spins. Let's begin. I guess I'll go first. I feel a little bit bad about that. You know what, Gilman? You go first, dude. I insist. All right, my turn. Nothing. All right. Next up, Spartan. There we go. And now, uh, Jurydius. You guys get the trend here, get the routine. There we go. Yep. I got a bad view here. If you will, we get better when I live. To the person to arrive, Jurydius. Yeah, pay attention, bro. It's your turn. Peyton. There you go, buddy. The Peyton's shoe yet. Donate it. Pig. All right, guys, you're going to have to actually pay attention and figure out when it's your turn. All right. This guy is really obsessed with snipers. Jeez. There we go. All right, potato. Good kill. All right. Next. Hey, who is at the end? Cheek. That is not when you're done at the end. Oh, we lost instigator. No. Well lost. It's lazy. Oh, hard. All right. Uh, we're back to you, Gilman. They saw it's definitely right. Anyone my team haven't gone yet? All right, my turn. Here we go. Don't worry. Whatever it is, the team's always even on the end. It's like magic. Yeah. Gil, you're up. All right, we're back to my turn. But before I go, I want to do a bonus round. For this one, I'm actually going to be a little bit selfish. I'm going to step out of the area. I might still die, I need to all of you guys to spin and when I yell out fire, you know, fire your snap a rifle. Let's go for it. Everyone spin full speed. Redical. Chess level. Keep on spinning. Fire. Oh, that's that's that's that dude. Stop stop firing. You got it, buddy. It was one shot. All right. Back to my turn. Here we go. All right, go for it. This requires a good level of organization between everyone in the game. This is this is an impressive thing that we're doing here. What are two people on the end meeting? You're shooting the same. Come on, dudes. Oh, you're pulling for me, man. You're you're hero. All right, Gil, you're up. Hey, it's my go. Nothing. Oh, Gil, man. Yes. My arcanemis is gone. Oh, yes. Yes. There you go. Rough. All right. Hang on, dude. Still hang on. When I so in general, guys, when I die, one of these games, you want to wait a little bit so I can like, so I can like position my camera. Sorry, sir. That's all right. I know you're going to you to take your turn. All right. I'm going to get a fine. I could spot for this. All right. Let's get got a good view. Go for it. Thank you, son of a man. Come on, Gene. I know if the God's stop us. Wait, wait, dude. You got a. Turns on us if they're ahead. Great view. What are you talking about? Get the blue sky. The battleships in the background on fire. Get to see everyone. Oh, this is a great view. The plaid pants are pretty good, man. Look like pajamas. I'm digging them. Why is PAI to shoot in? If you're not sure, default the team that has not with the less players. And it's potato and then I see. Yeah, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on. Did you spend for that one? Yeah, you did. I watched it. All right. Go ahead. Oh, sorry. Three boys. Three be three. Hey, go twice on a row. We skipped you. So potato, you can go. Go at potato. Look at that. T-monesty right there. Out of ammo. Yeah, I got in the middle. Your turn. Oh, me. Yeah. Good. Oh, all right. Lost. Oh, yeah. Reloading. Cover me. Guys, both one at the same time. Reloading. Is a little bit confusing. Hang up. Wait. Let's potato turn. I see you go next. Then guy in the middle. I don't see your name on that screen. Potato. I see. Back the first person. The other team. I see. Need ammo. Give me the first. Oh. Got some confusion going on. Reloading. Cover me. What is happening? I'll tell you what, guys. I'll tell you what. Let's get a little confusing, right? Let's just have everyone spin. Now keep on firing. Well, I guess that's it. All right. That's a lose for my team. Great idea, Swift or great idea. The no scope of the game. Let's try this again, but we're going to do some a little bit different. There'll still be two teams. Friendly fire will be enabled. We're going to have we're going to be in a circle and there will be shotguns. Twisted that game. All right, here we go. Round two. Everyone's got shotguns. Friendly fire is enabled. You can kill your teammates. And when it's your turn, you go into the center. So let's see who's going to go first. It'll be you. I'm going to go first. You. All right, hang on. Let me get back to my spot first. All right, day go to the center. Spin away. I'll kill your teammates. Oh, all right. You got lucky. All right. All right, we're going to go counterclockwise. So potato, you're up next. Oh, wow. This is my entire team over here. Not going to be good for you guys. Oh, okay. Played monstered out. Over there. Move it. Dumbo. All right. Not bad. Remi. They're on the move. They're making their backs. Interesting. No team kills yet. It's a play we can't be friends. Pretty sure I turned off. Turned on. Friendly fire. Hey. I'm on screen. Gilman go for it. Going for me. Oh, don't take your turn yet. Oh, all right, hang on. All right. Next. Go on, dad. I better screw up the settings. Oh, no, but it's working fine. Never mind. It's working fine. All right. There you go. Feel a lot better now. Yeah, over there. It's a little hard to move around because it's so high. Ooh, potatoes out. I'm going to show you those. It's a day. You guys do get a better point of view when I die. That is true. Oh. I'm reloading. There's only five of them left. They're all surrounding you. Yeah, man. I was thinking about going to the trouble of making it like, you know, like red green, red green, red green, but I didn't think I want to spend another 10 minutes organizing that. Oh. If you got a microphone, I'd like for you to call who you think you're going to hit. Oh, teammate. Sorry, I see. See, kill me. That's fine. I'm going to go for a hide. Go for the go for the center. Yep, buddy, buddy. Just middle of the circle. Yeah, get enough. Go ahead. Go ahead. That's fine. Oh, we're so high. Resout. You got your good call, man. Yep, you got your call right.

Let me just fly around and figure out where you guys are going. Free moves kind of cool. You. Turn around and find. Go on the edge. I'll follow your control. All right. Make your way to uh, basically, remember we did the shovel 1v1s? Anyone remember that one? You run like the wall. Yeah, go along like the the ridge of the wall. It doesn't matter which one, but basically you guys are going to be doing that. And on there. There you go. Yeah, perfect, perfect. All right. So glad you guys remember. All right. Yep, yep. So climb up there. So we're going to do this traditional, you know, uh, mortal bowed style. So try and get to the center of uh, that platform you're on. So, Sleeves, you want to back up about five steps. Three, four, five. All right. Keep keep on backing up until you say to stop. Good stop. There we go. Perfect. All right. Great. So here's the way it's going to work. You guys going to shake hands. I'm going to give you the word. You're going to turn around so you're back to back. Then you're going to walk as slowly as the game lets you. When I say fire, you're going to turn around and you have one shot to use. No dodging, no jumping, no prone. You can't get off this thing. You just aim and you fire. To the best of your ability. All right, guys. Shake hands. Turn around so you're back to back. Walk as slowly as the game will let you. Fire. Guys moving, roll. He's moving. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You got him. Hey. 75 million. I better lose. Yeah. I'm on. You bet on losing. You're on my team. What a scumbag. No. No. No. One.
