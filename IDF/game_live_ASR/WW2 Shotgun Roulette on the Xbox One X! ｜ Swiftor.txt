 Hey guys, thank you for watching and I hope you enjoyed the video. What is up, Unibrowls? This is our very first custom game in the full version of World War II. We're playing on the Xbox version. I'm specifically on the Xbox One X. Thank you, Microsoft. And we're playing, as you probably have seen from the hopefully nice looking thumbnail. Shotgun Relay. Shotgun Relay? Hang on. I don't want to look at my shovel. There we go. Players will go to the center of the circle, spin around, fire one shot at random. It's a shotgun. I guess it might kill one in one person, but we'll see. And then we'll go back to the circle. Last two people alive will then face off a one-on-one shotgun mini game. So dudes, why don't you pick a person on the top left? Who do you think will win this match? Pick a person. If you're at the live show, you can bet your points on who you think will win and you'll get more points if you win. Alright, cool. Let's play the game. We have a chance to pick somebody because now we start. Alright, who's going to go first? Let's pick, um, you. Vader. Alright, hang on. Yeah, okay. Well, that means I'm going like super last. Alright, so Vader. Don't need to take the ball. I'm a little bit more in the center, man. Yeah, that's a little bit more to your left. Like one whole step. Like one whole step. Yeah, alright, good enough. Okay, go for a man to spin around, fire a shot. Oh, the jewels. Jewels was the man who put together the bet and what's the thank you he gets. Shotgun. Wow, wow, look at the blood animation. I have never noticed that. It can, it can, it can jeal pretty quickly though. Hey, RWG. It's great. What? It's amazing. Alright, let's see. Blades, you'll be up next. So how do I want to circle? I give it to you. I hope I don't play good enough. You know, I had probably going to die, dude, to be honest. You see shoot, do I just shoot? Whatever you want, man, as long as you spend a couple of times like a cure less one. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, alright. Hold it. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Alright. So if you go look at the blood, there you go. No, I don't want to look at my own blood spill for my body. Thank you very much. Alright. Alright. Whoever's next. Yeah. Alright, my boy. Hey, hey, hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Who's this bro over here that's, uh, set yourself back in the circle money. Alright. That's what. Alright. Go ahead, continue. Oh, that's right where you're standing. Alright. Next. Brainless. Alright, brainless. Give it a go. Oh, wow. Legend killer is out. This is better be. Next. T-bone. Oh, that's crazy. Oh, I got a blood splutter on my screen for that. Yeah, man. Oh, I got a blood splutter. Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Who just walked from one side of the circle to the other? It's me, C-bone. I was getting back in my spot. I couldn't get back in. Everyone had moved. So I was talking about some of my original spots. What would you run over there for like CSI World War II? He's going on. Okay. Distain your spot. Alright, bro. Okay. Okay. Continue, please. Oh, wow. I don't know. I'm going to be. Yep, next. What? You look really confused, man. I know you're getting dizzy, man, around the circle, but you just got to... Oh, not as big. Alright, back in. There you go. To the person scooping stuff out of their bowl, meet yourself. Thanks. Oh, smoke. Alright, next. Oh, God, our recipes gather. Next. Oh, try and gauge a little better where the center of the circle is, guys. There we go. That's perfect right there. Oh, see you. I guess the mods are the target now. Yeah, man. Everyone wants a piece of them. Alright, next. Give me five. There we go. Bite, Sid, number one. So I know a few people right now are thinking like, how come you guys aren't using the insundiari shells? Well, we use them all to make that the thumbnail. Also, I don't think they're fatal anyway. But they may, you know what? They may be. They are. We have very little health, and you're very pretty close. It should be fine. Alright. Alright, next. There you go. Oh. We'll close in the circle a little bit once it gets slow and once down in a while. Oh. Asian boy rip. I forgot Asian boys. Yeah, four mods. Asian boys of mod. Why haven't I forgotten that one? Alright, sorry, buddy. And why don't you do bets? Alright. Oh, that's what you're right about, dude. Hang on, bro. You seem very lost and we're supposed to go. There you go. Just remember the person that was next to you. Oh, brandless. This is out. The mother's crocker. What do you say? Move a crocker. Oh, no. The T-bone is out. Rip. I'm gonna change the view. Alright, there you go. We've had enough at the top. Circle view. Call him. Thank you for something two months in a row. I forgot to pause notifications. We'll do that right after this. Thank you, Cal. I really appreciate that. Vader. Oh. Wait, what happened to the T-bone? He died. You killed him. You killed him. No, that was dead. That's C. No, I can't. Me and Nasty hasn't like, Nasty, that he's dead or Nasty, the player killed him. Nasty, the player. I don't know if he did, man. Alright, we'll do a few more shots. Spank, Tating through your WJ. Oh. Blades is dead. Oh. Oh. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. Alright. Oh. Well, that would have hit me a second time. Oh, wait. Come on down. Does the game look better on the Xbox One X? I haven't done a comparison between Xbox One and Xbox One X, though. I will do a comparison between the X and Pro, though. I think it'll be a fairer matchup. We'll do that later. I'll be a separate video. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hey, it's from my... Okay, let's see. Boy. Alright. Oh, no, I was using him. I was using him. Alright, wait, wait. How many players are left? Let me take a look at the floor. Four players. Move in, guys. Doesn't mean it's super close, but something that's like, you know. You know what? Dude, it's in me a favor. Head on over to the front of the boat again. Let's get two men on each. You know what? Yeah, alright. It's a good idea, right? Well, I mean, if it had the rag doll animation. You know, I can't have everything you want, right? Oh, it's nice work. The spectator view is actually anchored to like the ship and not to like stage moving. Anyway, that's cool. Sweet. Looks good to me. Alright, I have no idea. Let me see your, uh, can't see names of this mode. Alright. Bros for later. Yep, I got it. Bros for life, you'll go first, man. Oh. Oh. Oh. You're a turn, Vayner. Yeah. Okay. Ooh. Ooh. Close. Oh. Oh. Oh. Ah. Oh. Ah. Oh. Ah. Oh. Ah. Oh. Oh. Ah. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. What's your shell count to that, by the way, guys? I have. Plenty. I have 43 shots left. Plenty. Alright. Jeez. No one's dying. We can fix that very soon. Don't worry. Give it a second. There have been some close shots. Go ahead, man. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I had a great view of that. Oh. I guess I did that. Alright, guys, hang on. We're going to switch this up a little bit. You guys are in a pretty good position right now to do what we, uh. What we sometimes do. You guys are going to spin around. Non-stop. When I give the ward, just going to keep on firing shots. Whether you choose to reload or fire immediately, it's up to you. But every moment you're not firing, because someone else may be doing it. We're going to do that until one person dies. Now, obviously the person on this side over here, uh, who's that? Is that Vader? Vader. Yeah. Vader, yeah. He's, he's, uh, I think a little bit of an advantage. Oh, look at that view. So. Alright, gentlemen, start spinning. I'll let you know when to fire. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Ah. Keep on firing now. Stop. Ah. Kilo is dead. Browse for life, took him out. Alright, now it's just you two guys. Now let me think. So now we're more and more to you. Let me try and figure out a different ending mini game. We usually do the, the duel thing. Um, let me think here. We'll be a fun thing to do on the ship. If you guys have ideas, well, me and Spatum out. Um, it's cool. Uh, I got a whole lot of faith. Wait, always. I mean, since it's, since it'd be able to stay the same though. Hold on. Uh, try to hop on the edge of the railings. See who each time they back up. First one fall in the one. Well, I want to involve the shotgun back. You can do the back to back. Yeah, that's, that's the usual though. Alright, um, I'm gonna go back to back. You can do the back to back. Yeah, that's, that's the usual though. Alright, um, I guess we'll just do that one of these. Alright, Vader can you hop on over to his gun. We just gotta do that. I'll think of another, another thing later on. We'll see in the comments. I'm sure you guys got ideas. Alright. The first handshake of the WW2. Some nice views. Yeah, there we go. Or the first, you know, shotgun massage. The chest. Like, got your intro right there. Alright, jump it. If you're not familiar with how this works, let me explain. They're gonna shake hands, then turn around. So they're back to back. When they're back to back, I'll ask them to walk slowly as the game lets them. When I say fire, they're gonna turn around. They can't move, dodge, jump. They turn around, they gotta aim. And they have one shot. If they miss their shot, they just have to wait. They both miss their shots. I get really disappointed in the announcement to do it again. So, here we go. Alright guys, Vary's shaking hands. Turn around so they're back to back. Alright, great. Now, walk as slowly as the game will let you. Everyone else, please be sound. Fire! Oh! Yeah, that's just that first shot. It's a... it's a... it's even an issue. Oh, get the play out of the game. Oh, cool! We gotta play a game now. Alright. Who died that one? I can't even see. Good, mate. So first kill. Alright. Good game, guys. Good game. Congrats to... Congrats to Vader. Bros had most kills. Nothing really matters that much. And I had a big fat donut. GG, if you want to join us for our custom games, you can follow Swift or Alert on Twitter. Turn on notifications.
