 Thanks for pressing like if you enjoyed the video. What is up Unibrow's we're playing some mortal mode. Um, we're on one of the Doom DLC maps, Knockout. Um, and this one will have everyone rock and launcher, which immediately seems like a bad idea. But when you think about it, it's still a really bad idea. So players will spin around one at a time, fire a rocket, likely kill everyone around them, and themselves, and the last two people alive. If there are any, we'll do a duel. So let me go ahead and pick someone to start this off. It's not gonna be me. Um, I'm gonna spin around randomly and stop on... Uh, yeah, it'll be Hulk Hogan. Alright, Hulk, spin around and fire one shot at random. Go for it. Alright, there we go. We'll go clockwise, so Flamers, you're up next, man. Go for it. I swear if you kill me, it's where I'm at. Flamers, you look confused, man. Flamers, you spin around. Oh, wow. You look dead, Flamers. Alright, that's what I meant to say. Alright, you're out here. Hulk, it's your turn next, man. Hulk, Hulk! Alright, there you go. At a rate of high, if I die, you're on it. There you go. Take that ocean. Syngram your next, man. Alright, Sammy, you're gone. Make sure you make sure you fire before you stop spinning, guys. Very important. Cody, you're up next. Alright, next, yeah. You, whoever you are. Shemueling heapsed. I was trying to make sure I was... Scumbag. Just wait, guys. This way it burrows. Wait. Wait. I was watching myself die. Is that okay? Can I at least get that? Alright, next person. Go ahead. Whoever you are. Alright, Cole, I'll be looking through your eyes. Actually, guys, wait a second. I think I can go into Codcaster mode, right? Yeah. Can I do free, free, free, free look, or whatever? Oh, I think you can. Oh, let me over to this set. Wait, bro, wait. Oh, man, remember that I got a Codcaster mode. Alright, I go ahead. Next. Next. Next. Next. I know you guys are out of rockets. Everyone's out, right? No. Next. Next. Alright, you guys are all out, right? We'll have one. Alright, go next if you have one. Alright, cool. I think you guys are all out. Alright, so we've got six players and no winners. So let's figure out how we're going to do this. Leave your rocket launcher equipped. Everyone grab a corner. Everyone crouch. You're not allowed to stand up. Also, you guys should not be right next to each other. That's just a suggestion. So get some distance. Also, I hate this. Oh, God. I hate third person. Alright. Alright, cool. Here's the way it's going to work. You have to melee using your rocket launcher. Last person alive. Winds begin now. Make sure you're still crouching. Make sure you're still crouching, bro. Oh! Alright, whatever. Give that one to peak. Peak wins. Good game, guys. It was fun while people were dying. Alright. It was fun to run out of ammo. Good game, guys. It's alright. When the map editor is out, all my problems will be solved, including ammo limitations. GG. As always, thank you for watching, dudes.
