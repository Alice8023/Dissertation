 Make sure you tap the bell so you never miss a video. It's right next to the sub button. Thanks guys. What is up, you interbrose. I'm from Sniper Relent. Players will take turns spin around in a circle, fire in a shot. Last to people alive, do a duel. I'll be in this one too. So pick one person off the list to the top left. Who do you think is the last person alive? I want like a full list. You can just pick from this one too. Pause the video if you need more time, because we're ready to go. Alright, sweet. So ladies, gents. I think we have some ladies in here. Alright, let me see who's gonna go first. How about we have... I choose you. Hang on, I should worry. Alright. Let's try this again. I choose you. Yeah, there we go. Dap. Yes, be excited, my friend. At the very least, you won't die first. I think. Alright, Dap, go for it. Spin around, flower shot at random, full circles. Great, we're gonna go... Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy, buddy, buddy. Zach, how come you're all... You knew it was your turn first. Gonna have been... Singer's turn.

Oh, wow, wait, hang on, hang on. Hang on. My bad, Dap. You did die first, somehow. I don't know what to say, man. Alright, go ahead. Oh, man. Holy shit. Sparky's out. I can't tell why I'm gonna die soon. That's a spirit. I can't tell it's my friend. Exactly, believe in yourself. Rust piece with the... Rust piece with the... My turn. Hey, man. All I work for nothing. Yep. I'm a lie. I'm a f***er up here. Oh, knives is out. Continue. Sorry, Zach. Nothing. Spin around more times, Zach's time. Whoa, dudes. Spin multiple times. Alright, chill.

No worries, fine. Now we're all level. Alright. Go for it. Oh, this is impossible. It's a collateral away and it happened over here. Maybe I'll get it. I'm sick of that comment. It's gonna...

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't know. I shot two bullets, then. Whoa, these two... Wait, was that two bullets? I don't know. He looked like two bullets. I heard two was shoot. I don't know. I think another term was taken too quickly. It was, I mean, the shots were too close together to be from the same sniper rifle. Continue. I should move closer. Nope. Keep going. Turn is a high short time. All right. Jack, no, no, no. No, pie just went. Didn't he? Oh, I'm good. Okay. All right. You go ahead. All right. No harm done. Except for those. Oh, AJ's out.

All right. So let me explain to folks maybe seeing this for the first time. They're going to shake hands, turn around, stick back to back, and they're going to walk as slow as the game will let them. When I say fire, we'll have a run also silent. They'll turn around and get one shot. There's no dodging, there's no jumping, prone. You turn around, your aim, you fire, you wait. All right, guys. I'm going to go back to the other side of the map. I'm going to go back to the other side of the map. I'm going to go back to the other side of the map. Okay, let's go, I'm going back to the other side of the map. I'm going to go back to the other side of the map. All right, guys. Are Shake hands. Turn around until you're back to back.
