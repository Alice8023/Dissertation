 Thanks for pressing like if you enjoyed the video. What is up Unibrow's are playing some mortal mode. Alright, the spinning looks really cool. Now we can stop. We're good. Alright, so in mortal mode players take turns spinning around and firing a shot at random. Last two people to survive play a mini game. A duel. If you want to bet on who you think is going to win. Pick one person from this list. Pause the video if you need to. Alright, here we go. All kick things off and we'll go clockwise. Good luck. Nothing. That was way too low. Alright, next up is... Blue Jay, go ahead man. Oh no! Blue Jay why? This is our... You can't hit the magic. Kill Blue Jay. Alright, hang on, hang on, hang on guys, hang on. I need to do somebody. Champ, you can be my eyeballs for this one until you die in a way. Go ahead. Next. You guys keep on going one at a time. I won't get over my depression. Oh, skater boys out. Allen you're up. That's not the way it works. What the fuck is this? Everyone carefully aim your gun at Allen. Alright, okay. Alright, cast. I'm sorry, champ. Go ahead, you're next. Three, two, one. Thank God. Oh, stealth. Rip. I feel bad for people who need to be doing this. Oh, I'm sorry. I feel bad for people who need to be doing this. Oh, savage. Alright, next. Oh, I know the feeling like, don't worry man, I'll feel your pain. Chubby. Okay, here we go. Oh, whoa. Oh, maybe the double. Oh, the double. Did I kill somebody? The treacher. He knows man, that's the humble brag. Go ahead. Did they kill someone? Come on, champ. Keep on in the shoot. Don't be able to be able to die. Exactly. Tiglitz, you're my eyes now. Oh, who the hell got hit by like a... Hit marker down. Alright. At least I got two put a press or more. He's the only person who got a double in the game man. Oh, three. Alright, mark is unfortunately I'm now spectating through you. The cursus will have to renown habits you. Go ahead, mark us. Close. Oh, alright. Blue Jays. Blue Jays, I should have spectated you from the start man. You killed me. Go ahead. Oh, I want to return it to you. I'm probably going to be caught. Yep. Oh, alright. Cue Bear, Jay. Congratulations guys. You guys make it to the mini game at the end of the duel. I'd like you guys to head to the south side of the game. Head to the south side of the ship, the back. The south side is the part with the Evidolver Bikes. South. South. South. There we go. I know it's confusing because you think one part is the front part of the horse's back. I get it. Yo! I can't pronounce your name. Thank you for subscribing, dude. Alright guys, yeah, right in the center over there. The diamond is where I want you to be. I want both of you guys in the center of that diamond. Great. Now, very center, please. Very center facing each other. Great. Okay, that works. Alright, so. Here's the way the game will work. You guys are both going to shake hands when I give you the word. You'll turn around so that you're back to back. I'm going to ask you to walk as slowly as the game will let you. And when I yell fire, you'll turn around, you'll aim, and you'll fire one shot. There's no moving, there's no dodging, there's no prone, there's no jumping. You do any of that, you automatically lose. And you only get one shot. Any questions? Good. Shake your hands. Alright, good deal. Turn around so that you're back to back. Walk as slowly as the game will let you. I'm scared. Slower. Shhh. Fire! Whoa! What? Oh no! You both lose. That was terrible, boys. What? No, but you took a second shot. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I won. No, but you took a second shot. That was my fault, I accidentally. No, if they both lose, let me do it. No champ ones. I got double kills. One shot, one kill. You need to wait for me to make a judgment call. I'll see you guys go again. What do I do with that? Bats are canceled. Fun game other way, guys. Fun game other way. I didn't die first. Yeah. As always, thank you for watching dudes. Do me a solid follow me on twitter. Twitter.com forward slash Swift or I totally tweet stuff. Your follow would be amazing.
