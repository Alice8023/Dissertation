 Make sure you tap the bell so you never miss a video. It's right next to the sub button. Thanks guys. What is up, Unibrow's welcome to another game of Snapper Rebleot. This time, mixing up a little bit, each player has both Snapper Rifle Bolt Action, followed by a crossbow with two shots with explosive bolts. So, it's up to each player to choose whether they want to use a crossbow or their Snapper Rifle. What's the downside of the crossbow? You may kill yourself. Let's say I do, I've been around, I fire right there, boom, explode, I die. Snapper Rifle, there's zero chance I'll kill myself, obviously, right? So, anyway, let's decide who's going to go first. Oh, by the way, if you want to guess who's going to win this game, look at the top left. There's a list there. Pick one person off that list. Who do you think is going to win this game? We're going to keep on going, going in the circle. Everyone's going to fire a shot at random until there are two players left. Those two players will face off in a Western style duel. All right, let's see, first player is going to be you. Professional. We're going to go clockwise from you, dude. So, we want to use your Snapper Rifle, your crossbow bolt. You can just get someone if you want, man. So, you're going to spin around a few times and fire at random. No dice. Next up, Patriot. All right, you can keep on going, guys. Don't have to wait for me. If I die, though, I want you to wait about 20 seconds. Oh, sentor is out. Raccoon is out. Roman, make sure your aim is assisted disabled. Oh, battle kit is out. I can get chance. Cambiando, cargador. Oh, you know, that's the risk that comes with you. It's the goddamn explosive crossbow. That was close. Oh, my God. Hang on. Oh, you blew up the Jeep. Wow. Wow, messed up, man. All right. You know what, Yolo? You're a good boy. Good luck. Nothing. You doing it, too? All right. Woo! Tricks and Brat are out. Almost got me there, man. Boomer's taken out the crossbow. Wait. Just wait. Don't take your turn. You got to watch me die. Damn. All right. Hang on. You can continue now. Oh, wait. All those guys need it and die? All right. Oh, I still am it on the ground. What the heck? Yeah, man. Two turns or once. No, we deal. All right. Next, you guy. The guy was next to me. Oh, fuck. Well, shit. Stop. Stop. Stop. Watch you guys to loot everyone else. Try and grab some crossbow bolts. It's loot. Loot. Stay in the same order, though. Keep your order the same. And now form yourself a little square. Let's see who's left. I'm in the bottom of the list here, obviously. Say you got a nightmare, SpongeBob, OPD, and Sting. Sting's got three kills. Well, all right. Continue. Sting your up. I'm out. Yeah, boy, time of Grizzly 26 months. What is up? The longest sub yet. Got 46 months by a few people, man. Some folks say, oh, Sting, is out. He had the most kills and now he's dead. Rocket station. Hang on, guys, once again. Rocket station. Thank you, man. An entire year, dude. I salute you, bro. And a full meter. Premium spin for you guys watching live. Right after this game. And it won't stop. Mike Sims dropping that four months sub. Thank you very much, man. Guys, I really appreciate all these Twitch subscriptions and the cheer and all that stuff. It's what keeps me going, keeps the show going, supports me. Thank you very much, dudes. All right. Let the roll light continue. Oh, shit. Try to get the candle better. Oh, wow. Yeah. No. You were so close, though. You were so close. All right, guys. It's time for the duel. You're not doing it here. How about you head on over to where the in front of the tower? Yeah, stop right there. Yeah. All right, like this area, this is good. Yeah, like you see the tire trail. Yeah. Yeah, there we go. It's working. You have a lot of good stretch of land over here work with. So meet me over there. So you guys know how this works, right? You shake hands, you turn around. You're back to back. I'm going to ask you to walk as slow as the game will let you. And when I say fire, you turn around. And you have one bullet to use. You can't jump. You can't dodge. You just have to aim and fire faster than the other guy. You miss your shot. You just wait until both of you guys use your shots. Freeze and drop in that $10 sub-man. Thank you very much. You're above and beyond. Thank you, dude. Appreciate that. All right, gentlemen, shake hands. Turn around. So you're back to back. Now walk as slowly as that game will let you. Fire! Someone used their shot. I won. Congratulations to SpongeBob. That was good. All right, we're going to do one more round. We're going to force everybody to use their crossbow at the very beginning. You have to use your two crossbow shots before you pull out your snap rifle. No, no one left in the lead. All right, good match. Let's do rounds here. GG. I'm going to show a capable of missing that shot. I don't know if I'm going to get past that. I died. Feels bad. You have another chance, everyone. Crossbow is out. Crossbow required. Keep your crossbow level. Intentionally, I mean it. Not allowed. All right, this sound first player is going to be. Tricks. Where's I standing, all right? Here I guess. Sure. All right, Tricks. Go ahead and spin around. Oh. Nope. We're going to go, let's go counterclockwise. Clockwise and side skills. You're up next. Oh, wow. That was a lot of people dying. All right. Cheese monkey, go ahead. Nightmare. No. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Wow. That was a lot of people dying. All right. Wait. Oh, dude, he said wait. Bro, I missed that kill. Oh. He's banned. He's banned him right now. Kids. All right. Next. Cheese monkey. Cheese monkey. All right. Keep going. Use your final bolt. Next. One more. Uh oh. No. And the winner is you. You. The viewer. All right, cats, look at the winner. You are. I can't see. You know, I'm not. I can't see. You know, I'm not. I'm not. You know, I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. You know, I'm not. You know. I'm not. I'm not. You know, I'm not. I'm not. You know. You know. You know. You know this was the einem rays. Keeping going. We were technically bad. Yes. But what should we do. And we gotta do this. Okay. Yeah, it's. Taking out thelarÄ±n. You know what, a hundred thousand times the battle is going to be jam. We got building fireflies, but all right, it's so dangerous. What do you think, when you turn around?
