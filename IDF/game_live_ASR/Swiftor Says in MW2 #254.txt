 What's up? Welcome to Swiftress says Swiftress says look to your right. It says if they're good looking jump once. A lot of you guys did not jump. Yeah. High standards. All right. All right. How about the person? Look at the look at the person on your left. Maybe they're more attractive. Look at the look on the left. Almost caught you here, bro. But don't worry. Look at that slide. Swiftress says look to your left. All right. If it's Saturday where you live, jump once. Swiftress says. Oh. Oh. Swiftress says you, you. That's what you all look the same over here. Yep. Swiftress says you to come on over. Third guy got away with it. All right. Swiftress says I know it's very tempting, man. Right. You see the person in front of the jump or it's actually Saturday where you are. You too. You want to. All right. We're going to play a week of the, you know, a day of the week game. So this is both of you guys looking at each other. All right. So Swiftress says only you two. When I say. Saturday in any of the language. You guys will. We'll shoot each other. Okay. Once again. I just want to say Saturday in any other language, but English. You guys will fly against each other. Swiftress says everyone else can look over this way. Oh, you guys. I guess you're technically looking at the person that was. Yeah, it's her. We'll let go. All right. All right. Let's see. I don't know many languages. I'm probably going to have to stick to. Stick to Google. Here we go. Let's see here. How about actually what? Chat. Chat. Give me some, some ways to say Saturdays and different languages. Guten Tag. Wow. Soboto. Yes. Guys. Guys. Are you going to get a mess with the game, right? A tater day. Heets a day. Day six. Snoopy day. Saturday. Unfortunately, bro, that was an English. Does that mean I get to come up? No. No. Hang on. We'll do a vote. All right. Hang on. Swiftress says. Brochvy believe a 420 should come back after a dime there. Wow. Wow. We have like four people are voting for you, man. That's it. You guys have no compassion for them. Not at all. You mean people. You are evil. Bro. All right. Sort of says everyone who was crouched. Please get on this vehicle over here. That could be his first game. So it says, oh, it's not his first game. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. You guys do it. No. Okay. I'll show you what we did. I was expecting the next game. What? What is it? What was it? I expected that. I expected that. What? That's what you said. All of you guys, let's do a no mercy game. So this is all of you guys get on top of that green bus over there. Yep. So this is all of you guys who did vote it just to keep him out of the game. No worries. You know, I'm going to respect the votes. Sorry. This is gonna be a very dangerous mini game. Alright, Swift says each of you guys find one partner on top of that bus. Hello. If you have no partner, I'll murder you. I'm good. Alright, Swift says no crouching allowed. Which says you must be standing. No partner, man. Uh... This Swift says just go look at somebody. It's fine. No mercy. You guys, we're gonna try and kindle... ...or kindle kindness in your hearts. Alright, Swift says lock in who you're looking at. As long as you're looking at somebody. Now, here's the way it'll work. When I say any word, that begins with a letter L. It will mail A once. So, you know, onionad does not start with an M. Uh... ...order starts with a Q. Wow, rest in peace. Uh... It was lovely having that guy in the game, though. Sort of says freeze. Sort of says freeze! Sort of says each one of you guys would kill somebody. Come on down. I did not say Swift says. Come on down. Yeah, go! I appreciate that guy. Yeah, go. Alright, sort of says the six... ...the six of you. Sort of says the six of you, please stand. On this brown car right here. Yeah, go! Alright, sort of says everyone else. Laptula or Shullurovitz firing squad time. Gotta be careful. I tricked you. I freaking game froze and I can't do nothing. Uh... what's your name? CP-MAC-14. I died anyway. Sort of says. Uh, you didn't. I mean, what does it rejoin the game? You lucked out. Would you... Would you have shot somebody? Just say no and come back to the game, bro. Just lie to me. Geez. Alright. Who says everyone in this line? Aim at these folks. Hang on. We're missing. Come on out. I still wanna know where you live. It's not for the family. No worries. Alright, hang on. Hang on. Sort of says. You six people look at me. You know what? It turns out you didn't give A420 Mercy. You kill another player. Let's see if you guys can find it in your heart. But forgive each other. If you are willing, the sacrifice yourselves let the other five players live. You'll win to prone now. Just do six. Ben says Swift or Sess. Swift or Sess killed them all. No worries, hey. No one was gonna live. Swift or Sess stop. No one was gonna... So the ones who got stabbed have to stay dead. That is the nature of the game. It's okay. You can hold the grudge against those players for all... all eternity. Hmm. I don't know. Should we? You know what? Sort of says. Let's hold another vote. Let's see if a lesson was learned. Look, I don't have enough names or knowledge. Am I in my memory, sir? But I don't know who died. Fairly and who didn't die, fairly. But sort of says, if you wanna grant Amnesty, every single player who died, I need a unanimous vote. unanimous means every single person has the vote yes. So if everyone goes in the prone, they'll bring every other player back into the game. Swift just says, go ahead. If you'd like to go in the prone and bring everyone else back in, you can. You will not be punished if you don't know. You will not be punished. Come on guys. Come on. Yeah, five... Yeah, Swift just said you dead players. What does a dead player convince them? Convince them. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on! Supra says freeze. Come on. Good job, get out of here. Like I said, you will not be punished for it, but I do need to know your name. What's your name? AA. You understand that everyone else is not coming back into the game because you chose not to. You understand that though, right? I'm trying to get this W. Okay, there we go. There we go, man. The competitive, there we go. There we go. So this is a stand-up block. I'm not going to win it. There we go. I'm dying first, dude. There we go. Swift just says. You're going to follow me. There's too much shame in this area. the area. Let's get out of here. You know, I mean, sometimes it got to be cutthroat if you really want to win. Everyone else that's dead could have been competition. He's right in that respect. All right, we can go to the other side of the map. Yeah. I thought I was in. The lift door says, please let up your backs against this wall over here. So I can't join back to the games. My head restart computer. Just for the pros. Let's see what's your what's your gear attack? CP Mac 14. You I said you could rejoin. This is a rejoin. Okay. Sir, is there a reason why you're not landing it against the wall? Yes, I was the guy that could enjoy. You forgot your Xbox thing after 20 minutes. What was the solution? I just had to restart my game. I don't know how but it worked. So it says, please get the line. All right, great. All right, welcome, guys. So it says, look at me, please. I'm all right. I'm back in. No, we're just rejoining the game. All right. So. So it says jump. So it says crouch. So it says go into prone. Lift or says stand up. And crouch. So it says jump. So it says crouch. Stand. So it says remain crouch. So it says look to your right. Which is as follow the person in front of you. Which is says you. Oh, no, no, no, don't stand up. So it says follow me while remaining crouch. I'm in a little trip here. Anyway, this is real. It's not real. This is all pre-recorded. So it says stop. Freeze. Who says who is this guy who just came in? See me back 14. So it says please go to the line and go in. Bring crouch. There we go. It's making sure, man. All right. So it says continue. Please follow me. Looking good folks. Nice and orderly, but you know, it's just a matter of time before you guys start getting murdered. It's just the way the game goes. Let's wrap this vehicle up. Which is stop. You police stop. Which is everyone else follow person in front of you. Great. All right. So it says if you are not touching the car, which is remain keep the order you're in. Which is as touch the car. Move towards the car. There you go. Keep the order the exact order. There you go. Look at that. Teamwork. Great. So it says face the vehicle. It's going to be a very deadly mini game because it's approximately mine on top. The vehicle is on explode anymore. Don't worry. All right. Here's the way the game's going to work. The last five people get on top of this vehicle. We're going to face each other in an FFA. So if you're getting on top, if you're everyone else, if you're anyone else though, you can survive that that proximity mine. You survive. Ready set go. You worried? No one fell for that. So it says sir, you're not crouching. What's your name, sir? Stone. Stone. I was going to jump up. Sure. Sure, man. Unfortunately, you didn't break a rule, man. Don't just says please crouch with me. So it says your job. We have simply stand right here. That's it. So it says stand right here. And if you're alive with that in this mini game, you're good. I'm sure you'll be completely fine. Don't worry, man. All right. So it says last five people on top of that vehicle die. Go. I caught two people. So it says you with the bright outfit. And so it says you sir right here. Come on down. I only caught two of you. Hey, just your average Joe. I appreciate that, man. So if you guys have memories, I appreciate it. When I was a cod next, there were a lot of really nice people who like that super nice things to me about my old stuff. So I appreciate that stuff. All right. So this is you too. Let's get some names. Cp Mac. And. From. Great. Now over here. There's a. GS Magna. You guys are going to kill each other, but you have to use that gun. So you're going to pick it up and kill the other guy. That's it. So you whoever can pick that up first basically wins, right? You can start running over to the grab it when I fire my gun. Ready set. Yeah. You guys are good. Yeah, somebody just pick. No, who the fuck? No, it must have these spawn. No one picked it up. They gunned the gun. It's spawned. That's all right. You two just really each other. Intemptation of bloodlust. You guys resisted. You guys resisted. Articles to another one of those I say award mini games. So what does this look at each other? We shot. Okay. All right. So what does that one I say any word kill each other any word? Congratulations. So what does please rejoin the players over there? Thank you. All right. Great. So plenty of people alive. Swiftress says follow me. All right. So people always die over because it's very dangerous. But you know what? There's a few enough. So does this way down there, please. Now, if you go or enough of this far enough in the top is truck, you'll be out of the zone. I would feel the most you guys will fit. If not all of you guys. Seriously, deal. So you guys must be standing standing on the... What's the name of the back of the truck trailer? Yeah. Yeah, there we go. Swiftress says you must be standing on top of the trailer. Can't be hanging off, can't be in prone, can't be crouching. Have me standing on it. And that's it. Swiftress says you have 18 seconds. Go. You are, well, you're way too far, man. Heh. Oh, there's so much space up there. All right. Let's play another game mini game. Swiftress says everyone frees. Swiftress says do not move. A muscle. Swiftress says if you have a proximity mine, put it down right now. You have to hit me there. Swiftress has spawned. Turn around and put down your proximity mine, sir. Yep. There we go. Look. It is extremely possible for all of you guys to live. When you hear me fire my gun. I'm telling you the instructions ahead of time. When I fire my gun, you guys have to just go into prone or get off. Or whatever you got to do to stay alive. All right. Swiftress says listen carefully for the gun shot. Swiftress says go. Oh, I didn't say swiftress. Oh, you did. I said it. Oh, yep. Swiftress says if you're one of the three people alive, come on up. So this is? Well, that's a lot of bodies. Oh, there are two players left. Where'd they go? All right. Swiftress says your name is like. Just look at the list over here. It's easier to pull you guys out. Yeah, four texts and lightning. All right. Swiftress says, or are there guys, the folks who? No, no. The person who didn't vote to keep bringing them back is dead, right? AA. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, it's just, it would have been funny if you were still alive. That's all. I was open, I would be. It'd be fun. All right. Swiftress says you two guys go in there. It's finale time. I should kill them with personal. I don't have my, uh, I sent you to it. Oh, Swiftress says I'd like to see your secondary. Beautiful. You guys both have knives. Perfect. All right. Great. Swiftress says both of you guys up over here. Let's make a little bit of a race. All right. I would like to help everyone who's dead. Basically, if you guys fall on the floor, you will lose. It's going to be a race for you guys. We'll just hop from vehicle to vehicle to reach me. The first person to reach me will win the entire game. So Swiftress says you guys wait over here. I'm going to choose where I'm going to be. And all you guys do is, is not touch the floor. You touch the floor. I kill you. The other guy wins. All right. Floor is lava. Yeah. Yeah. Floor is lava. Wow. That would really mess me up there. Go a little bit further. This is pretty good. All right. One more time. I'll tell you to go. I'll do the whole Swiftress thing. You guys simply have to hop from vehicle to vehicle. And touch me. You know what? Make it easier. Stab me when you get to me. May lay me. No throwing knives. And if you do that, you win. For any moment, one of you guys touched the floor. I'll be informed. The game will freeze. You'll die. The other guy will win without stabbing me. Any questions? Get Swiftress says go. Oh, what does this freeze? Wow. You've got to touch the floor. You guys both touched the floor, unfortunately. You touched it first. Oh, it is. It's going. Our winner is Lightning. Congratulations, Lightning. Lightning, what's your shoutout, man? I don't know, man. Shout it to you. Thank you, Matt. Hi, I'm good news. I've got my center chart now. I'll protect you. I'll protect you. Or not. All right. There you go, Lightning. Congrats, man. I run GG guys. I was a lethal game today. But you know, sometimes it just didn't feel like that. Let's remind me now to use a proximity by the end by the end. I saw one. Those ones always got it, man. They like this to the world. I have 10 kills with my mind. Blessed. GG.
