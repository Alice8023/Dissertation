 Thanks for pressing like if you enjoy the video. What's up Unibrow's welcome. We're playing some mortal mode. Everyone's got their attack 45 ready to go. Everyone's gonna stand in different levels over here. It should be fine, fairness wise. So in mortal mode, everyone spins around one at a time, firing a bullet at random. It's kinda like the closest we can get to rush into a light and call a duty in my opinion. So I'll give it a go. So I'm spinning, someone's gonna die. And... Leaper! Rest in peace, Leaper. Everyone make sure they're standing up, you can't crouch. Make sure you're standing up. There we go. When he bets it, he'll have one. Cool, let's go counterclockwise for this one. So Dr. Death, you're up next. You're at 140,000. I hope I don't kill Swing. Oh, alright. Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop. Alright, that's fine. This guy jumped down. Secret place. Try not to fall off next time. Go for it. It's about to get the collateral. Spin for replays. Someone's gonna get a triple collateral. Alright, got a cloud there. Climax. I'm gonna die before my next turn. Oh, kid Cole's down. Wow, at least he's in a warmer place now. Next. I'm kinda sick, because everybody like better on me. No, my God. Monster slap is out. We could beast. Fade, your turn. Exerts. Krusty is out. I like how they fall into the spa or the hot tub. Robert is out. I'm gonna die before my next turn. I was trained to be like, you're gonna kill me off. Alright, my turn. Keep on going. Every time someone shoots my hard scoops, it's... Oh, I'm... You're not sitting there like that. I can't breathe while people are spinning. Next. Don't look down your sights. Oh! Koala. Whoa. You guys are moving along pretty fast here. I don't think I'm in the bet. So it'll be the perfect... If I end up winning or something, it'll be the person before me. Oh, solar visions. Rest in peace. Sorry, buddy. You don't have to kill anybody. Please don't drop from your spot. Stay where you are. Oh, I just saw that. Don't do it. TG is out. Alright, let's see. I'm gonna make sure my gun is low enough to get everybody. No. The doctor's up to you. Not to kill me. Next. I need to fade and scrub our necks. Oh, there we go. Sam's out. Climax. Oh! Bastard! Rip it. Rip it. Oh, man. Alright. Yeah, continue on, continue on, guys. Climax is out. Next. Sorry, you helped me with my hide and seek. Next. Someone needs to hit someone fades. Oh. Oh, brace face is dead. Alright, you're turned death. Well, you're trying to time it? Yeah. Nice job. One out to Michael Russo. Next. Remaining players are scrub, fade. Dr. Death and Seeker plays. I'm running for adults with a win now. I want Tiger. When Exert was shooting, he was scoping in on his gun. I didn't point it out, but he's still alive. Exerts. You can't look down your sights, man. Some people have the aim of the target, so on. I think we'll be able to tell. I'm not really seeing that. Exerts was scoping in before you shot. Yeah. A lot of good that did him. Got locked. She got everybody in the top. Alright, death stop. Death stop. There we go. We're increasing number of bullets fired to two. You don't fire them whenever you want. Wait, everyone aim your gun into the water. Let's do practice. Fire two shots really quickly. Good. Again. One more time. Good. That's exactly like that. Perfect. Alright, death continue. Good. Excellent. That was three. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. He used the next your bullet. Please give it back to him. Thank you. Alright, next. Now we're 499, please. Next. Please didn't even want his attack to do. Man, let's see it in 10. I have an off-seago spicy chicken sandwich. Wait, you're your sandwich's intense? That's what you're talking about. Not the game. Dude, mute your microphone into your sandwich. Oh, alright, that's it. We have our final two players. It's Dr. Death and Seeker plays. Guys, go on the edge of the water. There we go. We're over there. That edge? Yeah. There we go. My true inner self is coming out right now. That's wonderful. Alright, very happy for you in your sandwich. Alright, so guys, let's talk for a second here. You guys are going to do a duel. Here's how the duel works. You guys will both shake hands. You'll turn around so you get back to back. And when I say walk, you know, walk as slowly as the game will let you. And then when I say fire, you're going to turn around a fire with a single bullet. You don't jump. You don't dodge. You don't get prone. You don't get off the ridge. You turn around. You aim and you fire one bullet. You have one shot. Make that one shot count. Alright, guys, please stand up and shake hands. This is not the time for... Alright, there we go. Turn around so that you're back to back, please. Everyone, please remain silent for the duration of the sport of the game. Thank you. Walk as slowly as possible. That's who we're supposed to be. Doctor, you're going to dodge. Shhh. Fire! That's it. Oh, it ripped. It's over. Secret plays. I don't like shushing anybody, but please, if I ask you to be quiet, you've got to like... Because these guys are focused right now. Congratulations, Doctor of Death. I don't know how I want. I don't know how. I'm... Alright. Good game, guys. He just spun around and showed up. Alright, my friend is watching the stream and he heard me talk about my sandwich and it called me fat. Don't you know? Sounds like a great friend. Good game, guys. Hope you enjoyed the video, guys. Follow me on Twitter for updates and special events, what I'm playing, and more.
