 What is up, Unibros? So, as of this time of recording, the Super Bowl is tomorrow, and it'll be the Broncos versus the Panthers, of course. So, we're gonna do a little game of team mortal mode to do a little prediction on who we think might win, or who I think might win. This is the way I'd like predicted. So on the left side over here, we've got seven dedicated Broncos fans, right? Broncos fans, jump up and down if you're Broncos fan. Yeah. All right, I don't think poker kings at Broncos fan, he's just here to chill, or doesn't care. I don't know. All right, and on this side we've got Panthers fans, right? Jump up and down if you're a Panthers fan. I'm only a Camdleton fan, yay. Okay, whatever. Some of these people are clearly here against their will. Anyway, in mortal mode, you spin around, and you fire a shot at random, and someone dies, hopefully someone on the other team. So each team will have one person take a turn, spinning around and firing that shot. The last team to survive is the winner. If we have one player on each side remaining at the end, we'll have them do a duel. So let's end the bets. Oh, let's end the bets. If you're watching this live, you can place the bet. We have at least a little under a million more on the Panthers versus the Broncos. But let's see how that actually turns out. So let's give the underdogs a first give. They've got one less man on their team. We're gonna have more keys. I'd like you to spin first and fire a shot and go for it. No fatalities. Next up, we're gonna have 207. You're up next. Go for it. On slow. Yeah, man. I feel like I gave you a target assist on. Check that out to a seven double check your target assist. Next up master sack. Go for it. All right. Next up. Cut. Wait. No. Oh, she'll right there to a seven. All right. God want to be a three. Go for it. Next. Jazz, your turn. Oh, toxic is out. Rest in peace. Toxic. All right. Next up, it's football guy. All right. Next up, Josh. Next up tag. Oh, team kill. Rest in peace. OTI bear. Next up poker king. Oh, wow. Man. Four. Four Panthers. All right. Next up, it's I didn't go for it. All right. Next up on this side, it's what is it? Respect. I know someone between. Wait, wait, wait, my bad. It's Minecraft. It's term. All right. Minecraft. Go for it. All right. And then this side of resets to two two seven. Go ahead. Okay. Next up. Now it's respect. Go for it. Yo. All right. He's going. Yeah. Go ahead, man. Play. Don't jump next time. Otherwise, I will take your life. That's not part of the game. All right. Next up, it is. Yeah. God, go for it. All right. More keys. We're back to you, man. At this point, hopefully you guys can keep track of who's turn it is. You kind of get it. I don't want to yell at people's names anymore. So I'm just going to go next. So more keys, you're up. Next. Next. Next. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, that's fine. No, that's good. Next. Oh, two seven rip. I don't think the the Broncos have lost a single team member yet. Next. And it's okay. Statistically, these games always even out. Next, we're back to cod want to be cod want to go. Next. Oh, geez. What's going on here? I've not seen this happen before in a team model mode game. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. I think we're back to you, more keys. Next. Next. Next. I'm really proud of you guys. We're going to track your turns. Whoa, whoa, slow down there. Next. It's going to be one of the same time. It's the Panthers turn who goes next. Panthers. That's you guy number three. And went, wait, and went already. Oh, then it's let's make football guy go. Go ahead. Next. Next. Next. Oh, there we go. Lost my cap. Man, next. Next. Yeah, if you're a trick shooter, I guess you'd have an advantage in this game type, but to my knowledge, there's no trick shooters in this game. We've got I've noticed any consistent kills for anyone. Next. Next. Next. Oh, it is rough for team Panthers right now. You don't want to lose any one or two players left in the get on the side. It's really hard for them to kind of like die anyway. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Oh, that's a reject. I don't sure he's dead. There we go. All right. So right now, let's recap. We have five people left on team Broncos and two people left on team Panthers. It's not over yet. We're keeping your positions and let's continue on. Do we lose track of who's going next? All right. Let's start off attack temple. All right. So now back to more keys. I'm starting to know multi kills yet. Oh, wow. Tag temple. It's up to you man. No pressure, but you can kill everybody. I know you can. Your turn, my up ogre king. Oh, mine. Okay. You almost hit me there. Tag temple will simple go after every after every turn. I make a like four quarter comeback. Yeah, man. Next. In my turn. Josh, your turn. We almost got me there. Only reason but in progress. I don't get freaking shot in the face. Oh, yes. Keep your current positions. Oh, wow. The table of training really quickly here. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wasn't it? Didn't he just go? I think tag was supposed to go. Tag go for it. All right. Yeah, Josh, your turn. Tag more keys. Tag. Josh. Tag. More keys. All right. Wow. Can you believe that? You see statistically it always works out. I don't know what it is. I don't know the math behind it. Maybe some other genius out there understands, but whatever reason, it always seems to even out in the end. But our final two players are more keys representing the Broncos and tag temple representing the Panthers. Gentlemen, you guys are going to do a duel to decide the final winner. I'd like you guys to both stand in the center over here. Other orientation, please. Other access. I'd like you guys facing north and south. Is this overkill? North and south. Guess. No, no point. North and south. You guys are facing east and west right now. I want one of you guys facing out over here. What are you guys facing the other direction? There you go. Perfect. Now, here's how this game mode is going to work. Maybe you guys already know how to play. I'm going to explain it anyway. You guys are going to shake hands. And then, yeah, shake hands now. Shake hands. Okay, that was really awkward. All right. Now, turn around. So you're back to back. Now, when I give the word, you're going to walk as slowly as the game lets you. And when I say fire, you will turn around and you can use one shot. You can't jump. You can't prone. You can't run away. You just turn around. You pivot and you fire one shot. There is no dodging whatsoever. You turn around. You aim if you want and you fire. That's all you got. And if you miss, you wait to die. Gentlemen, walk as slowly as possible. Fire! Fire! And, that's it. Panthers with the comeback. Congratulations. Congratulations. I'm not going to kill you. I'm going to run it off myself. That was a strange game. All right. Congratulations. The tag bringing it in for his team. And the prediction is, from the team mortal mode this year, is that the Panthers will win it, although via comeback, clearly. Good game, guys. Good game.
