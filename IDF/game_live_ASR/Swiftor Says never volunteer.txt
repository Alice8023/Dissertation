You said Swiftress says I got out of the car. Well, well, no problem. Swiftress is a hell of a call. Maybe the easiest challenge ever. But it was Bell. Actually, never mind. It won't be easy. But it was Bell. All you gotta do. Is while backwards, jumped with many cars. As you can. I just screwed that up. That's two. And then we're round. Let's use one person. There you need to prime.

Absolutely no need for you to face off against anyone. All right. So does this race? All right. Great. If there's anyone here that just wants to do that for fun, but with the challenge of not being able to turn around, for example, you know, you just go backwards entire time. So it just says. Yeah. That little all you got to do was only without with only looking at your mini map and not you can't turn around for the rest of this in the game. Your job is to get to the right car without touching the ground. Which is if you touch the grounds, this is a one will shoot at you. Right. So I'm going to say I get to you.

Okay. I'll make this look so easy. All right. Phantom. Phantom. Oh, that come on. You will be playing the exact same mini game. You had the benefit of learning from his mistake. His mistake was volunteering. So just as Phantom please go in the yellow car. Yep. All right. So just as begin. Good. Good. I'm a little. Whoa. Whoa. Slow there. All right. Swiftress says everyone please follow me. Swiftress says lap shoulder along the curb of the sidewalk. So we're going to split you guys up the two teams. Swiftress says when I'm running front of you, your team A. All right. Here to last person on teammates. What does you guys are all in teammate? All right. Says you. Up to you are team B. When I fire my gun team B goes here. Team A goes there. Swiftress says sir please come with me. What's your name? Swiftress says Motley please stand on this vehicle. Your challenge will not be as deadly as the previous guys because you only took me a step and you realize you made a mistake. You went. You know, it's like it's a minor infraction. So what just says everyone on the sidewalk. Just please go to the opposite sidewalk. Yep. All right. Great. So does Motley. Your challenge can be super easy, bro. You're going to come stand over here. Come on over. Your job is simply to jump on top of the side. That's it. If you can do it in one try you live. You're all good. I'll do it. I'll do it first to show you guys. It's true how easy it is. That's not. Oh, you're dead. Easy. Easy. Easy. It's easy. All right. Look, Swiftress says if he touches the ground, kill him. Swiftress says Motley. Please try and jump onto that side. We have a chance. You have one shot. You have a chance. You have one shot. Down the street. Oh, he had it. He had it. He had it. No, I had it. He was on the road. He had it. That's tragic. tragic. All right. It was a good shot. All right. Let's get a few more people to do that mini game. Swiftress says first person crouch volunteers. OK. Swiftress says. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. That's great. I think it's not who did it. I forgot about that. Damn. What's your name? Good, sir. Wow. We'll chief. So there's war chief. Don't worry, man. You're forgiven for that snout. Go. Please stand over there. All right. Sam rules apply. Which is war chief. You simply have one try to do it. I believe you can do it, man. Swiftress says begin when you're ready. Jump on that side. He didn't know. Nope. Wait, hang on. Who said they'll do it? Swiftress says if there's anyone that wants to give it a shot with absolutely zero benefit and all the rest. Swiftress says, come on over. I just said he did not do it. Banagobana. You said it. You go. Yeah, banagobanti. I did not do it. Yeah, he's too boring. All right. Let's do this the fairway. Swiftress says if your name is Banna, you're not allowed to crouch for the next 30 seconds. Swiftress says last person to crouch volunteers. Banna was very brave of you. Swiftress Banna, come on down. Yeah. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Oh, no. Yeah. All right. Don't worry. Hang on. Hang on. Banna, I believe you're going to get this done your first try. But Swiftress says I'm going to give Banna, because I'm bullying him. We're giving him three tries total. Swiftress says you are not allowed to shouldn't be hit the floor. Swiftress says you get three tries. And Swiftress says when you, if you complete it on your first try, you get to pick two people to do it. If you get it on your second try, you get to pick one person to do it. You got in your third try, you just get to live. That's your reward. Swiftress says begin. Hey. He's the lead. He's the lead. He's the goal. There we go. All right. Swiftress says. He's the one who's going to choose to be able to do the challenge. So if you're going to get an optimist, get the one here. All right. That's her. All right. So if Banna, please return to the line. You guys are pushing me to do this. Get that take off. Swiftress says begin. Wow. Name please. Swiftress says good job. Oh, so. Siri, come on down. You didn't want shot. You're safe automatically. All right. Look, all you have to do is. All right. Unfortunately, if you miss, you automatically die. Swiftress says good luck. Come on, you got this, bro. Yeah. Oh. Oh. See what you did, Banna. See, do you feel good now? He was saying he was saying you could. No, he wanted me to do it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. Swiftress says freeze. Are y'all standing up, by the way? Swiftress says everyone's standing up. Come on down. Except for Banna. Let's see. Is there even... There's a number of you guys over here. So, just look at the person next to you in their eyes. All right. So, it just says you guys are such good friends. You don't need to talk. You know what you're the other person's thinking. You're best friends. So, it just says you're best friends. You could read each other's thoughts. It reminds me of a story. One time I went to Peru when I was much younger. It was a great trip. But, you know, I was always warned about like, you know, if any things were tourist, you're warned about like, like, shoplift, not shoplift, like, you know, pickpockets and put your, put your valuables somewhere safe. I got this one pocket. Melloy! No! You got this! Buh! Why did you use that? I did not. I did not say it. It says. I won! Bye bye. Bye! Okay. He didn't say it. He said. Buh! He said. He said. He said. He said everyone back out line. So, just stand up. Everyone back to the line. Let's go everybody. So, was everyone back to the line. Hope you remember your team. So, just says. Team A. To this car. So, just says. Team B. To this car. Go. So, just says. Aim at the other vehicle. So, just says. When I say the name of any state in the United States of America, you will flyer at the other vehicle. So, just says. Once that vehicle is blown up, you will run away from your current vehicle in case it's blowing up. Alcatraz. This is going to end badly. Brooklyn. It's 50. But they cry. Erickway. State of the K. Lushing close. New Amsterdam. Miami. What does this stop? What does this stop? What does this run? What does this run? What does this run? What does this run? Oh. Nothing. Lovely. Right. That's... Don't stay at home. Miami is a city. Miami is a city. But they are in Gushon. Thank you everybody. We've got to get to the GTA. Is we the trailer freshened down? Oh, God, we alive. I'll remember that one. No one knows. The only one murdered by a player. Switchers has been. Come on down. Switchers has been. Where are you from? Sorry. Hold on. I'm from the UK. OK. Now I know. That makes sense. All right. Next question. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. All right. I asked where you came from. Switchers says where you going. Switchers says the load. OK. Switchers says everyone please follow me. Oh, here we go. Switchers says freeze. So, here will be your mission. We'll get on this wall. You'll get up here. And that's it. All right, great. Switchers go. Switchers, freeze. Sir. Are you kidding? Sir. Yeah. Did you forget a rule? Uh, no. So, it says look around. Take a guess. What do you think the rule was? We need to jump over here. That is correct. It was on. That was correct. Yes. Switchers says continue. I did. I did. If you missed that, that's all right. Make your way up there. My loadout doesn't matter. This is a bass list. My loadout doesn't actually matter, guys. I'm not competitive. I am easily the worst person here. I say here I mean lobby and all you guys watching. I promise you're all better than me. Although, in one of these days, we'll do some 1v1s in Montuart for a 3. Don't give up. It's not over yet. All right, switchers says you have 10 seconds. Good luck. 10. 9. 8. He's 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1 and a half. 1 and a quarter. 1.1. 1. You didn't get job. Good job. Good job. Good job. It's prox... Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. I got pushed off. Unfortunately, it's what it says you two come in me. Look, bad things happen to good people. It's still doing me. No, man, man. Oh my god. All right, switchers says you two please stand right over here. Which is you two are not a lot to leave the smoke. Two just says melee kill those two players before the smoke clears. Go. Very. That's hard. Two just says melee kill those two players before the smoke clears. Go. Very. That's hard. Two just says melee kill those two players before the smoke clears, go. That was way too late, sir. Yeah. Of course it wasn't worth serious. I was going too late. Let's look for a test here. All right. From the Syrian. Did you see the person you just mailed. Were they visible to you? A leader. They were visible to all of us. If you could see, Does that mean the smoke cleared? Nope. If I'm inside the smoke I can see. I saw him. I'm not near him. This smoke cleared. Trust me. I have to trust you on this one. You have to trust me. Look I'm an honest man. I kill him easily right now. I can actually cliff that into you. Oh it's okay man. Part of this game is me observing and making a call and players can make arguments against it. I mean they don't usually work. It's serious in here. So I trust Serian. So what does everyone follow me? We're going to have Serian a chance to prove himself. It's going to be the same challenge at the beginning of the game. Instead of just completing the challenge, which we've seen done, you'll be timed. Alright so what does that already set? It says go. Great. Great. 10 seconds. Serians got this. Alright good job. That was uh... Actually I think I was like nine seconds. Good job. Yeah well that's what does that Serian please stand over here. Thank you very much Sor. Alright so the Serian pick one player you'd love to face off against that challenge. Who's the worst player here? Yeah I'll take the default skin. Alright good. So what does that say? He picked you. So what does that say? You get to pick someone else instead. I just want to say, I just want to say who you'd like to face off against. Let me face it off against them. I've got it. He switched it up. Really? Wow. Okay. Uh...Sworder says club up. Come with me. That's me. Oh, bad. Well, well, well has a practice. Well, what you got to do is beat nine seconds. If it says... Begin! Good. Good and... Oh. There we go. Alright. Serian gets to live. That was close. You were going really fast over there. Yeah, I was almost dead Serian. Alright great. Swiftress says please follow me. Swiftress says two single file lines in front of these two pay phones. Some make a call. Here's the way the game will work. The people in front of the line will melee the phone and run to the back of the line. Swiftress says both lines will do this until I sit and stop. Swiftress says if you kill another player by mistake, you will die. Swiftress says if you spend too much time at the phone, I will kill you myself. Swiftress says begin! Okay, the phone goes to the back of the line. Careful. Careful! I'm really surprised no one's dead yet. Yeah. If we're punching the wall, it's not the phone. So what's the stop? Yeah. What the game is like that. All you need to do is wait. I knew a kill was coming. Alright, Jack. You made a mistake. Who'd you kill? Who'd you kill? Who died there? Who's the man? Who's the man? Who can give him a parkour challenge? Who's the one-v-one against? I'll let you pick. I think a one-v-one versus a Syrian. Alright, so does a Syrian come on over? Please, Jack, I believe in you, Jack. Swiftress says both of you guys come into the tunnel here. You both messed up. You get a fair one-v-one now. Let's properly test that plot all of them. If you guys want to watch, you guys can come sit down on the sidewalk over here. Swiftress says you three, get in the tunnel. I didn't say Swiftress says oh. Oh, no, no, that's not a one-v-one. It's a four-v-one. It's a Syrian one-v-one. Swiftress says the rest of you guys come stand over here to watch. Swiftress says you guys can have the tables. Five people. I'll let the turn this into a three-v-three. Just kidding, no. I would like to volunteer. I'm just kidding. Toad is a stop. Where are you? Toad is a stop. Oh, he's a stop. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Just, just, oh my god. He just crab-ha– he just crab-ha– he just crabs-ha– it's Swiftress says unload. The Syrian brothers, the Syrian brothers. The Syrian brothers. He wanted to kill Syrian brothers. How Syrian brothers? That was the way to go out. Definitely on purpose. Muscle memory. Keep the fizz. I couldn't hear you can look at the shots that someone teased. We're not the five players. What does that follow me? What does that no gunfire will be allowed? This mini game will have to be strategic. That can be a race. This is going to be what's the word? You need a plan. You need a plan. That's a proxy, my mind. The fifth or says the last two people to get on the car and live will die, which is begin. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's get on the car. One person on. Wow, that was interesting. No one died. Well, I know who the last person was. Sorry, excuse me. You know, being cautious was the play. But man, I didn't even trigger the proxy, my mind, huh? Are there four of you that challenge one more time? This will be a lot simpler. It's right there. To what you says, last person to get on this police car dies. Go. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. What are you doing? I'm a controller. Oh, that was so close. I was looking near that, though. We got it first. I was looking at it first. I don't even get it. I would just try to stab it out. Yeah. Maybe it's going to be a little matter finale. Maybe it's going to be a little matter. My controller has all got swapped. Max was original. He was right at it. It was a dolphin dive. That's fair. I mean, this is... Everyone here has used to play in Monwar for a third raid. Their binds may not have carried over, depending on how they... They had the game configured. Switcher says both of you guys on top of the white van. Here are the rules. Switcher says once the white van is on fire, you're allowed to get off the van. Once you've made contact with the floor, you're allowed to shoot the other player. There we go. I tried it before. Oh! There we go! That was great. I'm glad you had a better jump. Turn around. About to be the fight. It's only air. Midair kill. Good job. I'm going to go back. There we go. That was great. That was great. Great. I'm going to go back. That was great. Good job. That was a good one. Violet you did a great job for a second place. And congratulations. What's your shoutout? Thank you. I'm going to shout out my girlfriend as always. It's my normal shoutout. There we go. All right. Good stuff. Thank you. Actually. Cheers. Great game, guys. And later. Cheers. We'll be playing.
