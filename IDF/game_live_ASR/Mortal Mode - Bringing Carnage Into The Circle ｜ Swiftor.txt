You're good. Great. In a moment I asked both of you to walk as slowly as possible. And when I say fire, you're going to turn around. You're going to fire a single shot. Use that shot wisely. So gentlemen, walk as slowly as you can. Fire! No! Oh, you both missed! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. All right, we're going to try this again. We're going to try this again. All right, all right.

That was close. I lose every time with that. Yeah, that's the rough one. I lose every single time when it comes to that. I think I've won like once in my life if that. I'll always be through a final round though. Yo, dude. You've got some good shots. Let's survive. Me and Dive in the first round. Spin it around in circles. Oh, he aimed. Oh, it's because I was wearing my jacket around my waist. He nearly missed you though. That's right, man. All right, good game, guys. Nice to talk.
