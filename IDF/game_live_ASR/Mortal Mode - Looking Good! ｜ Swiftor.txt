 Thanks for pressing like if you enjoyed the video. What's up, me and Abros! Welcome to a game of mortal mode! On the best mortal mode map, Sea Town. Alright, you guys can stop spinning now. Everyone said it's gonna be a set 2-10, the maximum in Modern Warfare 3. They'll be spinning around one of the time firing a single bullet. This bullet might hit somebody. So, the last two people to survive will play a mini-game together. And the winner of that mini-game will be the winner of the game. If you'd like to play a log, choose one person from this list and the left side of the screen. Who do you think is gonna win? I'm not on this list for whatever reason. I'm just not there, but pick somebody else. Alright, let's begin. I'll start it off. I'll spin around. I'll close my eyes just for fun. No one died. We'll go counterclockwise. So, infinity, you're up next, man. Spin around and fire. Please not look down and please do not try and avoid the bullet. Alright, next. Oh jeez, how bizarre it is, dead. Snip? Alright, next is dark one. Remember, don't look down to your sights. Ash. Next. I swear. There you go. I love you, man. I love everyone. You picked the wrong class, buddy. Ace, your turn. What? What? Alright, next up. Dragon. Next up, Pac-Man. Crossrail. Alright, Nito. More keys. Company. Cheese. Your key shooters should still be enough to kill somebody. Noon. We can't disable target assist mid-game. You have to do that when you're outside the menu. Too much of a pain. Spark. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Alright, we got one person killed. That sucks. Let's do a mini-game. Everyone's spin around. Everyone's spin. Fire one bullet now. Oh my god. Oracle, Ace, and Cheese are out. Good job, everyone. Let's resume. Wait. You are done. Alright, infinity to your turn. Just be ready when I call you. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. No, don't crouch. You crouch again. I will shoot you in the head. Take your bullet like a man. Next. Next. Next. Alright. We're increasing now to two shots, like so. Oh my god. Infinity to your turn. Maybe you want to aim your gun a little bit lower next time. Noon is dead. Yep, we're at it. Oh wow. A bullet for each person. Not bad, dark one. Ash and Neeta are gone. Dragon? Oh, infinity's gone. Now things are getting interesting. More keys. Took too long to fire two shots. Next time, do it faster. Spark your turn. Alright, my turn. Oh. Dark one. Oh wow. Dark one's on fire. Snip is out. Dragon go for it. Spark. Oh, more keys is out. Alright, now my turn. Good job, guys. Keep on going. Close. Oh, Spark is out. He was a threat. Come on. Come on. War left. Oh, I thought I was making a make it. Alright. Alright, alright. Hang on, boys. Hang on. And to the world, we'll go. Alright. Alright, gentlemen. Continue. I'm dead, boys. I wasn't part of the bet, but you know. It feels bad to die. Oh! Valid Dragon's out. Remaining players are. Fade 1997. Dark one. Alright, gentlemen. Sign for duel. Do both of your players not play a duel? Or do I have to explain it again? Alright, good. Alright, guys. Position yourself. So where the chickens are for the duel. Prepare yourselves. Oh, wow. Oh, you know what? I came back on the well. I came back on the well. I came back on the well. I came back on the well. I came back on the well. Back on the well. Up on the well, please. Let's do the duel on the rim. Alright. There you go. Alright, guys. Meet each other on the well, please. So that you're face to face. Hey, guys. Meet each other. Face to face. Like, right. Skin is rubbing against each other. I want you guys close. Nice and close. Alright, cool. Hang on, let me. Let me position the camera. Make it look nice and sexy. Alright, cool. Now that you've shaken hands, please. Back to back to each other. Now don't do anything yet. I'm going to explain on this game works to the, to find folks watching from home. These players, both, both fade. And why don't you even forget their names? Am I bad, yes. Anyway, they're going to walk as slowly as the game will let them. When I say fire, they're going to turn around. Aim and fire, a single bullet. They can't move from their spots. They can't go into prone. They can't dodge the bullet. This is like an old-timey duel, you know, where they walk. Away from each other, they turn around. They fire a shot. I'm going to throw a shot. I'm going to throw a shot. I'm going to throw a shot. I'm going to throw a shot. I'm going to throw a shot. They fire a shot. All right. So, gentlemen, walk as slowly as the game will let you. It's dark versus fade. Complete silence, please. Fire! Oh! And fade gets it. Dark one fired first, but he missed. A classic story of the tortoise in the hair. Close though. Oh, we're finding a blonde. Oh, yeah. I'm really getting these shots. Congratulations. Fade, you're the winner. All right, guys. Congratulations. If you bet on fade, you win that bet.
