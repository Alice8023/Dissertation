 Thanks for pressing like if you enjoyed the video. What is up, Unibrow's Let's Play some mortal mode. From this list of players who do you think will be the last to survive, players will be spinning around in circle firing, one shot at random. When we have two players left, they'll then do a duel. Be like a little mini-game. Alright, here we go guys. I'll start it off. Good luck everyone. After that we'll go counter-clockwise. No...no deaths. Alright, a person to my right, your next, but give me a second dude. Don't go just yet. There we go. That's got and go for it. It usually takes... Wow. Pokey's out. Alright, next. Dark wolf is out. Next. Oh, kid fits is gone. What? Shrock is out. Oh, this is a pretty bloody first round. Wow. Now if Cavaldy's next, that'd be hilarious. Go ahead, Carlos. I'm never gonna die. No! Oh man. Swift. I'm aiming for you. Don't look down your sights, guys. I won't. It's my turn. Nothing. Keep on going. Oh, if that's going to take that bullet for me, man. Next. Next. Nitro is out. This is pretty bloody. Some of you guys are definitely not spinning full speed just so you know. Nothing. Oh, now that's out. I didn't see that death though. Carlos. Now like how the damage is right here, bro. Oh, lane is out. My turn. Oh, lane is out. My turn once again. Not a single kill, but you know what? That doesn't matter. As long as you live, number of kills you get. Doesn't matter at all until the end. What about survival? That's right. Oh. Let's get up the bullet. It does not fly in your direction. Yeah, go for it, man. Damn it. Zero. I saw a water just going to like splash up. Yeah, man. It's growling. You spin. Let me know that bullet's coming. Jamie. I want to hit slipper so bad. Kill me. There you go. Get your revenge. Kill me. I'm trying. What do you want to kill or do you want to get killed, man? Make up your mind. I want to kill. All right, then. Oh. Darkwing with the first double of the match. So much revenge. All right, Jamie, go for it. All right, my turn. Somebody killed Darkwing. Mark is still at it. Somebody killed Darkwing. And so if. Please. We're going. We're going. I think I was safe. The devil's here. Cool. I can everything the time. Dude. The name just, just demands it. Oh, my biggest threat removed. Thank you, Darkwing. All right, this four of us left. Let's do my going for a bit. Then we'll move in. No, kill Darkwing. That was close. Top four boys. Top four boys. Yeah, that one I'm pretty poor at, but you never know. You never know. I've definitely won like a handful of moral modes in the past, but that's like over the course of like six years. Oh. Maybe seven years actually. I'm not going to be a little bit more. Yeah, that one. I'm pretty poor at, but you never know. Oh. Or maybe seven years actually. Oh, that came so close. You definitely just said that you can hit your vines. I've been created. One more rotation. Then we'll start moving in. Connecting. All right, last one that we move in. All right, everyone a little bit closer. That good. Darkwing. You're welcome to the party. There we go. This is pretty good. All right, Marcus, continue. I am so lucky. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. What was with Marcus? Almost look like you were you were targeting me, bro. I think you should randomize your starting spot, homie. All right, go for it. Marcus got that bloodless for me. Not like last time when you shot like what? You shot? You all right? This is pretty tense. You get to breathe. Wait, did I shoot? You did not shoot. No, my screen. Oh, my screen. Oh my god, somebody died. Patience. Oh, quiz out. You cable. Table you are my best friend. Thank you. Fence three remain. All right, here we go. No, no patience. Now kill a swift door. Whoa. That was close, Marcus. I know, man. You know, it's when you're high profile, you're a target. Or just you know, devilishly high and some you know. I'm having really drink under so much ammo. So much. Come on. Head swift door. My next one I'm here. This one. I'm close. I'm close. That didn't help. Oh, and I've already missed. Oh, come on. Don't give me. I'll give you. She's laying with the sub. She's laying four. I got a lot of cheeseballs in Germany. A lot of cheese. Oh, who would have guessed me and Marcus? Marcus, please. Planted gentleman. You know, this is just, you know, is meant to be. Marcus is me and you. All right, let me see here. All right, cable. I'm going to leave the formalities to you. You go with that. All right, yeah. All right. All right. I'm shaking very slowly. All right. All right, that's good. I turn around and walk very slow until they stop and shoot. At they stop, you turn around and shoot. One shot. No jumping. Stop. Wait, wait. Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on. This is very confusing. Let's start over again. All you got to do is after you say lock, walk as slowly as possible, you just yell, shoot, and that'll be our cue to go. Because stop and turn around and lots of those are weird extra additions. So let's try one more time. I'm glad Marcus didn't shoot me in the back when he said stop, too. I was like, uh, are you going to shoot me now? All right, all right. All right, all right. All right, Caval go for it. All right, turn around and walk forward very slowly. Five really slow. Five percent. Ah! Dude, I like literally like, uh, this just killed me, man. I pressed that by mistake. Ah! Wait, what did he press? No, like, it hit my lap. I was turning, uh, whatever. I lost. Well done, Marcus. Well done. Ah! Oh, God dang it right now. Ah, all right. Good game, guys. Well played. And thank you, Caval, for the ceremonies. All right, GG. Hope you enjoyed the video, guys. If you enjoyed it, drop a like. And if you're on Snapchat, add me.
