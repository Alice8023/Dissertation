 Swift gooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 7 is head Well, what is up dudes! Let's get over some some some roll-lack This is gonna be a little bit different than the other ones we're in black ops to of course We're on carrier, but I need everyone to kind of set up. So get press start go to options and set your looks sensitivity To maximum, which is 14 And also set your target assist to disabled Well, you're done with that to spin around in a circle. Well, I'm trying to choose this course. This is trippy. I see PG as a way he's going to die. All right. My eyes can get in my way. All right, everyone's looking good. Great. Here's the way it's going to work, boys. You have a shotgun as your secondary or primary. Probably primary. So the way it's going to work is one time you go to the center. You're going to spin around with your shotty. And when you kill someone, if you get a kill, you take out your crossbow, you get to do it one more time. That's the way it's going to work. All right, it's like a bonus. It's everyone dying to meet you with a crossbow, you know? That's a bonus. All right. So let's see who's going first. It'll be closing my eyes. It's been around. The guy jumping around that doesn't really deserve it. The last Asian. Congratulations. Why last Asian? He's so lucky. All right, all right, all right. Last Asian boy, go ahead, pull up that shotty.
