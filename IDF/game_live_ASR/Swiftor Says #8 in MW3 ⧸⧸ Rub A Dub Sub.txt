 What's up everyone we'll play in Swiftress says on sub base. Footress says come up to the fence over here. Look at those subs. I have a lot of good subs. Great. Swiftress says. Whoa. What have you done? What have you done? That's a wrong button and I tried scrolling in the lane and it worked. How did you do that? I heard the click. Yeah, I accidentally pressed my Fragrinade button and I kept holding it trying to scroll the way and it didn't work. I didn't hear the explosion. Did anyone else? I didn't know it. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Swiftress says, good moon, read you on the game. Read you on the game. It's not time to die yet. The time to die is like 20 seconds. Hang on. Let me touch this out. Oh no. T. Allen, can you not fly like that? And it's great. I can touch this. Perfect. Perfect. All right. We're going to play a little game. Oh, this is beautiful. So. The Allen, you looking good today. Swiftress says everyone jump on top of the fence to give yourselves a fair, a fair shot at this one. Um, I have a problem. I feel like I'm going out of bail. You're going to have to try different. You'll be fine. It is very possible to do this next mini game without dying immediately. Dying later, well, that's an entirely different story. There's no space for us. Yeah, I've noticed that I have to cleanse my souls. Swiftress says, please stand on the fence. Wait, 17. Is that a fence you're standing on? That's a ladder, bro. Let's fix it. There we go. Maybe. Maybe I can squeeze your. I will say my patience today is probably like supremely high after like managing many, many hours of my kid yesterday. A theme park. Anyway, great. Everyone's on the part. At the end of the fence. Oh, yeah. Sorry. You see, dude, you see there's no room on the fence. What are you doing? You're literally not what you do that you're like. You're like from the lake. You're on the fence. Go to the other way. Damn it. Oh, my God. There is another fence. Holy crap. Oh, here we go. What I say about patience, that's God. Great. Okay, cool. Now, there are, you can touch the submarine. A lot of spots for looking at your mini map without being out of bounds. Over here to the side, too, also works. We'll fit like all of you guys. I think it might. But if you're not touching the submarine, you will be in trouble. Ready, set, go. Swift or says, go. You must be touching the sub directly. You can't be touching someone else that's touching the sub. There's plenty of stuff to go. I think I'm touching. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Guys, there is so much. There is so much submarine over there. I got a push out of that. I got a push out of that. Two, right. Hang on. I will address this in 10 seconds. So it says you have 10 seconds to touch the submarine. If you're watching me, there is an entire side of the submarine you can touch safely. So it says you have five seconds, five. Four. Are we touching it? I do. I'm touching it. One, two. Swift or says, freeze. Oh, my goodness. I don't know. Let's see here. I think we're all pushed on this left side. I don't think we're touching it. Andy is holding it. I keep bouncing off when I go close to it. I just burst out. I'm bouncing off too. Yeah, I be too. Great. All you guys touched it. All right. Let's just assume. Well, and how can you guys are not touching the submarine? Why? Because you're dead. No. You do not get to escape. Swift says both of you come back into the game for your punishment. Leave and rejoin. All right. This man was moving. Listen, bro. Listen, stop it now. It's in the, you're breaking the rules. You're fine. Actually. Swift, I promise he just pushed me out. I know. Who's this? Who's this? I'm going to get to your name. Swift, it's me. That would, this guy literally just came out of nowhere and pushed me out. I got pushed out too. I got pushed out. Swift says you too. Come with me, guys. Oh, I'm going to settle this. I'm going to settle this. I'm going to settle this. I'm going to settle this. I'm going to settle this. I'm going to settle this. I'm going to settle this. I'm going to settle this. Look, I'm not a monster. I'm going to settle this in a fair, you know, in a fair way. Swift says both of you guys hop on here. Henry, if I survive, I will kill you. What did I do? I've been here a little push me out. Swift says both of you guys stand over here in this corner. Say again, please. Swift says stand at this corner over here. Swift says face to submarine. All right, great. Listen. The first one of you to touch a submarine lives. Go. Well, fuck. I'm going to smash that man and you can go back. So just go touch some rain. I did not say Swift says. All right, do I have our two other offenders back in? Hackett'sack, Bell, you on your way? I'm cranking. I'm cranking the PS4 here. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. If you guys like Bell, maybe, oh, oh, oh, oh, we're going to a new PlayStation, please. I don't know, man. You cranking on these. All right. Swift says. I may play a different match. So just hackettack. Here is your challenge, bro. So just hackettack. Follow me. I failed. Let me listen. All right. So just as everyone else. So just as your backs to the wall over here, please. So just as you're touching the submarine, I want you back over here. You need to watch what's going on. Hackettack. You've got the easiest challenge in the world. This is supposed to be a race, but Bell's not here. So this is going to be a demonstration. Well, it will almost definitely be a future minigames. Everyone else pay attention. Minty. Yes, sir. Did you disconnect earlier? I did not disconnect. I seen you shoot over there and I seen the red ping. No worries. Does Megan know where he's? No worries. Conversation over. All right. So just as hackettack. All you have to do, man, is swim around that buoy over there and come back. So just as if you can do that. Yeah, swim around it. So I'm around it and you're good. So just as go whenever you want. That's free V bucks over there. Free bucks. And V bucks. V bucks. Oh. All right. It's very far out there apparently. All right, P. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, he was definitely dead. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. So just as hackettack rejoin the game. Yes. I'm back. All right, great. So at this point, is there anyone that should be dead? Yes. Andy. Sorry, bro. Or is it no? Or is it Henry? Henry, you dead. Henry is dead. Henry is dead. Henry is dead. Henry is dead. Henry is dead. Henry is dead. Henry is in his name. He's all right. All right, great. Henry pushed me up the sub. I hope he dies next. I didn't pull out the game. All right. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. And the guy who died is in trouble. It was Henry. I saw it. Funny rapids. And David Jesus. We'll come back up now. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. So what does he, that diving lover does not make you more of all the switches. What's your name? Come on up. We come on up. What about the right now? All right. Everyone come up. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. He caught me. I was like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. This is Evo. Come with me, man. Team Money, please, me your microphone. I just had a love lock. Oh, oh, oh. All right. So, Evo, you try to evade being caught by diving like 500 feet under the sea, right? I mean, that, that, that, yeah. Good time. All right. Great. So, here's a challenge, man. We will dive again. But your goal will be to tickle every single foot. That, that's, that's pretty weird. If you want, if you do, you don't have to do it. He'll just tickle your toes right now. So, by, okay. You're here to the game. Good. Good. So, if you just say as what you'll do is you're just going to swim under their feet. That's what I mean, man. You just swim under every single pair of feet and you're going to come up alive at the end. Or you won't. So, if the size of one shoulder to shoulder. So, if this has had to the beginning of the line. Sir, Swift or says had to the beginning of the line. Oh. You are not going to live very long. You're going to pass this again. No. You're not going to feel like we had some issues here. All right. So, all you got to do, man, is swim under their feet and then come up at the end. That's it. All right. Swift or says begin. Let me take out my camera for this and I'll see you some feet picks. Oh, fine. What the, that's tickled. All right. I'm sure it's forcing, man. Who are nowhere near their feet, bro. I was right under it. No, you're not. No, you're not. You're not anything. Hang on. Hang on. Is the easy way to solve this? Look. We have another pull-up. Everyone watching the stream live. Was he on their feet? Or was he way below? Was it, did he do that correctly yesterday now? I want to vote. I will tick-talk YouTube Twitch, everyone can vote. My chat saw it. He did not tickle me Elmo. Your chat better get to my chat and vote for you. Yes, real quick. It's gonna be a quick game for you, man. Well, Joe, I only have one person watching. I was thinking, everyone starts somewhere, man. I started one of your. Everyone started one viewer. That's how it goes. No, I know. That would be the same goal. I think I'm shadowed, man. I'm just on tick-talk and normally I'd be getting a good talk. Yeah, yeah, good talk. All right. I can't believe how close this is. I did not see sex sometimes. I did not see sex sometimes. All right. Swift or Sess, we're on backup. Where's the block? Circle. Okay, that's not perfect. I didn't hear it. Swift or Sess, please come back up. One other time. One other time. There's no water again. Yeah, I'm just gonna. I'm just gonna get a little water. I'm gonna get a stock. Wait, wait, I'm gonna drown. Usually I'll have a ladder. I'm gonna try to use it as shantone. It's not a clown car. I'm just gonna do water. Big feed might be a clown car. All right, great. Swift or Sess, please follow me to the south. Actually, over here. Yes, what does this over here? This port over here. East stock. Swift or Sess go as far east as you can on this stock. I keep on forgetting to reduce the health much lower than it should be. Right now you guys all have 50 health, but most of you also have EOD. So a single proximity mine will not kill you. That's bad. Bad for business. Not good for you. Bad for business. So to resolve that. Oh, no. Too many of you are alive. I always have these intrusive thoughts. It's too early. I can't have a truce of thoughts until like 20 minutes of the game. This is too early. 20 minute rule. I've got an idea. That's not good. Last person touched me dies. Go. Well, I heard like 60 footsteps. I thought you were going to go ready fast. Say, Tatek, demon. You're not from the US, right? No, okay. Say, Tatek, can we hear your voice, man? Or are you from? All right. Say, Tatek. In the US, we once had this show, all the American Gladiators. It was basically a show where players had to compete against these other like drugged up athletes. And they almost always lost. You will have the curtain. No, there's one challenge you have to kind of do. So just follow me. Say, Tatek. Your goal. Your goal. We'll be to start over here. And your job will be to go from barrier to barrier. Until you start to final barrier over here in safety. All the wild players will be able to fly or bullets at you. Yes. I don't know if you'll survive this. I don't think you will. But if you can figure it out, you get to live. Don't shoot unless you have a clear shot. You can do the final line. Go ahead and throw. I'm trying to find a spot. I'm going to clear shot. Turn them up. Please start behind this barrier right over here. I think you're going to die. I don't know if there's a way to do this. If you can take a few hits, maybe you can. Say the word swift. I got his head. What? No. What are you doing? Guys, look. I highly recommend you can dive immediately. I highly recommend you say hit him for the first one, man. I could see him still. I could see him still. I could see him still. Listen. Swift says you cannot intentionally try and actually. Swift says all of you guys are the barrier. I want to see if there's penetration. All right. Good. No penetration. No reasonable penetration. Good. We're done. Swift just stop. Okay. Great. That's your bullet. Just keep moving. Admit. You know what? You know what? I'm going to stand up over here, man. Don't kill me. All right. Swift is demon. Prouch. Swift is back up a little bit. I'm trying to help you out, man. By help you, I mean, I want this to be some good content. Swift says, begin. That's good. One more barrier. You make one more barrier. You live. You win. I want to see the next one. Oh, my God. Dude, I will say the fact we survived even once, I think, was very impressive. It was too much. Which is as he said, relax. I'll tell him in that. Okay. That's a big jump to that second barrier. All right. Now let's play the game for real. Last person cuts. We dies. Oh. That's the game. That was the best game. I didn't catch them. I didn't catch them. Oh, you got so lucky, bro. Wait, you guys all know who it was? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Swift says, write them out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's where our bandit move is I'm good. I have some interaction. I have some interaction. Because I have some interaction. Yeah. So I should see man. Look. The fact that St. Tatted got to what Meyer means is a possible mission. All right. Say it real for five. Swift says. I don't know. I see some people asking us all answer now. If you're looking to join our game, just join our discord server. It's, it's, it's, it's my, it's my description, it's my bio discord.gg4tsus with your, or, uh, you're all, I'll paste it right here in the chat. It happened. Oh, yeah, there you're back, man. So I'll get dude. So you did, you did a good man. He hit the first barrier. All right. Great. Anyway, uh, say to any of you can mute it again, man. I get, I got to go. All right. Last person touched me does. No, uh, the third time the charm. So what does this team money come on down? Yeah. I'm milking this command so hard. You know what? All right. Team money. Yeah. I'm going to give you easy mode. You know, you didn't move that much. I saw you move, but so I'm going to do free man is I'm going to throw it out to smoke. Let me say it says go. And so you'll have the smoke to work with. It'll be working for you. All right, man. Okay. So it says team money can go whenever you'd like. Start crouch. Oh, trust me. So it says you can go whenever you'd like. I recommend waiting for my, uh, my, my smoke. So it says you guys, smoke will be up. Do not shoot me. I'm over here. Okay. You're kind of blending. So it says you know, you know, you're not over there. You're not over there. You're not over there. You're not over there. You're not over there. You're not over there. You're not over there. All right. Either one thing. The players are getting worse. You guys are getting better. I don't know what's going on. It's just, uh, all right. Um, we should actually probably do a mini game. Huh? I'm thinking really easier real simple. Oh, no. Oh, no. That should kill you guys. Well, you really want to go guys. I really don't want tons of people to die here. One or two or three are good for a laugh. Any more than that. It's going to reduce my options for murder later on. All right. So listen, you don't look really simple. All you got to do is no, it's not a race. Just touch me with the next three minutes. Go. I want to love that. Good. Very good. Very good. Very good. All right. I'm done trying that when I saw it. Let's see how far I can go. Swiftress has go. It's always so much. Yeah. Thank you. I'll take over. Overkill over. Overkill over. Overkill over. Your sacrifice will not be forgotten for at least 20 more seconds. Swiftress says follow me. Thank you. I'm going to go. There's a lot of all that went into that. All right. Swiftress says, lap shoulder shoulder. Andy, what's up? Uh, excuse me. You're here. I'll just as I like it a little extra little show on this side, please. It's part of the game. I don't know, but we're not left. So you all need to figure it out. Who's reaching and clear? I threw the window. If you're running in front of me, Ray sir, you're not lap shoulder shoulders. So sorry, buddy. And there's no room. I wouldn't make room. I'll be a fuck. I didn't see it. All right. Swiftress says, I believe there is a very limited amount of space in this little hidey hole over here. So it says to be considered legally in here, both of your feet must be standing on the metal plating inside. Now, it says you're allowed to go in there. Once I say the name of a food that contains fish, that's it. Any kind of fish product. Okay. Swiftress says the game has begun. Listen closely. Oh, well, gum. Toothpaste. Not a food. That would be nasty. Yeah. Fish food. Good. Fish flavor. Toothpaste. Apple pie. Shepherds pie. Baby shark. Who says hang on? Okay. And Bell. Just both of you guys have to go down. All right. Now hang on. Now. I don't know. Maybe delicious. I don't want eating a baby shark would be hugely immortal. I'm not immortal. Immoral. That's, you know, it's like the equivalent of eating like, feel which unfortunately is really delicious. Man's messed up. Anyway, baby shark is in fact not a food per se. It's sharp. But baby shark was coolly reference to what? Yeah. Baby deer. People eat baby. The other comment. Pop quiz. Pop quiz. Swiftress says what do cannibals eat? People. That's right. You two. No. No. No, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't kill 5 people. It happens to the best. Me too. I'm sorry. Oh man. It's got me in the mood for sushi. Maybe shark sushi. That's why people stuff fire. I know. I'm I am. Everyone fit inside. Oh man. I said you didn't have to say Swiss to say. Is that right? No, no, that's right. That was a preloaded command. All right. Good job. You guys all fit in there. You guys comfy? I was going to see my lady. She's your mate and a phone man. We're packing your face. Whoa, whoa, whoa, sauce. What was this? Come on out, man. You're dead. What happened, bro? I got pushed in there. I pushed out, man. That is tragic. What does that mean? My sauce, please go inside the Sherman weight. Why are you trying to make me the next victim? Hold on. We're right with you, man. We're so sorry. This whifter says go into prone. Is all good? Oh, I just hit. All right. I'm going to keep on using the same stuff over and over again. If you're not standing by the time the smoke clears, you die. I think I said gun tarhead. I have to see, man. You guys are too smart for this now. Oh, you think they're going to do a firing line? I wasn't thinking about that, but you know let's do it. It's a good idea. You said someone would come out, shoulder on this yellow line over here? No. You can hide wherever you want in this room. Dude, look, it's a good idea. No, not that yellow. That's not fair at all. This is backup. Oh, come on. Come on. Come on. That's what I'm talking about, I'm not sure. Come on. All right. Listen, here's the rules. So you can hide anywhere you want in this room, man. Next change they can use whatever weapon they want. Anything. Did I make your head? No, just shut up! All right. You just have to look away the whole way. What kind of woman is Cyrus? No. Hello. spot. Yeah man look yeah exactly there it is. Yes now now you're thinking with with portals I don't know that's not in the lines. Tortuses go. I thought grenades were allowed. We're weapon. That's what he said. He said it is a weapon. He's a weapon. He's a weapon. That's what he did. Yeah. I think it bounced back. I think it bounced back. It's just one through the end of the line. Only one person died. Okay everyone follow me. Swifter says follow me. He threw the grenade. I see. Not chillantly. All right let's see here. So what does this mean? Test of not real. Like I believe I can hang off this thing. Yeah good good good good. Tortuses go back down there please. Keep it fair. All right and our very first switch or says in Montware Fair 2 we did a lot of like pull up many games hanging off many games. This space is so huge it will fit all of you guys. So last person to hang off dies go. That one's falling to this stuff anymore. Ride oh you were just trying to get up here man you weren't trying to do the challenge right. No exactly. Yeah we're good. That's the right answer. Hang on I'm gonna go up there so I can view. As long as I can find that's a log route over your jeez. Yeah Swiftresses be it hang off that fence. And just so we can hurry this up Swiftress says you have a 30 seconds. Everyone must be hanging off. No. But I expect you guys move man. 20 seconds left. 20 seconds left.

What the hell I ain't do that. All right. Swiftress says I want you guys to go as far south as you can on this fence without falling off. There we go. Great. Alright. Swiftress says going forward if you fall off you automatically die. They don't fall off. They hear the rules. Swiftress says if you have a pistol and you're hanging off the fence. Swiftress says you're a lot of a face west. Direct west. There should be a big W at the very top middle of your screen. If it's not there you're doing it wrong. Alright. Great. You're only allowed to fire your gun west directly west. Alright. You guys your challenge me to run along this fence on top. And get through this door. That's it. I am so dead. We are all dead.
