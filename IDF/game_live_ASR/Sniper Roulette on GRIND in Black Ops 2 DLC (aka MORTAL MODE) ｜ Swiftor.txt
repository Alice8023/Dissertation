Everyone's in a nice, neat little circle with their sensitive reset to max and target assist disabled. We'll be sping around one at a time and a circle firing a shot. If it kills someone, excellent if it doesn't. You just want to hope that you don't get shot later on. Last two players face off in a special duel. Let's see where we'll begin in the circle. It'll be... Alright, let's go with random. Random, you'll kick it off. Spend around a circle, fire a shot. We'll go counterclockwise from here. Go for it, man. Alright, next. There you go. Oh.

Oh, and that is it. All right. All right. So it's going to be staying versus Brad. All right, guys. Let me explain how the duel happens. You guys will shake hands, turn around, so you're back to back. When I say fire, you'll turn around. You'll aim in your fire one shot. You can't move out of the way. You can't jump. You can't go into prone. There's no dodging. It's all about turning around and aiming as quickly as you can to take that shot. This is not where you'll be participating. Let's go give you guys a little bit more room to kind of walk. But you guys take a stroll together through the park. Find a nice lit straight away. Good sunshine. Nah. Nah. Here's good. Perfect.

So once again, you both understand it's one shot. Great. Shake hands. Turn around, so you're back to back. Now, everyone else remains silent. We don't need any confusion happening. Walk as slowly as the game will let you gentlemen. And wait for my word. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Oh, very close. You ready to go, Brad?
