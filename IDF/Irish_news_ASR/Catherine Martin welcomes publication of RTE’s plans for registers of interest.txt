 Minister, we've seen the publication of the register of interests at this morning from RTE. Can I get your reaction to what's been published so far, but that work has begun. And then also, we could just talk a little bit again in relation to RTE, but the data has gotten begun, the negotiations have been specifically figured in mind in terms of the more media-bounding problem. In relation to the register, it's something that the DG indicated to last week, but that was going to be published this week. And I welcome it. I think it's another element of that transparency and reform that we need to see. And I think what's really important here is that consultation with staff and unions, and I'm really interested to see how they react to it too. So I'm delighted that he is doing that consultation, but it's what's needed. Absolutely. So another step on that road to reform. In relation to the bailout, as I've said, I'm waiting figures from New Year that I expect to get. And in the coming weeks that will inform those negotiations for the interim funding, then we'll negotiate with Minister.
