 I think whether you're a player or anybody involved honor off the field or reason as far as spectators go really You know the value of respect in rugby is is hugely important That is something that we sort of pride ourselves on particularly here in in the URC on those values And when that line is crossed and it becomes unacceptable then sanctions or the issues need to be to be dealt with So I didn't see the williams as an incident I obviously I was working on the game on Saturday and I hear the comments between New Jenkins and I'm not here now I thought my funeral dealt with it very very well on the field and that was dealt with Neil there needs to be reminded that you know if you are being on the field When I was referring I if a water carrier came on or coach came on if you had something to say to me I didn't have much issues it was all to do with How it was said and what a context of what he was saying I don't think you should be coming on and telling the referee they're doing this they're doing that You're not that that's what you're on there for but if you'd come on and say something in the right context Then I wouldn't have too many issues with that But when it becomes then you're coming on and you're having a go at the referee then that that does not is not acceptable And that those that needs to be deal with dealt with That is a quiet word that it may be an official warning or letter or there could be a sanction It all depends on what you feel It is appropriate to deal with whatever was was said so there is something I think we need to make sure that we stay on on top of and and deal with this because I know here in the US You we will deal with these issues if they arise and it's important we do that because we have to keep the value of Ethos and respect in in in the game You know we saw it Happening in one of the pro in what you are seeing games with Dan Baow and the referee It was dealt with and that's what I think you know particularly you are seeing we do in rugby is that when the issues do arise We deal with them and we must deal with them and we must keep that that value of all respect and you know It's not a case of me becoming on as a coach and you can't open your mouth and speak to the referee I wouldn't want to be in a situation where we arrive at that But what you say and how you say it I think is is the key thing and if that line is crossed Then yes, it needs to be needs to be to be to be dealt with and I said you know Whether anything will come from it on the weekend But I thought my funeral dealt with it there and then and I'm sure that you know the wiu On even gas himself with you know will have a word with with with with jinx and say like you know That's not we want an apology maybe a look here sorry heat in the moment Allergy and then and then we we move on and that's what I think is important
