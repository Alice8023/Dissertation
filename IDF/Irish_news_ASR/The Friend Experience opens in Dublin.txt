 I'm here at the Friends Experience at the Point in Dublin. We're about to head inside and have a look at some of the iconic set pieces and memorabilia from the show from the 90s and it's already pretty packed here on a Tuesday morning and it opened this week. So even though friends ended a little bit before I was maybe old enough to be watching the show, it is something that I have always returned to you and I've seen every episode of Probably Multiple Times at this point, which made coming to the Friends Experience really exciting. There was such a buzz when you first come in the door and get to see the iconic couch in front of the fountain and then walk through and see all of the different sets that you can kind of really immerse yourself in. So everything from Monica's apartment and the iconic door and people to the table where many a conversation argument from Antic Trist has been explored and discussed. You know, it looks legit. Hopefully, the naked guy is not present. I'm looking. Trying to find him, but... Then you can pop over and spoil the apartment. Take a seat on the couch. So I'm in the bottom. Should I like... I don't want to touch it. Oh wait. Maybe! Maybe! I'm just so excited. Or you can pop in Central Park and grab a coffee. And see where people from Faye would have done a wonderful rendition of Smelly Cat. Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat. What are they feeding you?
