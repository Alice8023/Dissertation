 Okay, welcome to this weekend's Sunday Independent Ireland thinks poll and it's a big one where a week out from the election and where the results that have come in are quite frankly they will take people aback so the biggest result so far in this poll is Sinn Fein dropping a massive 7 points down from 29 to 22 and then we also have Fina Gale up 3 to 22 now neck and neck which Sinn Fein Fina for all are up slightly from 16 to 17 the social Democrats are down one from 6 to 5 the green party are on change at 4 aint 2 are on change at 4 a tree the labor party are on change at 3 so solidarity people for profit are on change at 2% another big result the independence and other categories has jumped from 19 to 23% and now that group of voters is the biggest and most popular amongst people a mirror 6 days out from the election or 5 at this point and I'm joined here by Kevin Cunningham from Arna Tinks and Jorri Corquan from the Sunday Independent and first to you Kevin what do you make of that drop in support for Sinn Fein? yeah it's staggering it's it's quite unbelievable in some respects if remember last month in April Sinn Fein went up to 29 they actually had a bit of a bounce because when we polled it was polling very much in the context of when the immigration issue had occurred and Sinn Fein had taken a very strong anti-immigration position particularly in relation to that EU asylum pact but now today we're seeing them dip further than they had dip deep previously right back down to 22% and I think one of the main reasons for this is a sort of a campaign effect the last time we polled was outside of campaign I think what happens in campaigns is the people sharpen their minds they start to understand what are the options I'm not sure if Sinn Fein can sort of out immigrant the independent candidates who are already standing on this sort of position and just on that Jorri the biggest group now amongst the electorate who they want to support just as they go to the polls is independence what do you put that down to him where do you see that moving the country? yeah it is unprecedented direct 23% their largest political grouping in the country the cabinet is talking about the campaign effect we need to bear in mind that this is the first election far Sinn Fein since the general election it's big breakthrough election so this is the first real challenge for Sinn Fein as to how solid that support was in the general election it's certainly immigration has been the catalyst behind the impetus behind independence but I'm tending to think there's more going on here than the immigration issue and I think for the last few elections in fact you could go back to the crash there has been a floating vote which went to Finnegaille which went to Sinn Fein and I think it's floating again in the first election since and it's floating to independence certainly immigration is part of it but it's not the only part or other issues going on here we've also seen in the poll Kevin that Mary Lume McDonald's personal support is taking a bit of a nose dive are people just don't see Mary Lume McDonald and Sinn Fein as the change that they have been talking about for so long anymore? yeah I mean you'll hear a lot of people saying that she's not as quite as visible as other politicians in recent months you're absolutely right the numbers from Mary Lume McDonald's is now 36% on our figures that stay from 40% and a contrast very sharply with that of Simon Harris who's now jointly the most popular leader with with me Holmarton up from 43 to 48 you can contrast their styles you can contrast the way in which they've taken their leadership in recent months in relation to and have they've they've responded to the rising sayings of immigration as Jody was talking about as well and I think perhaps Simon Harris has been a bit more proactive a bit more able to kind of win support on that then Sinn Fein has as we've seen recently and Jody finally what does this poll tell us about what the make up of the next government may be? okay interesting question we regularly ask questions about enforced choice what do you think the election would be and the next government would be and in this poll pure blue water isn't they were merging by far the favorite choice for next government is phenophonic ale and the independence as opposed to the alternative option of a thin of Sinn Fein led government excluding phenophonic ale it's well into double figures now and it is looking like that movement behind the independence is kind of conjealing with a phenophonic ale government which might be unlike the 26th in government with where it was the phenophonic ale and independence underpinned of the citrida confidence yes yes yes yes yes true okay that's all for now but you can read far more about our opinion poll in tomorrow's Sunday independent and on independent.i and the coverage also includes some fascinating results of each of the European constituencies which people will be voting for next Friday you
