 I'd like to thank everybody for coming to the press conference today, which is to launch or announce a March for the 10th anniversary of the death of Savita Oliver. Savita's anniversary is on the 28th. The March is going to take place on the 29th on the Saturday in Dublin City Centre. Savita's death marked a turning point in Irish socially change. The personal tragedy for Savita's family turned into public outrage. And I think that outrage led and ignited a huge movement in this country for repeal and for abortion rights. I think that the March is very important because we appeal to people to remember Savita and say never again should any woman die or suffer who's asked for an abortion. Never again should people have to travel either for health care as they currently do. And never again should religious views be allowed to take precedence over human rights in this country, in health, in education and world affairs of life. We also will be marching in solidarity with women, LGBT people and all those who are fighting for their rights and for abortion rights in the US, in Iran and all around the world on that day.
