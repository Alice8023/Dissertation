 There are no words to describe the pain in our hearts right now Tina. If we knew the last time we met was going to be our last time. We would have hugged you extra tight. Tina would put a smile on anyone's face. She had a very bubbly personality and was a sociable person. She was always out and above with her babies Ruby and Heidi. She loved her fashion. She was always dressed so well. We will cherish the moments and all the great memories we spend with you. Fly high or angel, you will be in our hearts forever. We love you Tina. You are a peace now until we meet again, given any big hug from you.
