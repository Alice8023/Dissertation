 We're here in the, just outside of the Valley of William and State. It's a dearly exciting, it has been this way for many years. It was first approved in 2005. Building work commenced sometime shortly afterwards. And it is currently in the ownership of the Limersitting County Council for the last two years. And as you can see, it's in a huge state, a serious state of their election. As most of you would be aware, there is an acute shortage of social housing in this town, with a list quite long. And this is the state being lived here in this condition. It's shameful. And as a member of the Limersitting County Council, you would have to be ashamed. One would have to be ashamed because the Tower Authority are leaving this state in such a manner. It's the fact that there are monies there for the construction of houses and completion of the states. And I think the Limersitting County Council housing section need to get the right together and get this work here completed one way or the other. The side irrespective of whether to decide to demolish the whole site as it stands and rebuild. But they've got to make it a decision sooner or later.
