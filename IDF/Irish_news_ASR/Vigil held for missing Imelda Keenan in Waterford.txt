 We never talked about my sister who had missing 13 years ago. Please come forward with that little bit of information. We needed, we needed now. We're not looking for revenge. We never, the king of family never spoke about revenge for the 30 years that I have come to repent. All you is who you wanted was to bring our sister home. Home to rest with my parents. Home to rest with my brother that's in Valley Bake, in the graveyard in Valley Bake.
