 I didn't pay too much heat to what was happening in London. I saw the salary released here. I saw the news like everyone else, so I paid all the things and that's what it is. It's happened before, so this isn't new. It's not a news story for me in the sense that the story has been reported on a year ago or two years ago and before that again. So it's part and parcel of what we do. What about the gender pay gap? Review and how do you feel about that? I think it's really healthy. Yeah, I think it's a healthy development. I have, I am a father of two daughters. I have two sisters, a mother who I love and the idea of inequality of any sort. Pay respect any of it. To me as a parent, fix it and review is a good start. But after the review has to come to the action. So I'm hoping that happens. Thank you.
