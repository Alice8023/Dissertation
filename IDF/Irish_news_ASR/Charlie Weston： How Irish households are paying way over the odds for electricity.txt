 Arish households are paying way over the odds for their electricity. Electricity prices in this country are about 80% higher than the average across the European Union. This amounts to about 900 euros extra being paid here by households compared to the rest of the European Union. This is based on information from a survey conducted regularly. It's called the household energy price index and it looks at costs of electricity and gas in 32 European countries. It's conducted by the Austrian regulator and the Hungarian energy regulator. Ireland comes out as the most expensive country in the European Union for electricity. And when it comes to gas, we're pretty expensive as well. We're about 50% more expensive for domestic gas than the average for the 27 countries. Electric prices have doubled in this country in the last 18 months due to the invasion of Ukraine. And the prospects of a cut, well, unfortunately, despite all the say prices dropping like a stone in the last few months, the energy regulator reckons with only, you see, a small cut in prices. We could see 10 to 20% reduction in the costs of electricity in the next few weeks. And that really isn't any great conservation for people because we're paying way over the odds. I asked the energy regulator the commission for the regulation of utilities. Why were paying so much for energy in this country? And it blames the fact that we have to import so much fossil fuel, particularly gas, which is the biggest import for generating electricity in this country. And also, the regulator blames the fact that we're not in the periphery of Europe. But it does seem as if we need a radical overhaul of how energy is provided in this country when it emerges that way where it was so expensive. People would be forgiven for thinking that they're getting ripped off royally. And when it comes to the cost of electricity and gas in this country.
