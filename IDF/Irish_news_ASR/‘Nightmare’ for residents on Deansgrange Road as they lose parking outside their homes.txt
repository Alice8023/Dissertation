 It has been a week now since residents and businesses on Dean's Grange Road have lost their parking. The decision was made by Don Leroy and Wrathdown County Council, which will now see the transformation of this road into a two-way street with the cyclist lane. From now on, residents will no longer be able to park outside their homes. One of those who've seen the effects of this decision is a resident Maeve Hickey. Maeve has resorted to knocking down her front wall to fish her car outside her home. At the moment, access is very bad. From my husband, Maeve Hickey had a stroke and his mobility is very bad. As you can see, my self-taughting to get in and out. Maeve Hickey is a big man. He can't get in and out there now. So he's not even able to use the car now, even if he wanted to. The first truck to home now, yeah, it's fine, it's very hard. And it isn't just residents feeling the effects. De-curry, owner of Flareys by D, has noticed the significant dip in sales since these world-works have commenced. We had a great little business on the level of 15 weeks ago when they turned the road one way. It was like a collapse. It just went down. And now it's gone to the stage. We're here. We're not really here because we have no traffic of people. The only business I really have now is online business, the website. But otherwise, like, from about 20 to 40 people, you come in here every day, a few Flareys are going to dinner, to go wherever, to now, two to three people a day. So it's gone down about 80%. So you're watching your business die, you're watching your Flareys die. You're getting calls from like your clients at your heart to say, D, we can't get around to you. We can't drive down that street. And I do say to them, look, I don't blame you if you have to go somewhere else, where you can park, where you can literally walk in. At the moment, and I'll try to take my load and pay away, which is for all the business on the street. If that goes, I'm gone.
