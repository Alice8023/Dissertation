 Paula, why did you want to tell your story? Because I want to tell every woman or man out there that it's okay. It's okay to come forward and that you're not alone and that you have a voice. And you've been so courageous up to now and so brave that you just use your voice and just tell one person that you're not alone. And can you tell me how your life changed after the night of the attack? I feel Paula, the old Paula, Paula died that nice. I feel like I'm now Michelle of the person that I used to be. Bus, now that the trial is over, I'm going to try and work on myself and get myself back. Can you tell me, can you describe the campaign of terror that you were under prior to the rip? I have received messages, videos, photographs, some vile, some very bad sexual messages from an anonymous person and that I didn't know who it was and they played me for over three and a half years before the actual rape.
