 It has previously been dubbed the most expensive treatment in the world, at a cost of around 3 million per patient, but now it's available to patients in Ireland. Lib Meldi, a once-off gene therapy treatment, has been approved by the Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly. It treats a very rare fatal degenerative condition known as MLD, which affects around 1 to 2 children a year in Ireland. The treatment allows children live a normal life. The condition is caused by a faulty gene and has devastating effects over time. The price was at the heart of the delay in approving the therapy, but access has been made possible through negotiation and Ireland's participation in a collaboration between Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Austria. Les Martin and his wife Linda have been campaigning to get the drug for Ireland for many years after tragically losing their son, Kahel, to the disease at the age of 6. The couple from Rathnew in Wicklow said Kahel went from being a healthy child to having trouble walking. They were unaware he had inherited the condition. Kahel was paralyzed for four years before he passed away in 2021. Because Kahel was diagnosed, it meant his younger brother Keeron was tested. He was also found to have the faulty gene, but there was time to give him limb veldi, which his family travelled to Italy to have administered. Apart from some very minor nerve damage, Keeron is now perfectly healthy. Les Martin said the campaign is not over, and the next step is to screen all newborns for MLD because the treatment needs to be given within the first year.
