 I've been a member of the E-Swall community. I'm not, I wasn't born there. You know, I was born in Cork, but I moved our two years going in such a welcoming community and it should be welcoming community for everybody that's there. And you know, the recent protests were very concerning and very upsetting to me and it really compelled me to just join this group to show solidarity with the resident, with the new residents of E-Swall and with people seeking asylum in the area. So that was really what spurred me on. You know, I was quite saddened and concerned by everything that was happening with the protests and that wasn't my view. And I know it's not the view of a lot of people in E-Swall either. So we just want to make people aware that, you know, the protests that are going on are not representative of everybody living in E-Swall. That a lot of people living there do really want to welcome people seeking asylum into the area and believe that they deserve, you know, a place to put their head at my ultimate place. So... I refresh who do not want wets to jones who have deliberately invited in both your phones to push up property prices and therefore every attempt, every attempt to blame a refugee or a silent figure, is really an attempt to cover and make excuses for the political needs. There's a genuine shortage of resources. We think it's government policy that produces the housing crisis. It's the behavior of landlords and developers. It's making housing for profit that causes the problem and the other shortages in Irish society are not refugees. The cows and classes was here long before refugees arrived. And secondly, we just think that a lot of this is tapping in to deep racist prejudices that somehow or other black men or single men that are criminals or rapists and are threat to our community. This is always said by the far right about migrants and refugees.
