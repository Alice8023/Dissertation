 We're about to get a new tax. It's going to be called a new vacant home tax and it's going to apply from November the 1st. This new tax is to try and encourage homes that are unoccupied, to encourage the owners to rent them out or to sell them. So it'll apply from November the 1st, it's going to be a self-assessed tax. You have to get on to revenue and fill out a form and you have to pay it by the 1st January. The rate of this tax, it's going to be three times the local property tax for each property. So suppose you have a property that would generate a property tax of about 315 euros a year, the vacant property tax then will be three times that 945 euros. So nearly a thousand euros. This new tax will apply to any homes that have been unoccupied for more than 30 days in the last year since October 21st. It's going to be applied to about 60,000 homes. It's not going to raise a lot, 3 million maybe, just only 3 million euros. So probably will cost more to administer that it will to actually, you know, in terms of what it'll raise. There are some exemptions if the home is owned by somebody who's ill or is in a hospital or a home, it won't apply. If the home is being renovated, the tax won't apply. And a lot of holiday homes are going to escape because there's quite a few exemptions. So the idea here anyway is just to get more houses on the market to be rented or to be sold because we have a housing crisis. So that's what it's about. So we're getting the new tax, get ready for another new tax on the way.
