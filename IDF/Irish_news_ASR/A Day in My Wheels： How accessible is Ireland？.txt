 So how long have you been on a wheelchair? So I've been a wheelchair user for 10 years now, had my accident in December 2012. What are some of the challenges you face as a wheelchair user in Ireland right now? So some of the main challenges that I find is accessibility and transport. So from an accessibility point of view, I live in Dublin City Centre, which is the capital of our country, but a lot of the buildings, especially in the inner city, aren't accessible. So that can be very difficult when in terms of going over friends or going shopping. A lot of the facilities aren't up to scratch, if you will. And an awful lot of the venues were claimed to be accessible. And it's just a ticking box of accessibility. And that can be difficult in terms of trying to live my life. I've gone over friends and just been a 24-year-old young man, I suppose. And then from a transport perspective, I think we have good transport in Dublin, but if you live early, it can be very difficult. I've spoken to other friends of mine, and other wheelchair users, and that can be a real problem in terms of them living their life. And even in Dublin, we have the dark service, you know, that runs the length of Dublin, but when it comes down to lifts, actually being operational, and having to give 24 hours notice to actually get it out, you know, that can be very difficult to plan your life 24 hours in advance. And then even when you do show, it's sort of Russian-related in terms of whether the lift will be working on it. And I think that the Department of Transport could do a lot more in terms of making it much easier for people with disabilities and wheelchair users to access transport equally. And tell me what you're hoping to achieve with this campaign, tell us a little bit about it. So a day in my wheels is a campaign run by Spawn Lynch, Ireland. It's being hosted on the 27th of September in Dublin and the fort of October in Cork City. And the campaign is really about raising awareness about what it's like to live your life as a wheelchair user. And by no way can we ever truly give the full perspective of what it's like to have a disability. But we found that when people sit in the chairs, they have a unique experience and it can be quite eye-opening to the major and to the minor teams that wheelchair users sort of have difficulties with in terms of accessibility. And, you know, getting around and just living their life on a day-to-day basis. And that's really what the campaign hopes to raise awareness with is to get those who haven't got first-hand experience with disability or with being a wheelchair user or having a Spawn card injury about sort of giving them that perspective and trying to sort of take an advocate also on our behalf in terms of accessibility and equality. So in these last ten years where you've been using a wheelchair, has anything changed for the better? So in the ten years that a wheelchair user, I would say that recently I actually about a year ago I started driving. And that has been totally dramatically changed my life in terms of my independence. I've just been able to live my life on a more basis if that makes sense. And just now having to rely on public transport and potentially broken lifts or having to give 24 hours now to get the direct. It's just really increased my level of independence and just in terms of me getting out and just living my life to whatever way I feel pleased and whatever time I want to as well. It's definitely a game changer for me personally.
