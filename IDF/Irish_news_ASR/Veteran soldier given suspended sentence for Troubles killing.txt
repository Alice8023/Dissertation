 We believe that the sentence today was extremely harsh considering the passage of time and, you know, the what David Holden has had to go through over the last number of years. When you compare this to the Good Friday Agreement and the deals that were struck about terrorists, that they would never serve more than two years if they were convicted for any legacy offense. Now, we have David Holden just been convicted for a manslaughter through gross negligence, so there's clearly a disparity between terrorists and the security forces that served in Northern Ireland. Totally unacceptable and something that we've been saying all along throughout the legacy process. It's a disgrace and should never have happened. And that's all I've got to say on the matter. Thank you very much.
