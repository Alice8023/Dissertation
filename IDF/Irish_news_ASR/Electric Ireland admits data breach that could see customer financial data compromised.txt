 The largest electricity and gas supplier in the state, Electric Garland, has admitted to a huge data blunder. As many as 8000 of its customers may have had their data compromised, this could lead to fraudulent activity on their accounts, if the information gets into the wrong hands. Electric Garland said an employee of a company working on its behalf may have inappropriately accessed 8000 residential customer accounts. It said it's reported this to the Guardi and to the Data Protection Commissioner. Electric Garland said their investigations have established that around 8000 customer accounts may have been compromised. It's written to these customers and told them to be aware of the issue and it's given them advice on what to do to make sure that their financial information is not compromised in any way. Electric Garden, as we know, is owned by ESB, which has stayed owned. It has 1.1 million customers. It said it was fully appreciative of the gravity of this issue and it's very sorry for the inconvenience that this caused. But it's just the latest blunder from the company which in the past wild has overcharged customers and had to refund them and has miscalculated bills. But this is quite a serious issue and could end up with people having their financial information compromised. They may have to take change details on their customer accounts. So anybody affected by this would have got a letter from Electric Garland. If you didn't get a letter from Electric Garland during the career, you should be okay. But it might just be worth checking your account anyway.
