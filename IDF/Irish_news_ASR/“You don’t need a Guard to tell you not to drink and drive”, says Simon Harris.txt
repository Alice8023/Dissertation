 Just on the testimony of the police in Newfoundland, we report on the last day that there won't be as opposed to most days between the hours of 2am and 7am, there won't be dedicated road policing officers on duty as part of this plan, this before-robot-drew house. Did he discuss that with you at all on Friday? Does that not concern you? You're talking about drove driving, drink driving. Like a lot of it happens between those hours, isn't it? So firstly, can I just bring a back to responsibility every single one of us as a citizen? You don't need a guard to tell you not to drink the drive. And we really have to start up in conversations in our families in the workplace around this sort of trend. That doesn't take away from the importance of the point you made. The commissioner and I have an administrator just discussed a really two issue. One of the facts that he was prioritising road safety using all of the guard resources that were available in terms of saying to every guard 30 minutes a day. 30 minutes doesn't sound like a lot. 30 minutes multiplied by the number of guards is a significant creative time. The second assurance that he did give me a minister was that this year a wincing road police officer was a risk of risk of losing a road police officer. That's something that I'm going to continue to work with often to get into the specific situation.
