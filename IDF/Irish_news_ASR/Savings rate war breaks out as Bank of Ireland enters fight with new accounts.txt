 The last thing we might have expected was a savings price war to break out. But that's exactly what's happening now at the moment, which is great news for those people who have some spare money to save in a bank. And there's about 153 billion euros in savings out there. What's happened is, last week, Revolute launched a new savings account in this market, which rates up between 2% for those who have a standard revenue account. Up to 3.49% if you pay for one of the expensive monthly current accounts. So Bank of Ireland has surprised everybody by coming out with new, high yielding rates. They're offering a two-year rate at 3%, and a one-year rate at 2.5%. Now these are good rates, but you know, you have to tie your money away. The Revolute rates are demand money. You don't have to tie your money down for a number of months. But there's a little bit of flexibility around Bank of Ireland's rates as well, because they allow you to take up to a quarter of what you've saved without suffering any penalty. So this is all good news, and it wasn't expected because next week, from next week on, European Central Bank is about to cut its rates. So the expectation was that deposit rates, savings rates would be reduced, but instead now we're seeing the opposite. So A, I, B would have to respond now as a big player in the market, and they'll have to offer a better savings rates. So good time to be a saver if you have any spare money.
