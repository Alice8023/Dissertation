 So in Weekend Magazine on Sashite we have Emma Donahue who's the Irish Oscar nominee and the writer of Room. She's talking to us about being on the red carpet at these big celebrity events. She's been at the Golden Globes and the Oscar nominees' luncheon and she's looking around at the like spread and jailow and saying you know what it's like for a real woman to be among that. So it's a really good read. You know Robby's the only game attend this weekend to Ireland taking on France. So we're talking to Robby Pondit, Alan Quinlan about you know his predictions for Ireland in the tournament but also his personal life working on Ireland's fitness family and his relationship with his son. And another strong personality in the magazine this weekend we have Dr Eva Orisman who's giving us her life lessons on everything from weight and sugar which is her expertise but to her own body image and telling us about her own personal story.
