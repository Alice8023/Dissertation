 We're here today at the launch of the Samaritan's National Talk to us campaign. We caught up with Ryan Dobson to talk about the importance of talking and also to hear all about his new career as a college professor. Well, I'm going to do some part-time occasional lecturing and workshops in the University of Limbrick. That's right, yeah, with the journalism students, which I'm very looking forward to. I have visited on a previous occasion and arising from that they asked me what I do in a more formal way. So I said sure, of course. So they call me a professor, which makes us send rather grand, but basically I go down and I do some workshops and work with some of the students. Do you want to write a guy in an immortal? No, I won't. But I told everyone in our tea expert them to stand up and I come into the room, which of course has been entirely ignored, but there you go. Serves me right. Well, I know that I'm in a family where we all try and talk and I certainly talk a lot to my wife and she talks a lot to me and we talk to our children and they talk to us and they talk to other people. And I think it's the first thing you need to do if you have issues in your life is to share them with people because if you keep them bottled up, they get bigger and bigger and bigger, don't they? And they become more and more overwhelming. So that's why I was very keen to support this. I believe it's now a month-long campaign that some of our students are running. I think it's actually a campaign. I know they want to make a particular point about men, and be men of my age, that it's traditionally men of maybe a friend of more difficult to talk about emotional issues or mental health issues or how they feel about things. And I think that's the message they want to get out that more and more men are speaking out. That's been the experience a lot of their volunteers as I understand just and that's something we want to continue and encourage. This is Kirsteu Becnaux for independent.ie
