 I do wish to propose an alternative to the indistrambler here today in the name of Deputy Michael Healyray, who was represented Kerry here in this chamber for many, many years and Kerry, on Kerry County Council for many years before that. I believe he is well capable of carrying out the task because he has the understanding of the people and like myself, he knows what the people need and what their concern about. Now is he trying to come out and what for an independent candidate for Tisha here today? This is a chance, but the most we have, that say your independence if any year that happened, there's no different signal for the people outside to look in here, for the fall and for any year, the same fear no longer will be up to go with either go and the greens, the greens will be written out for with the help of God. Go to my God, can't call her, touch it, I got her. I raise her.
