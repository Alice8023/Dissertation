 So in this Saturday's Irish in Japan and I'm going to be writing a piece about the final journey of Karen Buckley through the Glasgow countryside. We took a trip there through all the different scenes just before the trial in Glasgow of Alexander Pacto. So I'm going to be writing about that. I'm also going to be looking at his mindset. Two years ago he said that he would rather be tried with murder than rape and that was kind of prophetic. Goy, to bury all Ireland, turning 70 final. We have our flagship columnist Henry Schaefflin and Cyril Farrell at previewing the game and analysing both teams. To be again for rugby too, just before the rugby world cups kicks off, we've another warm-up game against Scotland and we have our new columnist as well, Alan Quintlin on that game. Well in Weekend Magazine this week we have our cover stars Nicky Bern who is doing a really fun photo shoot with us and talking about how he went from being kind of Simon Kells toy to a rising radio star at OOTD. Speaking of OOTD we have German fanon who's ever come to our show talking about why he hates conservatories and for fashion fans we have the autumn winter trends. One of the big stories of the week is the fact that the homeless crisis is back on the agenda. We were promised a Christmas after a man died on the streets outside Lentster House that this would end and here we are in August the middle of summer and we're learning that there's hundreds of people including young children still on the streets of them so we're sending Sam Griffin out to spend the night on the streets to see what the situation is really like. The other big story this week of course is the water protestors and Airbnb people seem to have really reacted to this story. There's a rio now between revenue and some tax experts who say actually the commissioners are wrong by saying that people have to pay tax on the income they get when using Airbnb. Saturday begins with the OOTD. Before you make up your mind
