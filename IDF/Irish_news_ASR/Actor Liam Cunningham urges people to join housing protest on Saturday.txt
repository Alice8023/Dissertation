 I'm going to read you out something from the UN Special Repertour on the right to housing. That's from 2019. Contrary to international human rights obligations, investment in housing in the Republic of Ireland has disconnected housing from its core social purpose of providing people with a place to live with security and dignity. The 26th of November at 1 o'clock pernell square there is a protest for the right to housing. There is a housing disaster going on. There are people heading to the airports. If you do not want to see your children of a Dublin airport, a car airport, a shenan, then you need to come out. This is for the sake of your children and the homeless and everybody else that's struggling to put a roof over their head. Come and join me at 1 o'clock pernell square in Dublin on the 26th of November.
