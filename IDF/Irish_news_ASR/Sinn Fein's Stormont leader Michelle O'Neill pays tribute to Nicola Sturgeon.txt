 of Nicklis Georgian's resignation, the announcement of a resignation, that's something that I very much regret. I think as a colleague, as a friend, we've had a very close work from relationship over many, many years. We've many shared interests and there's no doubt in my mind that she will always be regarded as one of the most formidable leaders of our generation. She leaves a legacy of compassion, I think, in Scotland, a legacy of strength, a legacy of starting off the Tories, and a legacy of advanced and independent in Scotland. And I think that she certainly can be very proud of the legacy that she leaves behind, not least the fact that she has out-served five British Prime Ministers, not least the fact that she has been the first female Scottish First Minister, she is the longest serving Scottish First Minister. So I think for anybody in public life to leave this stage when you have achieved all of that is something to be rightly proud of and something that I certainly look onto and be really proud of what she's achieved.
