 I'm a photographic artist and I use analog materials to explore our relationship with the natural world and I'm particularly interested in exploring the space between fact and fiction or utopia and dystopia. I think it was just in the middle of the pandemic and I was craving an adventure and this seemed like the perfect opportunity and I spend a lot of my life working with very remote communities and it felt like a natural thing to do to apply to go to space and explore the most remote community ever which would be us in space. When I was selected as a crew member I got this email saying would you like to do one more interview and it was just MZ on the screen and I'm not really a cryy sort of person but I think I actually cried with excitement and just feeling overwhelmed but I hope that people see themselves in me and that you know it encourages people that they can do these things too.
