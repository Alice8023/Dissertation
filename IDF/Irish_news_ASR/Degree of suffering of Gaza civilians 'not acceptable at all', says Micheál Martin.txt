 In respect of the Middle East Ireland has called for humanitarian ceasefire to allow goods, aid and supplies to the hospital. This is a matter of the utmost urgency. The last of life is enormous. Is that a scale that has to be stopped? An order of view, the suffering of innocent civilians, particularly children, is on a scale that requires an immediate cessation in our view. And the provision on an accelerated and comprehensive scale of water, food and medical supplies. We all have to work collectively, the European Union, with regional partners in the neighbourhood, to use all of our influence, to keep pressing for humanitarian pause in Gaza, and work to prevent that escalation. We understand Israel's need to deal with Hamas because it was an appalling attack. But the degree of suffering now that innocent civilians in Gaza is suffering is not accepted at all. In our view, that's why we believe a humanitarian pause is required to put a minimum and get aid and supplies in there. We have to distinguish between the civilians of Gaza and Hamas. And that is why we believe that the pause is no required. There are too many innocent civilians being killed and who are suffering to an extraordinary degree. Thank you very much today.
