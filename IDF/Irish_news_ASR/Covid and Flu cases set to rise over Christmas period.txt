 Ireland is in a winter-illus way, cases of flu and COVID have risen, and they will increase further over Christmas and the New Year due to more people mixing and travel. Another virus RSV, which mainly affects very young children, remains at significant levels although cases are falling. The health protection surveillance centre provides a snapshot of which counties had the highest rates last week. It is based on limited data, but here are the figures. For COVID, waterfurt had the highest rate per 100,000 last week. It was followed by Sligo, Dunigold, Kilkenny, Kavan, Ophley and Wixford. When it comes to flu, the highest rates were in Dunigold, which appeared to be particularly badly here. It was followed by Waterfurt, Cork, Golway, Sligo, Mayo, Lytrim and Carey. The HSC advises people to get vaccinated, to reduce illness and also reduce the numbers of patients sick from the virus's crowding hospital emergency departments and also be diligent when it comes to washing hands and protecting others from coughs and sneezes.
