 This Portuguese laral and acer lampest hedge in South County Dublin is arguably the most litigious piece of vegetation in Ireland at this stage. It's already gone through the sarcocort and in recent weeks it was in the high court because the owner of this house behind me is seeking to build another house in his back garden, cutting through the hedge and the grass verge. His neighbors, the residents along this road, went to the high court to overturn a board for an audit decision granted him planning permission, which did succeed and is now going back to the board. Now, this is South County Dublin and there does tend to be a lot of litigation and objections to planning permission. What's unique about this one is that the local county council's view is that people should be able to build houses, on-site and back gardens. But yet, this one is hit a major stumbling block. Amongst the residents of this road are a series of professionals. There's a barrister, an academic, a teologian and a former Irish international rugby player.
