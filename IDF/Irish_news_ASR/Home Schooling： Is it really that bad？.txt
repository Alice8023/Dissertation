 Don't miss this Saturday's Irish Independent where I explore homeschooling and I ask some difficult questions such as is homeschooling worth it? Are our parents needlessly sacrificing years of their life and a bit to give their children a great education? This week in review we look at the homelessness crisis in Ireland. They're now shocking 6,000 people homeless here can happen to ordinary families on any ordinary street. So this week our focus is all about the US. The exchange rate is really hard at the moment but it's not stopping us traveling and anything we're going even more this summer from Dublin there'll be 290 flights a week between Ireland and the USA. So 16 pages all about America this Saturday. So this Saturday's weekend magazine is a men's issue so we have PJ Galaher and Jason Burn on the cover. They're talking about being best buddies and we also have other famous Irish men talking about their best friends, their pals. James Martin's given us some tips as well on how to get the most out of your barbeque coming into the summer months. To complement this we have recipes from Byron Burgers to make some outrageous looking burgers. In fashion this week we also look at men's summer style we look at issues such as tire no tie or socks or no socks. A big weekend in sport is both the Aliens hauling leaks in the finals, huge attractions in G.A. Claire against Cakennie and Limerick against Waterford. I'll be dealing with Limerick where they've come from, where they're at and rugby is kind of the monster. I'll and Quindland dealing with that. And Vincent Hogan's column will be on the MMA tragedy. I'll the only person who seems to be forgotten all of this, Joel Clavario. Saturday's Irish Independent. It's your weekend.
