 Had we known that he was involved in any form of criminality, and I have to say I was profoundly shocked as were many many others to discover his criminal activism. He wouldn't have been anywhere near me or anybody else. And the courts now are dealing with this matter. Anybody involved in criminality, Gangland or with their face to full rigor, the full rigth to throw the book at them is what I say. I represent a constituency as you know that has borne the brunt of criminality and Gangland violence and thugory, and there can be no trouble with this, no room for it. And certainly I am relieved, pleased to see the justice now, the wheels of justice in motion. We leave it to the courts to deal with all of us.
