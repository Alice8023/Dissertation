 Learchick, can you tell us how special this morning is? Well, Connor, we're really excited because it's our first time to be inside since 2019. You saw yourself with hundreds of people gathering outside. Our luxury winners have arrived. We'll come inside at about 10 minutes, 2-9, and we'd wait and hope. And I would be hopeful, I would be optimistic. There's a slight band of cloud in the sky, but there's also a really glorious pinky glow. And how many do we have coming in here this morning to see this back to come? We'd be 17 and total in here this morning. We're in here again. 17 people, we had a perfect, perfect solstice. We gathered, we waited, and just a two minutes to nine. We got a first indication of light on the floor. And then the beam of light, lengthened and widened and at 9.15, the chamber was just a glow. It was a perfect morning.
