 I did look into this issue over the last number of weeks and when I answered the questions in relation to this matter at the end of November I was incorrect in my understanding regarding these civil commercial vows and I wasn't aware that any payment had been made to these individuals because we are really told that you weren't there was no payment made. This my understanding was because we put that understanding. This is the assessment that I've got wrong with regard to this because Finnegale Dupin Senf did not pay these individuals I assume therefore there was no expense on possible relation to this. I was wrong in that understanding. I have been wrong. I assume that because we did not pay them there was no cost that had been to this. I became aware of this during December I asked him in relation to it and I regret it for a while. I have done this. I was a bit of a huge progress. A huge progress was over the last number of months. I didn't give this the proper consideration and I was clear on some of the facts in regard to that campaign seven years ago. The fact that this campaign took place many years ago is not an excuse for what has happened. When the questions came in and when I became aware of an issue with Sybil I bought a lot of time into trying to understand what has happened and putting in the submission and it is a deep source of regret to me that I've involved in anything that might affect the perception of the public standing and integrity of myself, my party and the government and for that I apologize.
