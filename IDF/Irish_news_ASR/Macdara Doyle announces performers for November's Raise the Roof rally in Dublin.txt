 Official policy has now conspired to lock an entire generation out of the housing market and deny countless thousands the chance of secure independent living. So in our view, while we had a change of government in 2020, we did not have a change of housing policy and were continuing to repeat the same fail makes of mistakes of the past. So that's the context and the background to the rally that's taking place on November 26th and it's not a one-off event, it's part of a wider campaign and a longer running campaign because this is not going to change overnight. Instead of hosting I suppose it just in terms of the event itself, what might be about a more kind of traditional march in rally, we are going to we want to include a strong kind of musing or component component on the day and there will be a number of artists performing at the rally and on the day. So the artist confirm so far include Glenn Hansert, Lisa Lerichorck, Brent On Bagley and Donald Lunning and we expect to be announcing more names in the coin days around that and in terms of who's going to be performing on the day. So all 35 units are facing eviction and the people in my block I mean I'm a community worker, I work at the Irish National Organization with the Unemployed, I man a phone line listening to people's welfare concerns every day, I do vital work in my community there's a woman that works in james as hospital girl pret in indian woman who lives downstairs, alone parent with a four year old child and she's messaging me now saying I'm me and my child going to end up homeless, there's a maldove and construction worker who's a broken back who lives in one of the apartments on the ground floor, he messaged me the other day going I'm struggling to get to work, I'm in pain all the time but if I stop working I'm going to end up homeless. So these are the people that are being evicted from tathany house, we are the people that work in this city, we are the people that work in our community and yet we can't find anywhere to live, I'm looking on daft, I'm looking on these websites, I saw a single room in kimich for 1,800, I'm in my 40s now, you know I don't want to move into one single room all my stuff that I've gathered over the last 40 years of my life into one room, psychologically the idea that is terrifying, it's terrifying that I might have to go and live somewhere like that, you know because the choice might be emergency accommodation and there's no emergency accommodation, people are being sent to guard stations, so this is the reality of the housing crisis, so I mean we're fighting our landlord at the residential tenancies board, we're going to contest the fact that landlords who make 700,000 a year rent roll can just claim hardship and get out of the Terrell's town amendment and then evict 25 families into the rental market chaos and madness that we're all certainly going to face in the in the new year and which is causing a corrosive stress on everybody in my block, you know people like messaging me all the time on WhatsApp and just trying to keep everybody positive and focused on the path and protesting is a difficult job, it's a full time job in itself, but also we're calling on Dublin City Council and the government to step in and clarify the situation, the government has said that the tenant in situ directive only applies to hapt and razz tenants and people on the social housing list, but the social housing threshold is so low that most of the low paid workers in my block aren't on the social housing list, but they're too poor to pay Dublin rents, so what's going to happen to those people? Should they just get evicted? So we're arguing that cost rental funding that there could be other models whereby they can keep people in their homes and that Dublin City Council, if they don't want it by the block directly that they could facilitate the I.V. Trust who we've already spoken to and said they've already said that they're positively disposed to take in the building, so all we need is a green light from the government and from Dublin City Council and they should keep people in their homes. The final thing I wanted to say is that in all there's lots of people out there in my situation, there's a block of 20 flats in rap mines who are facing massive evictions, they've got their novice in August, there's their Shannon side arms in Limerick, you know where people are being evicted, so there's lots of people facing groups of people facing massive evictions, but there's lots of individual evictions and the eviction ban by the government is just a pause, they just put the pause button on because landlords can still give notice of eviction right up until the pause button is taken off and so what we're going to see is with talk of a global recession, we're going to see lots of landlords cash in out next year because they think the property market is about the turn, there's going to be lots and lots and lots of mass evictions and there's going to be lots of individual evictions, so I'm appealing to everybody who's facing eviction or even if you just feel insecure in your tendency, you just feel that you might be evicted to come out on the 26th, the Tani House residents, they're at mines residents and group spacing mass eviction, we will be there to support this rally on the 26th and I would appeal to everybody else who's in my situation to do the same thing, if we all stand together, the travelers, workers, unions, people, you know, focus Ireland, homeless people, if we all stand together we can win the change we need.
