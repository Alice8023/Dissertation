 Can you go off to cycling in? Excuse me, I take it off to cycling in. You're on your own cycling in? Here you go. Are you going to watch your treading? I tapped you to take it off to cycling in. It's about to take my turn. I left the bus come up this way. I don't care. You're not the bus in the cycle. You're going to watch your treading? Yes, treading. You're treading. I've got to the garage with that. Get my number. Why do we have to the garage with it? I asked you to get off to cycling. I'm going to the bike. I'm going to the bike. I'm going to the bike. The call may break.
