 There's good news from motorists. Petrol and diesel prices have fallen for the third month in a row, and the hope is that they will keep falling into the new year. The price of a liter of diesel is down nine cents this month when you compare it with last month, and petrol prices have dropped by eight cents a liter. This means the petrol is now down to one euro seventy two a liter, with diesel down to one seventy two as well, according to the latest AA Ireland fuel price survey. So this is good news. In September the price of diesel was one eighty five a liter. So we're now seeing prices come right back, and it's because crude oil prices have collapsed in recent months, leading to lower prices for drivers. We had feared that when the renewed hostilities broke out in Palestine and Israel, that crude prices would go through the roof. There were some expectations that crude prices would go up to a hundred dollars a barrel, but that just hasn't happened. What we're seeing at the moment is that Brent crude is down to about seventy five dollars a barrel. We also have a relatively mild winter as well, which means not ten. You know, there isn't a huge demand for petrol and diesel, and we have some extra supplies coming into the market despite the best efforts of the Saudis to restrict supply so that they can keep crude prices high. So this is all good news for drivers because it's so important in this country diesel and petrol because so many of us are dependent on cars because public transport isn't great, it's patchy in places. So the hope now is that in the in the new year, we'll continue to see diesel and petrol prices coming down. Of course, there's still a need for us to shop around. Often there's huge variations in the price you'll get from one garage to the next. So people will be wise to make sure they can get prices which are lower than 172 a liter. A lot of places are already selling below 172. So good news at least, anyway, on the petrol and diesel front.
