 When we talk about air pollution, we usually think of the air outside, but sometimes air quality inside our homes can be worse than outdoors. Data from 83 countries and cities, including Ireland, has found that indoor air carries a lot of particulate matter that's tiny pieces of ash, soot and dust. It also has a lot of chemicals released by gas, cooking and heating systems, paints detergents and even toiletries, they're called volatile organic compounds. Breathing these pollutants can cause short-term irritation and discomfort, but also long-term serious illnesses. Irish homes in general were found to have particulate matter levels twice the recommended level, and in Dublin it was higher again. In December and March, levels were notably higher indoors than outdoors. Dublin homes had especially high levels of volatile organic compounds. The analysis was carried out by electronics from Dyson, and 2.5 million air purifiers sold to customers around the world, the transmitted readings back to the company. Almost 4,000 of the units were in Ireland.
