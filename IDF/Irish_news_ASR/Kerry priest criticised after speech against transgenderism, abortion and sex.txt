 You rarely hear about sin, but it's rampant. It's rampant. And we see it, for example, in the legislation of our governments. We see it in the promotion of abortion. We see it, for example, in the example of this lunatic approach of transgenderism. We see it, for example, in the promotion of sex between two men or two women. That is sinful. That is mortal sin. And people don't seem to realize it. But it's a fact. It's a reality. I was talking to a woman there a few weeks ago. Her 17-year-old daughter, who was out with her friends and Trillee, came home. And she handed her mother a condom. The mother said, where did you get that? She said, an HSC van was handing these things out in Trillee. And she said, my grace is me. That is promoting promiscuity. That is horrible. Horrible.
