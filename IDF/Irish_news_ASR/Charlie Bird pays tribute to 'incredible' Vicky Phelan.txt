 I am so happy to be here this morning for the publication of this report which in very stark terms shows us the important work Samaritans do for the many people who find themselves in dark places. What amazingly is that almost all Samaritans all around the country are volunteers who are lending that all important ear without making judgments. Again what is incredible Samaritans provide what I call that listening ear service 365 days a year, 24 a day. In this very difficult period many many people find themselves in dark places and is vital that Samaritans are there to listen with their passing judgment. I have promised myself as long as I am alive I want to extend the hand of friendship and some guiding spirit directed me in the direction of Samaritans. You are an incredible group of people of light-patterned who I helped earlier this year along with the Irish Motor and Neural and Disease Association. You are all providing a crucial service to people who are in dark places. And so I really want to raise awareness for the important service Samaritans play for everyone. The honest truth is none of us knows when we might find ourselves in a dark place. After I got my diagnosis of a terminal illness around this time last year it was in a dark place. Obviously family and friends provided for me that listening ear but in a way the Samaritans I turned to was Vicky Fielin and who I kept in contact with over the past 12 months. She was an incredible human being and the espigy in a way was that Samaritans for me I want to end by just saying sometimes in this life we all need a shoulder to cry or that friendly listening ear provided all around the country. Heat strong and keep extending the hand of friendship.
