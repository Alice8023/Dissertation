 The iconic and its historic significance the rock of cash are possesses the most impressive cluster of many even villings in Ireland but now a more modern structure is attracting attention over 1000 years after Brian Brew was found high king of cashl the king of renovations Dernart-Bannon arrived with his room to improve tv show the Cinebrii architect transformed this house with stunning views of the UNESCO world heritage site but he opted to build first and ask forgiveness later as the house was built without planning permission and requiring an application for attention the program also showcased government grants for vacant and derelict homes which have co-underfire for failing to deliver as just 21 grants have been paid out in 18 months the room to improve portrayal of the grants being seamless is far removed from the reality experience by those who don't have the tv cameras in tow Stephen Denney a financial analyst originally from Kark who bought a rundown house in body firmerton Dublin would have viewed to renovating it with the aid of the government grants but nearly six months later he's still waiting for approval so we identified this house as a vacant property and we bought it because we could take advantage of the vacant property refurbishment grant and we couldn't afford a property that was a new build so the other option would have been a secondhand home like this and we were under the impression that the vacant property refurbishment grant application would take a maximum of six weeks and if I had known initially that the grant process was going to take a possible six months then I would have actually invested the 22,000 euro I've spent on accommodation already into the house and I would have not applied for the vacant property grant and at the moment I don't really know where the application stands so I really left a limbo so we don't know what we can actually do but the Department of Housing is delighted to have the King of renovations crowning their scheme
