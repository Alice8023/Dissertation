 But did you know what life was like in Palestine before October 7th? Did you know that Israel denied the exit of dozens of cancer patients from Gaza in 2023? Nearly 400 children in Gaza or at least two children a day were denied permits to go to the West Bank for critical health care in the first six months of 2023? I'm here today to speak the words of a wonderful poet called Dr. Rafi Atalorir. Who alongside his brother his sister and four of their children were slaughtered and a targeted attack on his sister's home. And I'm going to read these beautiful words that he wrote and had pinned to his Twitter profile since November 1st. And they're very human, they're very hard-breaking. I thought people should hear his words. I'm shameful as it is. I think it's intense and they conferred this today to go to Washington and take Patrick's Day to hand some rope to Joe Biden. How could anybody do that? The man that this government represents people, represents humanity and stand with a long suffering oppressed people of Gaza and Palestine to stop this massacre.
