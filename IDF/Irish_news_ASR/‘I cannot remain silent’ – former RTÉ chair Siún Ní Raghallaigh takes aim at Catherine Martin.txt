 Former Ortee board chair, Junior Ahli, has broken her silence and hit back at media minister Catherine Martin over what the ex-chair has branded her in force to dismissal by the minister in her RTE prime time interview. Missing her Ahli resigned dramatically after Minister Martin refused to express confidence at her during the interview. The minister said she had been misinformed about the ex-chair's role in approving an ex ad package for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. The development is the latest in the saga of controversies plaguing RTE. In a statement published via a public relations company, Missing Rahli said that Minister Martin had an active hands-off approach in communicating through her officials. The former chairwoman said it was baffling that the minister had asked questions about an exit package five months after it happened. In her statements she said, I cannot remain silent about the manner of my enforced dismissal which seemed designed to produce my reputation. She said at no point where she offered a phone call or meeting with the minister directly before prime time. She gave her own timeline of events leading up to the live interview, but Missing Rahli said she had no option to but to resign. After Minister Martin told the media she had sent a letter expressing disappointment in her.
