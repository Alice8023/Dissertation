 So, as we all know, we are in a very important time, a very important week where progress needs to be made on the issue of the protocol, on getting the executive back up and running, getting the assembly into action, and ensuring that people have government that we have leadership here in the north of Ireland. We had hoped to, with others, make progress on those issues at today's leaders meeting. I traveled for that meeting because I believe that it is an important meeting and bizarrely and in an unprecedented way, the British government chose to seek to exclude the leader, Sinn Fein, from a leader's meeting. The whole thing is absolutely bizarre and it has to be said unacceptable. We were at a time where we need maximum cooperation, we need politics that is civil, that is based on respect, and that recognizes the democratic mandate and the responsibility of every party including Sinn Fein. So, we meet tomorrow with Antishuk here in Belfast and with Kyrstarmid the leader of the British opposition. I think all of these meetings really matter. I think there is noness on all of us now to put our shoulder to the wheel and to make real progress because we are now what Ape Monsan from the election and people here have had to endure a stalemate that frankly is not acceptable.
