 I saw the labor. This protest is the culmination I suppose of 10, 14 years of activity to try and bring about the restoration of emergency department services in NS, NINA and St. John's Hospital. The hospital services in the Midwest were reconfigured in 2009 following expert advice that the EDs in NS, NINA were no longer safe for use. However, when centralization happened, nothing was put in place in UHL to prepare for the onslaught of patients that would inevitably come from NS, NINA and indeed from St. John's. This led to a decade of massive overcrowding, danger, peril, for people all across the Midwest in rural areas, in urban areas where we were depending from an area from Laura in North Terpory to Lahinch on the very west coast of Claire, depending on Wun, underfunded, understaffed emergency department service to look after emergency care. Emergency care in the whole region.
