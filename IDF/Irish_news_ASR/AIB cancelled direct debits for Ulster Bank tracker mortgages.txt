 Yet again, a bank in this country has made a blunder in relation to how it treats its customers. And it's A-I-B for the second time in less than two weeks. A-I-B has cancelled some of the direct debits used to pay mortgages. This is in relation to mortgages it bought from Ulsterbank. And it's had to apologize to customers, contact them and work out ways that it's going to allow them to pay their mortgages and also to set up new direct debits. It comes just two weeks after A-I-B had written out to large numbers of these Ulsterbank customers telling them that they weren't paying enough on their truck or mortgages. And so their monthly payments would have to go up by up to 600 euros. It quickly withdrew that letter and said it was a mistake and did a U-turn. And then last week we had Bank of Ireland. It had a mal function on its ATMs which meant people were able to get access to a thousand euros that they didn't have in their accounts. And then only on Monday evening we had this central bank admitting that it has made mistakes in relation to the central credit register, which registers whether or not people are paying their mortgages and other bills. It said it made a mistake in relation to that. So it's been a couple of weeks of blunders all around in terms of banking in Ireland.
