 In this week's Sunday Independent, 20 years since the crime that shook the nation, we reveal how the crime lords who plotted the death of Sunday Independent journalist Veronica Geeren got away with murder. And we mark her life and work in our special commemorative supplement. We talk to her friends and colleagues about her commitment and bravery in the face of personal intimidation and violence from the crime bosses who tried to silence her. The Sunday Independent, the complete lead.
