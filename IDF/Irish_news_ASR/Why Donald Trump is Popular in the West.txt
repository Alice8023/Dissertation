 What I've done with Trump is sweeping all before them in the Republican primaries and the Republican base seem to love him. He has fans here too, people might be surprised to hear, down on West hair. And also in the review we look at the Lewis Strike and the state of trade unions in Ireland. There's half many trade union members in Ireland now as well as in the 1970s. In the Saturdays weekend magazine our cover interview is with Irish actress Orla Brady who's starring in a new film The Price of Desire, a bit designer Eileen Gray. We're meeting the owners of some organic beauty companies and also the great Irish Bake Off contestant who's turned his love cake into a business and an extra it's fashion week so we've got a great 1930s jazz club swinging shoes which is really great fun and as well as that we're talking to designer Orla Kylie about her new jewelry line and going into the V&A archives with Oasis to see what patterns they've chosen for this season. Obviously the big game at the Evie Vestadium this Saturday between Lenscher and Monster I spoke exclusively to Ian Madigan this week about just why he's been wearing a pair of 1916 branded boots and it's an interesting story Alan Quinn and Tony Ward will be looking forward to that game and also we've got also a con act on Friday night so we're looking back analyzing what happened at Kingsman Stadium. In football Daniel McDonald is looking at Leicester City and just who are the journey men that have brought together this unbelievable story. And of course in Gated Games it's been built as this super Sunday across both football and hurling, Vincent Hogan in particular is going to be looking at the big game between temporary and clear so there will be plenty of reading for all sports fans on Saturday and New York's Independence. Saturday's Irish Independent it's your weekend.
