 Yeah, say a saber-saber with the axiotide blade, fine toothed blade here. Shockiness, huh? Can I say? There was a couple first of all, I just thought they'd been cut down by the cancel, but then it's a good 3040 that I saw it was shocked, it's disgusting. I mean, this pure nature, not gonna den, let's put brutal, brutal vandalism, there's absolutely no excuse for it. And anyone that uses this part is saying the same, we're on shock, it's disgraceful, absolutely disgraceful.
