 I've heard the rugby on the side, so Ireland and England. Can you just paint the wing and just like just wear it? Just like do a mallet take like when I was kind of a shock to me at least. You know, I'm gonna go with Ireland. I based on their performance in the Scotland game I think. I think I'm gonna go with Ireland, but I don't know about the soil usually. I think a lot of penalty kicks which makes it hard to guess. I'm gonna say to go wild gas and say 33 to 25. Wow. Hey, do you watch Durope? Yeah, I do. Who would you take the wing on Saturday? Ireland, of course. I watch it take to score, mate. 40 points, some different stuff. Another question if you follow Durope, we have the sex nations on. Ireland and England are playing on Saturday. Who's just saying hello? Obviously. Obviously Ireland. And would you be able to predict a score? I'm saying 20. I said 25. 12. I'm gonna do 15 here. I'm afraid it's more anywhere. So I think Ireland will win, but we can expect a bit of an English backlash after what happened to them last week. So what should we think for the score? Oh God. Hopefully we get a few tries. Well, it could be trading off. But for a way it's a set of rents and Patrick's weekend. Hello Durope. I do follow Durope. Who do you think will win on Saturday? I think Ireland will certainly win. By how many wins? I think we're trying to spoil the party, but I still think we'll win by 10 points.
