 denke violence against refugees against migrants it's people of color is following anti-refuge protests on the rise of far-rides ideas for scene this happened across your own everywhere you have either rise of the far right yet it percent physical assaults against migrants And we have to say honestly with a rise wide open that that is now happening in this country. The far right they do not care. They do not care about women. They are not concerned about women or children. They are using this concern as a smoke screen for spreading hate. Over 80% of women are killed by men that they are known to them. Over 63% of women in Ireland have been killed in their own homes. They are concerned for the safety of women and children. It is only relevant to the far right when it provides an opportunity to demonize, to attack, to harass and to oppress others. It is a pattern of what we see across Europe and where it is going is just as predictable as it is tragic unless it is stopped.
