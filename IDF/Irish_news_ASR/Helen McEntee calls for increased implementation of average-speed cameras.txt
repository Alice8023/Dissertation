 I'm sorry to have read about some of the road deaths and kind of foreign feelings. Would you prefer the wider road ash? The average speed kind of, you just have to get wide for that. Look, it's been a really, it's been a really awful summer when it comes to road death. We've seen a worrying trend, not in the right direction. We need to do everything that we can to reverse that trend. And it's looking at, I suppose, the key factors that results in many of these incident crashes and unfortunately death on our roads and tweeting is the top one. We have Go Say Fans where we've had an additional investment for the number of Go Say Fans that we have across the country. But I do think we need to look more at average speed cameras. If you look to Scotland as a jurisdiction from the population, similar road profile, they use average speed cameras much more. They have less of a road policing units, they use technology in a different way. And I think it's something that we need to look at and get in better shape on our actual meeting with a team from Scotland in the next month to just be ahead. How that might work, obviously we have two average speed cameras in front of the moment. The MOTAWI or the Fortone of Sari. And I think it's about 98%. So if you were to apply that to Turkey's right-of-the-road, we know our dangers, for the Blacks Park, I really think that would make a difference. I think we need to use technology in whatever way we can, whether it's fixed cameras, whether it's average speed cameras, whether it's Go Say Fans, we need to use technology and unhealthy to actually reverse the mitigation.
