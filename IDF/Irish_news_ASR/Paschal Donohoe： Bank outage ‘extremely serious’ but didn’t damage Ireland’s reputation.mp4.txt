 So this is a matter that the Minister for Finance has already recognized the importance of and he has asked the central bank to carry out an evaluation as to what has happened and what this means for the ability of bank of Ireland systems to function in the future. Customers have been able to access their accounts, been able to make use of ATMs and bank of Ireland apps are really, really important, not just for the functioning of businesses and also to allow households to pay their bills, but also for the broader trust that we continue to have to rebuild in how customers see the banking system overall. So what has happened in recent days is extremely serious and is of concern and the Minister for Finance has recognised that in the statement that he has made in calling on and asking the central bank to carry out an evaluation in relation to this, I very much welcomed that and I think that's really appropriate and important that that happens. I don't believe at all that our national reputation has been affected by this. It is the case that this is an issue that did attract a lot of coverage yesterday from in particular the business journalist community across the world, but I don't believe that that as an issue is something that is in any way affecting our national reputation. I mean we have three domestically based banks now that have seen a significant recovery in their value over the last number of years which is due to the recovery of the Irish economy, due to changes they have made and that is recognised by the global financial community. What happened yesterday is of course a really significant concern for Bank of Ireland. It's been recognised now by the Minister for Finance, but I don't believe it is of the level that it is affecting the reputation and economic reputation of Ireland.
