 Music For all of our families that are here today, it's a huge step forward in our campaign. Up until now, there's been no legal recognition or protection for children born through surrogacy. There are hundreds thousands of children who have been living in a legal limbo for years, for decades for some. And today marks one more step towards true equality with the publication of the report today that has 32 recommendations. And if those recommendations were taken and implemented into the next piece of legislation, the AH Orbil, so many children would finally have that legal connection to both of their parents. We actually came over from Sydney, Australia. We actually planned our trip around Publish of the report. It's some that lies very close to my heart. And obviously, I'm in a situation where if I want to come back to Ireland, then it might not be as easy as any other couple that have a family in Australia to come back. I think we've just taken a look at the report obviously this morning. I think it's a very thoughtful report. I think it's a very balanced report. What we want to do now is discuss it at a cabinet level, discuss it with government colleagues. A lot of pieces in the report, a lot of the recommendations are justice recommendations, rather than health recommendations. So I want to discuss it obviously with the line ministers and see where we go. We are just really hopeful that the government to do the right thing, take the recommendations. So much hard work has been leading to this moment. And come the fall, we have something that is ready to go. We cannot wait any longer. Our children cannot wait any longer. And even after we get this next piece of legislation for servicing, we still have more to do. There are still hundreds of LGBTQ plus families living in the same legal limbo. Thank you, children!
