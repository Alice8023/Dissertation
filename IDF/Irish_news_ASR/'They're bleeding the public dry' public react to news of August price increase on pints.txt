 Well, experiences I think they're taking the PI, you know, they've opted already. The bar-stituated, the bar-trend of Ireland is nearly on its knees. You know, people, since Covid, people have realised that staying at home is a lot more convenient, wouldn't you agree? And it's cheaper. You can't smoke in the pubs anymore. If you go out, you're looking at Â£7 for a pint anywhere on the south side of the Liffey. So, yeah, I think it's enough as enough. The only thing we have left is tourism in Ireland. And we're killing that as well. So, I love we get hand parties and we get all the things coming over from the UK. If they're going to be twice stout, we're going to be on our knees again. So, no, I think they, they, they, they realise is, they've already opted only for a year ago, less than a year ago. Six months ago, they've opted. And now they're trying to do it again. Enough is enough. They're really just pleading. The, the, the, the public draw. The only fund that you have as a weekend is going to meet your friends having a few points. And if they're going to bring that up again, when does it stop? When does it actually, when do they draw a line and say, okay, now we're going to level it off, you've hit the rules, that's it, you know? It's been going up ever since. Even after lockdown, everything's going up, up, up, up. And without a paper gun or a powder, folks, they're going to keep going up and they're going to force people into, back, bring the harm again. They want to walk from you again. If you want to go to a different home, for a team of boys and boys, you don't want to know that because you're drinking your raw clothes and your, your friends, you want to stay with your friends. That's what I like to do. No, that's why I will not call them a couple.
