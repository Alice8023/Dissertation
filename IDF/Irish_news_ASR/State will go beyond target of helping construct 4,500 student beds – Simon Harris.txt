 I genuinely think today is a massive day of performance, her level education you've heard me talk. Many times over the last two years about how we have developed, what I think is a bit of a national obsession, or at points, points, points in the CEO system. I think it's a huge amount of pressure on people that are relatively young and age-to-be, and about 80 secondary schools over the last 12 months. And there I have seen the pressure etched on the faces of young 17 and 18 year olds who often know what they want to do, know the career that they want, and we like it at the points. And I've been really clear that we have to have alternative pathways, alternative routes, and to getting to where you want to get to today, where launching the start of what we call a unify tertiary system, what does that mean? It means we're actually designing 13 programs where you'll be able to do half your degree in further education, and then automatically finish that degree in higher education. So no more is having to go into further education and hope if I work really hard, I might get a place in higher education with a bit of a lot of around that. And I actually know that I'm signing up for the 44-year degree. I can do two years in further education and then two years in higher education. I think that does a couple of things. I think one is does ease the pressure on our young people and mental health impacts the well-being effect as well. But I think secondly, it also recognizes another student is 17 or 18. And more and more people are going to want to access the education system in their 40s and their 50s and 60s and beyond. And actually packing the bags and then off to university for four years might be an option. But actually being able to go to the local college of further education for a few years might actually provide them with an option.
