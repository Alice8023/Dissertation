 Some people whose mortgages have been sold to Vulture funds are being hit with huge increases in the mortgage rate that they have to pay. People whose mortgages were sold to funds and are now managed by Mars Capital. Some of them are seeing mortgage rate increases of 1.6 percentage points. They're going to see their mortgage rate go to 6.5% from next month. Now, for some people, that's going to mean increases of around 200 euros a month, or about 2.5.000 euros increase in a year. Some of the mortgage holders have spoken to say they just can't cope with that kind of an increase. These are savage increases. We haven't seen increases like that before in the market. And it comes at a time when most of the conventional banks and lenders are actually cutting rates because they're engaged in a bit of a price war. And when the European Center Bank is about to cut rates, so it's extraordinary that people whose mortgages are sold off to Vultures are being hit with huge increases at the moment. Unfortunately, these people are forgotten mortgage holders. Their mortgages were sold when they got into some trouble. The banks packed them up and sold them off to funds and are managed by the like, the peppers, start, Mars Capital. And they have no control over what interest they can have. They can't get fixed rates, mostly on variable rates and tracker rates. So they're very exposed to changes in interest rates. And they really have been left hollow to dry.
