 COVID-related deaths in Ireland plummeted last year. Notified deaths for 2023 fell to 920, down from 2403 in 2022. Although the 2023 number may change slightly, it can take up to three months for cases we confirmed, it still represents a massive fall from the heights of the pandemic. The worst year for COVID-related deaths in this country was 2021 when there were 3,827 fatalities. In the first year of the pandemic in 2020, some 2,162 COVID-related deaths were reported with no vaccine available. Higher levels of immunity due to vaccination and previous infection, as well as less aggressive variants were behind the fall. Nearly four years since the start of the pandemic, there have been 9,358 COVID-related deaths in Ireland. The counties with the highest deaths rates are Mayo, Loud, Cavern, Monahan, Ross Common, Carlo, Limrich, Dublin, Dundigall, Waterford, Wexford and Claire.
