 Well, I don't think the flash track plan is the way to go with something like that. I mean, it's suddenly just going to appear, but now everybody seems to be objecting to a bullet that's still pushing a trail. It's a piece to be about another ballie morn, and cool, actually, I must be fair. If taken down, the high-roise apparently is a ballie morn, because they knew there was problems. And they're just putting these high-roise apartments somewhere else to cause the problem somewhere else. That's the thing about this country. Assholes. Assholes. Yeah. Assholes behind the desks, so having to clear what they're doing. It's always on top of the normal people, and the jammed people on top of each other. It's totally wrong with this. Some people have an issue with how many apartments are going in there, 470 do you think that's excessive? Sounds like a lot, isn't it? Sounds like a lot, and I know. This is a very settled area, you know, and having that many more added to the population, fairly quickly, isn't going to really work out, you know? Do you think it's going to affect traffic or...? Definitely so, yeah, whatever they do, it will affect the traffic is very bad around here at the moment. The need for housing is there, but do it properly, just plenty of fields and plenty of areas where they can be put in these housing states, and put them on building new housing states. Instead of putting them in families into the dog box apartments, and sharing them a colossal rent.
