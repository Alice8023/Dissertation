 My name is Judy Gurity. I'm the clinical midwife manager of the Barthine Suite here in CUM H and Clark and I'm delighted to say we've had seven healthy newborn babies born over last night in the labor ward and all the moms and babies are delighted to be part of the new family here in CUM H this morning and we continue to have more babies born this morning and as today goes on and I just like to wish them all a very healthy and a happy new year and to the whole community here in Clark.
