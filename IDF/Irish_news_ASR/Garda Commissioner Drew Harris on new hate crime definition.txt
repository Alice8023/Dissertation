 Well, I think you have to have to see these hate crime type events both non-crime and crime on a continuum. An individual's can suffer many sort of low grade low-key sort of incidents might be name-calling on the street etc. And a general harassment of them and we want to be clear then what exactly is happening and using that data then to drive not only our response but the response of other agencies. We want to have a better picture of the amount of hate type incidents, hate crime that there is in Ireland and that helps drive our response and gives us a better idea of what this societal problem is. We know there's under-reporting, we want to encourage reporting, we don't think victims should be able to say well is this a crime or is it not a crime? If there's something happens they feel uncomfortable with it, they feel threatened, they should report it to a guard of Shakona.
