 Irish secondary school students have experienced serious sexual harassment at the hands of their teachers. Over 200 people who attended Irish secondary schools took part in a new study, looking at sexual misconduct perpetrated by teachers against students in secondary schools. And over 360 UK students also took part in the study. Most of the people who spoke about their experiences were young women. The research was carried out by a number of universities, including University of Goalway, and it found that teenage girls have been touched and had their shirts opened by teachers in Irish schools. Others have reported having inappropriate sexual comments made about them when they were as young as 14 years old. One student who attended an Irish secondary school told researchers that it made her skin crawl now as an adult to remember how a teacher had grabbed her and licked her at a social event when she was 17. Many students said that their experiences of harassment were never reported to anybody, with some saying that the behaviour of teachers had seriously affected their education. Podrik Pinkila is a senior lecturer at University of Goalway and a co-author of the study. He said that it shed light on an important issue for the first time, and he said that staff who work in post-primey schools need to be supported to speak up and address staff, student, harassment if they ever encounter it.
