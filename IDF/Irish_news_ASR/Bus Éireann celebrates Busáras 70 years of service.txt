 So, hi, tell us about the view. In like 70 years, well, I'm interested today. So what has been its significant over the years? Well, this building has tremendous historical significance because it was conceived in the Cold Post War era and as the country was evolving, becoming a republic. So the government got together and the commission, and this particular building was opened by Sean Lamass back then at the time. And they engaged in the architect, a very renowned architect called Michael Scott. And really what they were trying to do is they designed the building that they thought was going to be a new modern emblem of what the new island was going to be. So it was very significant in that sense because we were surrounded by lots of fabulous buildings in Dublin, but they weren't of the new 20th century. So this was important because this was a new vision of the future for the 20th century. And Michael Scott brought some of that beautiful iconography, architecture, and art, and combined it in with functionality of being a great bus station. So it's Ireland's first purpose-built bus station and that's also of historical significance. Well, that's not the history. And what about the future? What is the future of bus hours? Well, it is because it's a great bus station. It's obviously carrying, we're here carrying over a million passengers per year. But this year alone, this has been the biggest year in Bosarian's history for carrying passengers. And we're anticipating further growth. So we have to look to not just the 70 years of this great building, but the next 70 years and say, how are we going to prepare for growth in the future? And we have to continue making this building for all. It is Dublin's only bus station. And it is a fantastic bus station. But we're carrying a million passengers. We're going to grow further and we also have to embrace sustainability. So the world is evolving. We're now going to be moving into the electric area, hydrogen buses, hybrid buses. And all of these things are all important developments because everybody's moving towards net zero. So we have to make sure a building like this is also moving in tune with the people, making it more accessible, and a place that's fit for everybody.
