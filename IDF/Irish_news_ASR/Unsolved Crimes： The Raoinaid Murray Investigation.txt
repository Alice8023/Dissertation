 For reasons the guards have never established someone way led, ran it in this landway and stopped her repeatedly. She didn't die at the scene, she was able to crawl another 40 or 50 yards, that's all, and then she expired just around the corner from her own home. I began working in Northern Ireland in the mid 1970s and the murders every single day. But I suppose the entire career I don't think any other murder has affected me, possibly because of the proximity. This weekend the Sunday Independent begins a series of reexaminations of murders that were high profile in their day and which still remain unsolved. We're looking at these murders and we're trying to ask the questions again. Are there people who knew what happened? Are there witnesses that never came forward? Are there people who know who the perpetrators are and who've been protecting them for whatever reasons? The series begins this weekend and continues over the coming weeks.
