 When T-Shitley of Radcar went out to the park last night, we should have been going to the country today. The people should decide on who our next T-Shuck is, not the assembled numbers here in government. The people should have their say, this should not be happening today, we should have gone to the country. So we do not agree to your schedule. Listen, the whole country is looking in. Can we please behave with a bit of decorum? Deputy Boyd Barrett. The business facing the country and the issues facing the country have been effectively driven off the agenda for the rest of the week. And that to me is unacceptable. There is going to be no, on the first day of the new T-Shucks ascension into office, there will be no leaders questions, there will be no T-Shucks questions, a debate on disability has been bumped off the agenda, questions on finance, have been bumped off the agenda. That is not the way to start a new government. It is not acceptable. And I think just because we are having this January today is not a reason to take business off the agenda, which is of extreme importance to ordinary people in this country. It is not appropriate to describe the election of a T-Shuck as a January. Let us have a guard and respect for our constitution and for the role that we play here. This is not, I assure you, a January. Deputy McGraw.
