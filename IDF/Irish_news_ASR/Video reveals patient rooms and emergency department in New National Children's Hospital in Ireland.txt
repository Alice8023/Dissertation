 We're delighted to show you these new rooms today and what you will see is an example of the highest international clinical standards in terms of patient rooms. We're very proud of the clinical standards that these rooms will achieve, but also really proud of the level of engagement that we've had with the patients and their families and how that has contributed to the design of all the details and the features within our families. The demonstration rooms are a very important milestone in the new children's hospitals. The reason why they're important is that our staff can actually come and familiarise and train in what are going to be the like facilities and also we have to make some decisions around equipping the hospital. So having the rooms means that we can actually test them in a real life environment before moving to the new children's hospital. The rooms are far more comfortable than the current rooms. They are just even in terms of the furnishings, more supportive, more robust, but you also have more space around you, much brighter and area. In the near room, my favourite feature would be the iPad because your phone can only entertain you for so long and so can a book. So just having an iPad does just there and you can order food from it, that's just really cool. My first impression is that it's really bright, it's very positive. It looks like a great place we're going to be able to work in. I'm really excited to tell my colleagues about it and I can't wait for that. At the core of our design concerns is patient safety. We want patients to feel safe and we want them to be safe. So we implement the highest standards of infection control, really important in the post-COVID era. There is a huge difference between the rooms that we have in the demonstration rooms and many of the facilities we have in Crumbland, Temple Street and Tala. Main differences is the sheer size. As we know in the new children's hospital it's all 100% inpatient single rooms with their own ensuite and a dedicated space actually for the parents to be able to comfortably sleep. That is not what we have at the moment. So these facilities afford us an opportunity now, a few years out to demonstrate and show what's going to be available for children, staff and families in our new children's hospital.
