 There's wider issues as well that we have to examine and look at in terms of particularly young teenagers and young people who engage in violent activity. Be it in a gang formation, randomly attacking people, which has occurred and the hurtable people have been randomly attacked in other parts of the country, in Kork and elsewhere, just randomly attacked on our streets. And that is that acceptable. That can happen periodically in society. The strategies have been deployed which can deal with them, but they're generally multi-fast strategies. That's just a boat, here at the University of Oblifings, after that comes world. Gementia visibility, this attack on this American tourist haven't meters away from the biggest guard section in Dublin. We've also seen that the numbers of Guaradi in North East and North City Dublin, it's down 4% to what it was at the end of the year. Surely that is all caused by the concern that the numbers aren't being managed properly. Well again, as I said, there was an introduction in terms of recruitment to Guaradi over the last two to three years. Where they being allocated properly, like what you do. People retire, people and so on. So if we had the same truth as we would have expected, so we'd forwarded, but forwarded, it dropped down. We probably would have at least kept even Steven in terms of sent the numbers. The population is increasing. I mean, this isn't the question of resources. In terms of funding resources, we have allocated funding resources. And we haven't the problem of the care target in terms of Guaradi numbers. We want to increase Guaradi nights. And there is an issue around the department of existing resources. But there's a wider issue as well in terms of, I think, the increased level of drug activity keeping participating in drugs. And then subsequently getting very violent. And that is something we have to tackle also.
