 So our history teaches us that independent journalism is absolutely essential for our democracy to survive. But what we're seeing in recent times is that journalism can bring out a huge pressure from those who want to weaponize our courts to silence journalism. That that independent journalism is essential so that we can make informed decisions but also hold people in power to account. And when those courts have been used to silence those journalists, that is a threat to our democracy. So what I want to do is reform our defamation laws and get a pass in the lifetime of this storm to give those journalists the comfort and the safety they need to be able to publish and say what they need to. So we can make those informed decisions but as importantly, hold those with power to account for what they are doing.
