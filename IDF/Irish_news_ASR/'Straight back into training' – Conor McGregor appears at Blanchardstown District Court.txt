 152iv. Nihu, komit. Straight back into the train in my mind, eh? What the fuck, are you doing? Just going to be honest. Do you do back trains today, Connor? Straight back into the train in the down here. Straight back in, I'm looking forward to getting back into the office. Have you had a phone with him, man? See what happens with my mind, you know? Straight back in, the legs getting better every day, so I'm happy with that. Can you do the one move? See what happens. I think 170. That's where I'm aiming for. I feel good at this week. Hopefully next, hopefully next. I'm on the way to the gym right now, my man. There you go. Turn around. Turn hard. Turn hard, man. Thank you, sir. Let's go. Connor, give him that spring. Gary's again. I wish him well. He's in the space, and all the right king's in is. And I mean, he's hitting all the right boaters. But, eh, he hits the boat with a chin best, so I'm excited to see him back in there. Representing Ireland. Nice. Just make a little longer, guys. Sorry. Out there. Terce.
