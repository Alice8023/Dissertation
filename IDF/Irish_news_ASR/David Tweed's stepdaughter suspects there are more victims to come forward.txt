 The stepdaughter of Peterfile rugby star and one-time unionist, Councillor David Tweed, believes some of his victims are yet to come forward. Amanda Brown, who was abused by Tweed from the age of 8 to 15, said it's more than likely his tally of victims goes beyond the women who are known to the family. Miss Brown and four of Tweed's daughters, first when public about their father, describe in him as a predatory pitophile and violent talk. After he was killed in a motorcycle accident in 2021. Speaking to the Irish independent this week, Miss Brown described how their abuse drove her to plan suicide. Years later, her cousin Gemma, who was also abused by Tweed, took her own life. Miss Brown said he is responsible for Gemma's death. She added Gemma couldn't take it, she couldn't live with the pain, she said. She also said she believes Tweed abused more women who have yet to come forward and that she would be very surprised if there aren't. Amanda Brown has written a book about the years of sexual abuse Tweed subject to her two as a child and her journey to recovery. No peace until his death is published today.
