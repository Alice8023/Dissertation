 But can you just ask in relation to the revelations at all, see in relation to non-disclosed payments, but your reaction has been so far? Well, I think it's a first of all, I think it's a huge shock and surprise of what has transpired in terms of the manner of this. I think we need more clarification. I think the minister is meeting with the Chair of the Board, I don't think I already know the next week, and I would think we need comprehensive clarity or on the same explanation as to what transpired. I think particularly in the area of transparency, this is a breach of trust in terms of the public presentation of the figures as opposed to the re-energy of the figures. That is serious, particularly because I think it relates to governance with the Norte and given its unique role as a public service broadcaster to our views required in all aspects of this, the role of commercial sponsors in such a facture of clothing and the standard-based sponsorship is there, but none that is there are questions.
