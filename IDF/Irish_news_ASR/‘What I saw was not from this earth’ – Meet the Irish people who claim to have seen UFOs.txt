 It was 3.50 am on a Sunday morning and outside for a cigarette. When I turned on my right, I seen the triangular shaped black object. No sound, with a red dome underneath. As I tried to get my camcorder out, I only cut it as it flew off. I was numb, amazed. And I knew it wasn't ours. I knew it, like I mean, it was in the army. I know what a helicopter is, a drone, a plane, a scene all, but it was the sound most of all that anything could be just hovering 20 feet off the ground and then just... What really my attention was the night before when I looked over towards Black Rock, there was like an orb and it kept moving erratically. It would fall, it would go back up, do circular. It was like it was performing. I've never told anybody only my two sons and my wife until now I'm 72 years of age and I thought I just have to get this out and tell somebody. It's a big universal day, I just don't think we are the only ones, so the people want to please that or not, it's entirely up to yourselves.
