 As you're aware very little Shane Rass has written a biography of himself and in it he has posed questions about the source of funding for the renovation of the family. I'm supposed to put you like to clarify those questions that he has posed in that book. How did you pay for the renovation at your home? And also, why didn't you cooperate with the book? You may have heard Shane Rass's priority in undertaking the project and you decided in the end that you certainly asked him to consult with people that he didn't want to cooperate with the book. Why didn't you? And who did you consult with? So, you see, Shane Rass writing a book about me is a bit like, is a bit like me and my summer holidays deciding that I'd write a book on the T-shirt and then giving them a ring in saying, would you like to go up or isn't giving me an interview? I mean, I, I, from the get go, I said to Shane, I just don't think that this is a project that I would be interested in being involved with. So, he's aware of that. I'm very lucky that we have a family home. I'm really conscious of that there's lots of people who can't say that. We have a single home, our family home in Cabra. We pay for it the way all working people pay for their family home. We have a mortgage and we're still paying it folks and we'll be paying it for quite some time. That's it. That's that's the beginning, the middle and the end. We suggest the renovation when it costs several hundred thousand euro. Would you like to have a mic? I'm going to suggest what he wants. It's my family home. The single home that we have, that we've raised our kids and we have a mortgage on it. We pay our mortgage, we pay our bills, we pay our Jews. That's who we are, like all other working people. That's it. That's the story.
