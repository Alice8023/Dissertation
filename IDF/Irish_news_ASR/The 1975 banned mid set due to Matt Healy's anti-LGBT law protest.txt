 I'm in a mistake. When we were pumpkin shares I wasn't looking into it and then I don't see the point. I do not see the point of inviting the 1975 to a country and then telling us who we can have sex with. I don't care anymore. If you push I'm going to push back. I'm not in the f***ing mood. I'm not in the f***ing mood. If you film in this on TikTok I'm not in the f***ing mood anymore. I'm sort of tick-tocked the other day. Where I picked up a child that I love who's a friend of mine, a friend of mine's child and I put them down and there was a tick-tock conversation as to whether my finger placement was appropriate. So what we're just casually accusing people of being a pedophile now are we for entertainment? Is that what we're doing? No? No? What f***ing looks like it? I'm not having to go at you as people film in this. It looks like it. You don't casually insinuate that. I'm not in the f***ing mood anymore. Unfortunately you don't get a set of loads of fartlifting songs because I'm f***ing curious. And that's not fair on you because you're not representative of your government. Because you're a young people and I'm sure there are a lot of you again and progressive and kind. So I called the show yesterday. I called this show yesterday and we had a conversation and we said, you know what? We can't let the kids down because they're not the government. But I've done this before. I've gone to a country where it's been f***ing, I don't know what it is, ridiculous. F***ing ridiculous. To tell people what they can do with that and that. And if you want to invite me here to do a show, you can f***ing. I'll take you money, you can bang me. But I've done this before and it doesn't feel good. And I'm f***ing. F***ing ridiculous. F***ing ridiculous. F***ing ridiculous. F***ing ridiculous. F***ing ridiculous.
