 So we're thinking the other day, who are some of our favorite guests? Well, one of our all-time favorites is the chicken lady, Tara Sawheim. We've had her on a bunch of times. We decided, you know, one on Inviter In for an hour-long conversation on Tucker Carlson today, and we're so glad that we did, because she turns out to be a very cool person. We talked to her not just about chickens, but a whole bunch of things, including alcohol and white shells and drink and et cetera. So here's part of the conversation. In a world where everyone drinks casually, why do you not drink? You know, I just don't see the good in it. It's expensive, it's not good for your body. A lot of people make bad decisions when they drink, and I'm like, not today, Satan. Not doing that. I'm not going down that path. So I've avoided it, and honestly, it's worked out for me. It works out. It does actually. It does work out. I completely agree with you. I don't need it. I don't want it. Would there ever social pressure to... People always will ask me, they'll be like, oh, like, why don't you drink? And I'm like, oh, you know, personal reasons. And I'm like, oh, are you Mormon? And I'm like, no, I'm not Mormon. And they're like, oh, like, you know, are you recovered alcoholic? And I'm like, no, I just don't want to do it. That's a little off topic for a political show. We'll admit that at the outset, but the chicken lady is great, and we're really glad to interview her, and we think you'll be glad to watch that interview. FoxNation, 70M tomorrow.
