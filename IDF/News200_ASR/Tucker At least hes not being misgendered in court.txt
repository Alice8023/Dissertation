 So you remember Sam Brinton, he was the world famous MIT train nuclear waste disposal expert who ran the program for Joe Biden. Well, he's in court today. He's accused of stealing ladies' underwear in their luggage at a bunch of different airports, presumably wearing it. It's not weird, by the way, don't judge. Today he was an ordinary hearing for stealing a $2,000 bag from the airport in Minneapolis. Brinton's lawyers had filed multiple requests for him to attend the hearing remotely, saying he's having him recording employment issues. He sure is. The judge denied that request, but the judge did accommodate a far more significant demand from Sam Brinton. He went along with Brinton's request to be called MX. We're not going to guess now that I pronounce it. MX Brinton, instead of Mr. Brinton. So the bottom line is our gender fluid nuclear waste expert friend may be going to jail for up to five years, and he may not have a job, but at least he's not being misgendered.
