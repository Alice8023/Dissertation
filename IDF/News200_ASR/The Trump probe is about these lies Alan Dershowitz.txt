 When Dershoetz, formerly of Harvard, author of Get Trump, the threat to civil liberties, do process in our constitutional rule of law. And Dershoetz joins us tonight. Fesh, thank you so much for coming on. And with that introduction, I do think you're a credible assessor of the case against the Republican frontrunner in New York. What do you make of it? Well, first of all, I just got a tweet or a note from Donald Trump himself in which he endorsed my book, or just everybody to read it, but he says, Alan enjoys saying, I didn't vote for Trump. I believe he probably did. He just uses that phrase for added credibility, but it doesn't matter. He's a brilliant guy, and you should read his book. No, I didn't. I never mixed politics and my constitutional analysis. Get Trump is a book about lying. It's all about lying. It's about the four lies that have resulted in four investigations, including doctoring a tape, which is, of course, what the January 6th Committee did when it left out the words, peacefully and patriotically. It's about Michael Cohn, who may be the world's biggest liar. He gets all the panochios. And the district attorney has making a very hard decision now. Does he put his bar at risk, his bar certificate at risk? By putting on the stand, the man he knows is going to lie in violation of the rules of ethics. So it's all about lying. My book get Trump documents lie after lie. The left, the so-called liberals, they're not liberals, they're radicals. No, it is. We'll do anything. Stretch the Constitution, destroy the Constitution, to prevent Trump from running for president. And it's degrading to our country and to all of us. I appreciate you writing this book. I know you paid quite a personal cost for saying things like this. And we appreciate you're coming on. I'll undershort. Thanks. Thank you.
