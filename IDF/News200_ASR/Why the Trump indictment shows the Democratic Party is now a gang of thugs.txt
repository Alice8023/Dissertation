 Harmony Dillon is obviously a famous civil rights attorney. She's highly familiar with this case and we have to ask why did a judge load cameras into the court to take pictures of Trump normally you see sketches that seemed like part of a strategy a political strategy not a legal one. Harmony Dillon thank you for coming on what did you make of that? Well I agree with you Tucker I mean if the Democratic Party is using this prosecution which I believe they are to influence the outcome of the next election this photograph is going to be a prop in those campaigns and it all seems to be you know really well targeted towards that. I would even say that the judge not putting a gag order on both sides in this case is the same because by by scolding the defendant and saying you better stay away from an imaginary line that I'm not going to draw for you he's effectively chilling his speech while at the same time not putting any constraints whatsoever on the district attorney who could go out and in fact completely ignore his his oath to do justice and pre-judge that the defendant has already guilty said that multiple times in his remarks while winking and at the same time admitting that he didn't even have to articulate what the charges are. So this entire proceeding seems to be clearly rigged in a political manner and somewhere along the way Tucker Americans may have not noticed that the Democratic Party has basically turned into a gang of thugs. There is no concept of due process there is no concept of even with a straight face attempting to tie the charges to something that you can prove in front of a court of law that could stand up on appeal and so if there were ever any more evidence than than we already suspected I think the way that today's proceedings went really underscores the political nature of this and if I wouldn't make a comment about the president's remarks today I would say that what was missing from that is pointing out that this indictment is really aimed at the American people it's aimed at President Trump supporters it's aimed at terrorizing people away from supporting a particular candidate and it is meant to remind all of us that if they can do this to a former president they can concoct false charges without even articulating what the charges are against any American for political reasons and that is a form of emotional terrorism Tucker it should really be terrifying to all Americans that this is the current state of the law in New York City. You should say that in every public appearance going forward I agree with that Harmington thank you so much.
