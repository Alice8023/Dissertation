 10% of Americans have depression. They tell you it's all chemical imbalance in the brain. That's a lie. Some of it may be. But depression is also a product of living a life you're not supposed to be living. And if your mercenary wife and all the political consultants around you tell you you have to be in the US Senate and you don't want to be in the US Senate, you're not ready to serve in the US Senate, maybe it gives you depression. That's not crazy, actually, as an explanation. Those people should have to answer for it, who did this damn. So it's kind of interesting that you're not hearing our leaders talk that much about black people anymore. Remember all the neoliberals were obsessed with telling you about black people? Why aren't they talking about black people anymore? Three years after George Floyd, actually the lives of many African Americans, real people have gotten a lot worse. Following the 2020 Floyd briots, African American deaths by homicide reached levels never seen before in this country. Someone should stop and ask, why is that? No one in the Democratic Party is because they don't care, they don't have to care because they have a new class of victims to exploit for political power. Out with black people and with transgendarists, we're going to exploit their suffering to become more powerful. Of course, big corporations are taking the lead as they always do. Bud Light just honored a man who dresses up like a little girl called Dylan Mulvaney. Watch this. I got some Bud Light for us. So I kept hearing about this thing called March Madness and I thought we were all just having a hectic month, but it turns out it has something to do with sports. And I'm not sure exactly which sport, but either way it's a cause to celebrate. This month I celebrated my day 365 womanhood and Bud Light sent me possibly the best gift ever, a can with my face on it. So do you think that the people in charge care about that person or any transgender person? Really, if they did, they might ask questions like, is the suicide rate among young people who are getting hormone treatments rising or falling? Because if you cared, you'd want to know that. They don't want it. They don't care. You think Sandy Cortese even thinks about that? No. The point is getting power from the suffering of others. And if you've decided you're another sex, you're definitely suffering on many, many levels. But point that out and you get attacked. That happened to our friend Billboard Chris in Canada. He went to a trans rally in Vancouver on Friday. Here's what happened to him while there. You suck, you suck, you, you, you're not wanted, you, you're a idiot, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, heh. So who's the aggressor there? Well, it wasn't the man who calls himself Billboard Chris. He was assaulted. And when he reported his assault to the air quotes here, police, the police refused to investigate. seconds I was surrounded not allowed to walk freely pushed as you can see my nose is bleeding they just walked up to him and assaulted me you want to see I don't where's the video I haven't on my camera but I'm gonna show it to you yeah I can back him show it to you how about you show it to me are you gonna do something about it if I do if I actually see other salt and not play with an assault or your nose no I think that happened then you think you did it to himself it's open people can do these things to hurt themselves on purpose you don't honestly think that's a bad idea thinking I spread myself on purpose is hilarious oh the rosy cheeked face of tyranny she could be working in the city bank HR department maybe she will be someday and she's not the only one the police chief the deputy police chief rather Howard Chau of Vancouver has taken her side he says he's a Paul not the people being bashed in the face for their political views but because some people don't like the fact the police didn't respond he hasn't condemned the militants who attacked that man that's because in Canada as in this country militants with the right cause the trans cause can do whatever they want that he can even kill Christian children in school and they're they're the victims subscribe to the Fox News YouTube channel to catch our nightly opens stories that are changing the world and changing your life from Tucker Carlson tonight
