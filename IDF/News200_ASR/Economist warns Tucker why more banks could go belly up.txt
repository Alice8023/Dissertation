 70 Palm Boy found a macro maven she joins us to kind of untangle the insanity here I'm not you know Stephanie, I have to say you're one of the very few people who called this early and said they're gonna be tragic and distorting effects of flooding the American economy with fake money from the Federal Reserve and I think I think you're right Yeah, well it was hardly a radical conclusion to draw when you Slather on layers and layers of debt on an economy And encourage people to take reckless risk and then you Ratch it up interest rates at the fastest rate in history. I mean God knows we the the surprises that it took this long for the bodies to flow to the surface and Honestly Tucker this banking thing is particularly remarkable because of the level of impunity That the banks evidence and you've talked about you know this whole diversity equity inclusion and the in the woe Cajenda and this idea that you know banking doesn't need to be boring You know you used to want to get away from the banker at the cocktail party now You see no throwing confetti and he's got a lampshade on his head and use the life of the party But the reality is these problems at Silicon Valley Bank and signature, you know their pursuit of these woe Cajendas may make them let's hope Exceptional. I mean hopefully they're these videos aren't pervasive to the entire banking sector Although they may very well be but ultimately the entire banking sector did the same thing And that is that they watched their deposit base with their over the last 12 months while the Fed was raising interest rates Because people like you and me looked at it and said why am I putting my money in the banking getting zero When I can buy a Treasury bill and get three four five percent as the Fed kept raising rates So their deposit base was shrinking at the same time all those assets that they held that you talked about last night The Treasuries and whatnot were declining and value and they sat there and they did nothing about it Tucker And they didn't just do that for one month or two months, which might be excusable But six nine months go by and the problems are getting worse and worse and they did nothing Why did they do nothing because they knew all along when this day came the bailout would be there for them So the impunity of the banking system is beyond but they've been taught there no consequences for mismanagement and this ridiculous You know all these ridiculous woke priorities which have you know You should actually when someone comes in and presents a business idea and wants a loan You should be looking at whether it's a viable business model not whether it's you know some sweaty teenager and a hoodie With some hair-brained scheme that you can throw money yet without consequence But this is where we are and and sadly I think we're just at the beginning of this because the companies that SVS VB and these other banks Let money to are all going to go belly up just like the clients of SVB started to do Hopefully they'll spare us the moral lectures. They already pay half the tax rate We'd be in a lot of cases. It's it's a little it's a little much I would say 70 pablo. I appreciate your coming on site.
