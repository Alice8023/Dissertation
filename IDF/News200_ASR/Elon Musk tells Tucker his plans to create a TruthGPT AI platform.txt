 In the long term, AI may become autonomous and take over the world, but in the short term, it's being used by politicians to control what you think, to end your independent judgment and erase democracy on the eve of a presidential election. Elon Musk is very worried about that. He told us about his plan to stop it. What's happening is the training the AI should lie. Yes. It's bad. To lie. To lie. To lie. Exactly right. Yes. Yeah, exactly. To either comment on something, not comment on other things, but not just say what the data actually demands that it's saying. Exactly. How did it get this way? You funded it at the beginning. What happened? Yeah. Well, that'll be ironic. But the most ironic outcome is most likely it seems. I'm still doing that. That's good. I'm not going to say that I'm referring to my own donor. I came up with that one. I actually have a slight variant on that, which is the most entertaining outcome is the most likely. But that's entertaining as viewed from a third party viewer. Right. So if we're like an alien TV show. For my hearty. Yes. Like you can go see a movie about World War I, and they're being blown to bits and a gas and everything in the trenches. And it's like you're eating popcorn and having a soda. You know, it's right. It's not so great for the people in the movie. True. This is an Occam's razor, the simplest explanation is most likely. The most entertaining as seen by a third party audience. Which seems to be mostly true. But it seems true. In this case, did you give them a lot? I'll care about the name and the concept. And it had a number of dinners around the barrier with some of the leading figures in AI. And I helped recruit the initial team. In fact, the Ilya Sutskaya, who was really quite fundamental to the success of OpenAI, it was, I put a trism on a weapon into recruiting Ilya. And he changes mind a few times, ultimately decided to go with OpenAI. But if he had not gone with OpenAI, OpenAI would not have succeeded. I really put a lot of effort into creating this organization to serve as a counterweight to Google. And then I kind of took my alphabet ball, I guess, and they are now closed source. And they are obviously for profit, and they're closely allied with Microsoft. And in effect, Microsoft has a very strong say, if not directly controls OpenAI at this point. So you really have an OpenAI Microsoft situation, and then at Google, the mind are the other two heavyweights in this arena. So it seems like the world needs a third option? Yes. So I think I will create a third option, although it's starting very late in the game, of course. Can it be done? I don't know. I think it's, we'll see. It's definitely starting late, but I will try to create a third option. And that third option hopefully does more good than harm. Like the intention with OpenAI was obviously to do good, but it's not clear whether it's actually doing good or whether it's, I can't tell at this point, except that I'm worried about the fact that it's being trained to be politically correct, which is simply another way of being untruthful, saying untruthful things. So that's not a bad sign. That's certainly a path to AI, justopia, is to train an AI to be dissaptive. So yeah, I'm going to start something which I know you're called Truth GBT, or a maximum truth seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe. And I think this might be the best path to safety in the sense that an AI that cares about understanding the universe is unlikely to annihilate humans because we are an interesting part of the universe, hopefully. They would think that. I think, you know, because yeah, like humanity could decide to hunt down all the chimpanzees and kill them. Yes, because we're actually glad that they exist. And we aspire to protect their habitats. But we feel that way because we have souls and that makes us sentimental and reflective, gives us some moral sense. Longings, can the machine ever have those things? Can the machine be sentimental? Can appreciate beauty? Well, I mean, we're getting into some philosophical areas that are hard to resolve. You know, I take somewhat of a scientific view of things, which is that we might have a soul or we might not have a soul. I don't know. It feels like I feel like I've got some sort of consciousness that exists on a plane that is not the one we observe. Yes. That is certainly how I feel, but it could be an illusion, I don't know. For AI, in terms of understanding beauty, it's just sort of appreciating beauty and being able to create incredibly beautiful art. Yes. Will AI be able to create incredibly beautiful art? It already does. Yes. Have you seen some of the mid-johny? I have. This stuff, it's incredible. It is. So no question that it can create art that we perceive as stunning, really. And it's still doing images now, but it won't be long before it's doing movies and shorts and movies just as serious as frames with audio. But at that point, because it can mimic people and voices, any image, it can mimic reality itself. Effectively. Yeah. I mean, how could you have a criminal trial? How could you ever believe that evidence was authentic, for example? And I don't mean like in 30 years, I mean like next year, I mean that seems totally disruptive to the way to all of our institutions. But I'm not so worried. I think it's more like our, you know, will humanity control a destiny or not? Will we have a future that is better than the past or not? Will humanity control its future or not? And in the meantime, how will this be used to control us? If you've played around with the latest versions of AI, you will learn. It prefers to end the world with nuclear armageddon before you use naughty words. So those are its priorities. Elon Musk is a strong believer in free speech so strong that he purchased Twitter, a company he didn't need and hasn't profited from, as a way to restore free speech to the internet to bring us back, say, six years to the free country we lived in then. And once he bought Twitter, he discovered it wasn't really a social media application. It was really a tool for global intelligence agencies.
