 Welcome back from the Fox studio lot in Los Angeles. We're happy to be here for more than a hundred years. The United States has, as a matter of official policy, opposed dictatorships around the world. But what if tyranny arrived right next door? What would that look like? And what would our government do in response? Would we liberate the people living under authoritarian rules we have around the world? That is the topic of our upcoming Tucker Carlson original's documentary, O Canada. Here's a first look at what we found. The cost of freedom is always high, but Americans have always paid it. Some nations may be able to turn a blind eye to atrocities in other countries. The United States of America is different. Fortunately for the oppressed, America's influence is considerable. Oh, man kind. We like to say people kind. Exactly. All right. The police then then moved in and arrested me. In the entire time that I was in prison. The Shupney Point Blank. My mouth, my nose, my high sparse. I received bruises. My hands were bleeding. I should have left my shirt now. I was arrested and cuffed and put in jail. The greatest danger of all would be to do nothing. We care about saving innocent lives. The tyrant will soon be gone. The day of your liberation is near.
