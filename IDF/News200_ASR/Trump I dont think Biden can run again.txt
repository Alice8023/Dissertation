 Do you think Biden will stay in the race? Look, I watch him just like you do. And I think it's almost inappropriate for me to say it. I don't see how it's possible. But this is something wrong. I saw his answer today on television about whether or not he was going to run to a very nice guy named Al Roker. I mean, you can't get a softer question than that. That was a long answer talking about the eggs and the this and that look. I don't think he can.
