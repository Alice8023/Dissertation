 A horrifying hit and run near the Dallas Fort Worth airport, a driver ramming into two cyclists, the vehicle appearing to stop briefly before running over one of the victims. Police now using this video in their investigation. If he had driven six inches to the right, I'd be a good man. Tom Geppert was the man run over. I just go into the back of the group to get a little break when the car hit me. Pushing me forward and falling to the right is the last thing I remember. He suffered a concussion, but otherwise only minor injuries. Investigators say the driver of that white SUV, 31-year-old Benjamin Highlander, was chased down by other bikers before he was taken into custody by airport police. He faces multiple charges, including DWI, an aggravated assault. As for Geppert, he has a message for drivers who feel inconvenienced by bikes on the road. Just everyone remember that when they feel thankful, it is a person. And a person is a father, a mother, a grandparent. Yeah, he says he's grateful to be okay and he spent last night with his grandkids.
