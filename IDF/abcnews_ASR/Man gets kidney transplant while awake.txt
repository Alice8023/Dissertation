 This morning a medical milestone in Chicago. Are you awake, John? 28-year-old John Nicholas is now the first patient at Northwestern Medical to undergo a kidney transplant while fully awake. It's just a boost of energy to the team to be able to look back and say we potentially change the way that kidney transplant can be done. Instead of general anesthesia, which is typically used for this surgery, doctors gave Nicholas a single spinal anesthesia shot, similar to what it's used during a C-section. The entire procedure was performed in less than two hours. We placed a spinal in the operating room with a little of a sedation, and then that was the main anesthetic. It was incredibly simple and uneventful. The revolutionary surgery paving the way for life-saving kidney transplants in patients who can't have general anesthesia while also cutting hospitalization for kidney transplants from three days to just 24 hours. We have an incredible gift to a friend, as always, a good feeling in your heart. That's 29-year-old Pat Wise. Nicholas is donor and best friend since elementary school. Wise says when he got a text about donating, he didn't hesitate to sign up. We've always said to each other that we're right or die friends, and that we're always kind of with each other for life, but actually having such a bonafide example where we've got each other's back, like it just meant the world to me. Wow, what an incredible story. And now Northwestern is looking to establish a new program for patients who also need a kidney transplant without general anesthesia.
