 And now to the millions of Americans hitting the roads and the skies for this holiday weekend. Triple A is projecting more than 70 million people are traveling this July 4th week. While the TSA says it's expecting to screen a record number of passengers over the next few days. ABC News, Victor Akendo is at Miami International Airport tracking all of that for us. And Victor, we have to say Miami is one of the top travel destinations for the 4th of July. So what's the TSA expecting there? And how are the roads looking so far? Well, Diane today is expected to be a little bit quieter, but TSA is expecting a record crush of travelers in the days ahead. Triple A, as you said, projecting more than 70 million people will be on the move this holiday. The most ever TSA scene we could see the most passengers ever this weekend. While there are about 30,000 planes in the skies today, that number jumps to 46,000 tomorrow as travel ramps back up. Sunday will be the big day to head back home. Some tips for those taking to the skies, get to the airport early, carry on your luggage to avoid those lines. Make sure to check your flight status and keep an eye on the weather. The bulk of travel will be on the roads. As Triple A predicts, 60.6 million people will travel by car this holiday. Sunday, again, will be the busiest on the roads. For your best chance at avoiding traffic, you want to leave before 11 a.m. on the bright side, travel gas prices lower than the national average this time last year, around $3.51 a gallon. Diane? All right, Victor, Kendo. Thank you.
