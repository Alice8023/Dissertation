 Fecal soup is referring to the fact that these manure storage basins are overflowing and along with all kinds of other pollutants that are being picked up by the flood waters, creating this disgusting mess. There's a lot of livestock, a lot of these facilities that have these large manure storage systems. When there's a lot of water that is entering these manure storage systems, it can overtop the storage that is available. So these storage basins are only built to accommodate so much manure and water at one time. There's this bacteria contamination as well as high nitrate levels that are of real concern. So in the short term, folks need to find alternate sources of drinking water, bottled water, because their water treatment systems are just not able to handle the contamination at this moment. The flood waters will receive at some point and most of that contamination will be carried downstream. Unfortunately, so it'll head into the Mississippi River and eventually to the Gulf of Mexico, which is where we see the impacts with the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. So really, it's just a matter of allowing the flood waters to carry away all of the contamination that it has kind of brought forth.
