 This morning, Sean Diddy-Kohms faces new sex trafficking allegations. In a lawsuit filed yesterday, former porn star, Adrienne English, claims she was trapped in a cycle of sex trafficking she never asked to be a part of because defended Kohms knew he could groom her. English says she met Kohms in 2004 while performing at a New York strip club. She claims he offered her boyfriend a job if she danced at Diddy's parties. English claims she was co-washed into using alcohol and drugs at those events before being sexually assaulted by various guests. This is at least the 10th lawsuit filed against Diddy alleging physical abuse and sex trafficking. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing. His ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura has accused him of rape and abuse. His former producer Rodney Jones claims Diddy repeatedly sexually assaulted him, and a federal investigation is looking into allegations of human and sex trafficking. Mountain lawsuits against Sean Kohms just creates more and more civil liability, more money that he might have to pay out if he loses. This latest lawsuit comes as TMZ reports Diddy is selling his Los Angeles mansion rated by the FBI earlier this year. The rap mogul hoping to make a serious profit reportedly asking $70 million for a home he paid $40 million for back in 2014. With her lawsuit, Adrienne English is seeking unspecified damages.
