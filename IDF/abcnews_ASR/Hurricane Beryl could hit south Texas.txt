 Let's go ahead and bring in Sam with the timing of the track and where this is all going, but you're also following the extreme heat that's playing a role here. Yeah, a lot of stuff going on, Geo. And so we were shocked by Burles growth and explosion in the warm waters of the Caribbean sea. Now we're losing strength on this storm as expected to the forecast. Look how far it is away from Jamaica. There's the Cayman Islands, so the Cayman's involved in this today, but already Jamaican much better looking skies. We'll watch this storm weaken in strength as it continues to move to maybe two hits in Mexico. Looking somewhere near Tulum is maybe a one here. Then it will lose strength as they all do moving across the U.K. Tampa, N.C. Now the Gulf waters, how warm is this? We just had a storm move through here, so it's not as hot as you think it might be. This means it will strengthen, but we could have a one and we need to see where it's going to go. So watch this high shift. That's the thing that's steering it. We use spaghetti models, but we don't look at the individual lines. We look at kind of the idea of where they all are. Look at this in that northeastern coast of Mexico. Also though, South Texas in play here. So we want to watch it very carefully. Meanwhile that high that's steering this storm is also trapping the heat. So here's where we have the excessive heat warnings and watches. I want you to look all the way to Washington, D.C. because D.C. and Philly are about to get into this. Brand new one moves into the West. Its duration is going to be what we're going to talk about. This is going to be tough for the West Coast guys. The longer it goes on, the more complicated it gets. Okay, Sam. Thank you. And we know you'll be back with us shortly to cover more of the country as well.
