 This morning, the man accused of killing seven people at the July 4th Parade in Highland Park, Illinois, has refused a plea deal, dashing the hopes of the victim's families who had hoped to avoid a trial. Today, you saw absolute unadulterated evil. This was a calculated effort on his part to continue the suffering that our clients are going through. Robert Kremow III had reportedly agreed to the deal, which involved pleading guilt to seven counts of murder and 48 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm. But instead, much to the surprise of a packed courtroom, the 23-year-old rejected it, meaning a trial will now be held in February. All I wanted was to be able to fully grieve my mom without the looming trial, knowing that he was going to spend the rest of his life in jail. I was hoping for closure. That was the goal for today to just be done with this. Investigators say back in 2022, Kremow had planned the attack for weeks before hiding on a rooftop and opening fire on the crowd below. The victims ranging in age from 8 to 88. Kremow then allegedly disguising himself as a woman to escape. That's what happens when you unlawfully place a gun in evil's hand you are going to get a reign of terror. This week, Highland Park will hold a 4th of July parade, its first since the shooting. My dad was somebody who loved his family and we've stuck together through all this and we're going to keep sticking together and being there for each other and just keep being there for each other through this whole trial. A motive still remains unclear. If convicted, Kremow III faces life in prison without the possibility of parole.
