This statement directly contradicting Netanyahu's goals is really military officials later walking back those comments.

The attacks at sea in protest of the war in Gaza. It comes as more anti-Semitic incidents make headlines around the world. In Paris, protesters in the streets after a barbaric attack on a 12-year-old Jewish girl and in New York City, police have released an image of the man wanted for making shocking anti-Israel remarks in a subway train that was taken over by Palestinian supporters.
