 Samuel Woodward committed hate crime first degree murder. This morning the California jury finding Samuel Woodward guilty in the hate crime killing of his former high school classmate Blaze Bernstein. No verdict can bring back Blaze. There will never be anyone quite like him. His gifts will never be realized or shared now. Back in 2018 Bernstein, a 19 year old gay Jewish Ivy League student went missing in Newport Beach. Over a week later his body was found in a park he visited with Woodward that night he went missing. He had been stabbed 28 times. We do believe Mr. Woodward was acting alone. Then out 26 year old Woodward admitted to the killing but prosecutors argued the murder was punishable as a hate crime, claiming Woodward, a member of a neo-Nazi group, killed Bernstein because he was gay and Jewish. But the defense argued the murder was a crime of passion, saying the two men had visited the park for a sexual encounter after meeting online. Woodward saying he was worried Bernstein had recorded the meeting and was going to out him as gay. Did Blaze do something that led to a sudden quarrel? And a deadly overreaction by Sam in the heat of passion? But prosecutors argued the murder was premeditated, saying Woodward even brought a symbol associated with his neo-Nazi group, a skull mask to the killing which was found with Bernstein's blood on it. Jerry agreed and now convicted of a hate crime, Woodward faces a sentence of life in prison without parole. This is a great relief the justice was served and this despicable human who murdered our son will no longer be a threat to the public. Sentencing is scheduled for October 25th.
