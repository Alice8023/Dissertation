 This morning actor, Army Hammer, speaking out in a candid podcast interview. The beleaguered star accused by several women of violent and inappropriate conduct, now discussing his life before and after the accusations. Where I was in my life before all of that stuff happened to me, I didn't feel good. I never felt satisfied. In 2021, Hammer was accused of sexual misconduct, including cannibalism fantasies and rape after an anonymous Instagram account posted purported text messages with various women. He was never charged, but two of his exes participated in a documentary detailing the alleged abuse. I mean, he said I'm 100% a cannibal. I'm freaking out. It was all he wanted to ever talk about. The star now laughing off the cannibal accusations. That's hilarious. Like, people called me a cannibal and everyone believed them. Hammer has denied allegations of rape and physical abuse, but acknowledged power imbalances in some of his relationships and being emotionally abusive. Now he says he's sober after struggling with drug and alcohol abuse. And despite living through what he calls an ego death, he says he's grateful for all he's gone through. Whatever it was that people said, whatever it was that happened, I'm now at a place in my life where I'm grateful for every single bit of it. As for his next steps, Hammer says he has co-written a screenplay and he's hoping to turn that project into a film.
