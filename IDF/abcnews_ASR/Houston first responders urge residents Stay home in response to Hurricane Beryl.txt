 Welcome back. We are following her. King Barrel as it moves across Texas. I want to bring in Houston firefighter and public information officer Marty Boos. I'm already I know you're busy. So thanks for coming on. I just kind of wanted to check in here. The Harris County Sheriff's Office is already reporting at least one death after a tree fell in a house. As a first responder, what are your biggest concerns right now? Our biggest concerns right now is just ensuring that the public is safe, that they're staying home. There if you don't have to go to work, if you don't have to travel on the roadways, we really encourage you to stay home. The storm is moving through really fast. So the best and the safest place for you is home, not on the roadways. We're seeing a lot of debris, a lot of high winds. And so the roads are just a dangerous place for the public right now. And right now at least 1.8 million customers are without electricity. What's being done to restore power and what's your advice to people when it comes to down power lines? There are significant power outages across the city. Our suggestions for Houston Fire, you can call 911 if you see down power lines, all down power lines should be assumed that they are charged, that they are live. So don't ever try to approach a down power line. Make sure that you steer clear of the area and you can report it to 311 or you can call center point. They have a telephone number that you can call and they will assist you with that information. And Marty, this is the first hurricane to hit the state in three years. What do you think the area will need most over the next few days? I think the biggest thing is going to be debris cleanup. Once the storm moves through restoring power to those individuals and as I stated debris cleanup. All right, Houston Firefighter Public Information Officer Marty Boosmardi, thank you. Good luck. Thank you.
