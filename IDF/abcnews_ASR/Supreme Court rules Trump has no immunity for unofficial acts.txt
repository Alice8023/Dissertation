 It's worth going back to some of these oral arguments in April because we, to a degree, saw some of this coming with the justices already suggesting presidents need some immunity. So how does this now play out going forward? Well, this is a, in no short sense, with a big win for Donald Trump. It means delay. We already knew that a trial on these charges would be unlikely before the presidential election. Now it's all but impossible based on today's decision. And I'd want to just quote for you. It's from the dissent here. This is a Supreme Court that is sharply divided on this issue along ideological lines. This was a six to three decision, the conservatives issuing that decision that Terry just outlined. The libbles in this case, dissenting very, very sharply in stark language. In fact, just as Sonia Sotomayor said today that the court gives Donald Trump all the immunity that he asked for and more. She accuses the court of an a textual, a historical, and unjustifiable immunity test that, in her view, puts the president above the law. So as much as many court observers had hoped that this court would somehow try to find a decision that would unify their bench in the country, they did not do that here. And this is a sharply divided opinion.
