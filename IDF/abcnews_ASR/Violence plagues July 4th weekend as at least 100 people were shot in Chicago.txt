 This morning, the search for answers after a violent and deadly holiday weekend in Chicago. At least 100 people were shot with three mass shootings reported. In all, 17 people were killed. Among them, Capri Edwards and her aunt, Nikisha Strong, killed when police say armed men targeted Strong's home on the south side. It appears that this started from some type of personal dispute. Police say Edwards died protecting her one-year-old son. Two of her other kids were shot. Strong's son was also killed. I would never in my life in a million years would think that I would see my mom laying down the way she was. This year, even worse than last July 4th, which saw 73 people shot and 11 lives lost. Locals say gangs are to blame, but they aren't the same as they used to be. Now, they're running in smaller, more violent groups. Some local neighborhood watch members saying a gang can be a block of people who don't like another block of people, adding that tons on social media often lead to attacks. We had to work together to stop this. We can't break, you know, fall apart. As for that shooting on the south side, no arrests were reported.
