 This morning get ready for prime day. Amazon's annual deal event. Oh, prime day is July 16th and the 17th. Amazon has revealed its prime day travel deals page, focusing on vacation deals, car rentals, including up to 30% off Avis, and saving up to 40% on Carnival Cruises. These travel deals are sort of an extra that they can offer their members. Prime members can gain access to those deals starting now more than two weeks before prime day. And Amazon is not the only one offering destination discounts. Walmart is extending offers on their sites for members too, including discounts on fuel and travel and 20% back in Walmart cash for booking through their portal. The ability to save on travel is exciting, but it's not necessarily the most lucrative benefit in these membership programs. You have to take the value of membership us a whole rather than just joining to save on travel. Wholesale retailers like Costco and Sam's Club also offer travel deals through their membership programs.
