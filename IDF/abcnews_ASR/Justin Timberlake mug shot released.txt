 Pop superstar Justin Timberlake, who, while in the midst of a lengthy US tour, was arrested for driving while intoxicated in the Hamptons. This newly released mugshot of the Pop superstar shows him after he was pulled over by SAG Harbor Police Monday night. Although he say that he drove through a stop sign and swirved into a lane of oncoming traffic, he was placed under arrest, held overnight, DailyMail.com, posting this video photograph of Timberlake and handcuffs. He's arriving at court this morning in that picture. He was arraigned and then released. ABC News Senior Investigator, of course, Bonnet, Aaron Katerzky has the details. Cana Justin Timberlake was pulled over in SAG Harbor a little after midnight. After police said his BMW 2025 model year blew through a stop sign and swirved into an oncoming lane of traffic. Police said once they pulled Timberlake over, they noticed he was on steady on his feet, smelled alcohol on his breath. He didn't do well on field sobriety tests. He refused. Police said to take a breather-lizer test and he was eventually booked on misdemeanor DWI charges. Timberlake was held overnight and appeared briefly in court before a village judge who ordered him released on his own reconnaissance. He was spotted by photographers leaving village court. And then he is due to appear before the same judge virtually back on July 26th. Then the case will somehow be resolved, we expect by then. He made no statements, neither did his attorney at Burke and no additional comment from the police. Cana? All right, Aaron Katerzky. Our thanks to you is always
