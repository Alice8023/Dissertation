 Federal prosecutors in Southern California have announced a historic bust, charging 24 suspects in connection with an alleged money laundering scheme between Mexico's Cinaloa drug cartel and Chinese brokers, while seizing millions of dollars in drugs, including 300 pounds of cocaine. We're here today to announce criminal charges against a partnership. A partnership between a cartel in Mexico and a money laundering organization based with Chinese nationals. Prosecutors claim the cartel has been using Chinese money laundering to hide more than $50 million, alleging they converted proceeds from the sale of illegal drugs in the US into Chinese currency. The cartel allegedly then used the Chinese currency to import goods from China back to Mexico. Among those goods, precursor chemicals to make more drugs, including fentanyl and meth. Millions and millions of dollars are moved in proceeds from the drug sales in the United States back down Mexico. And wealthy Chinese nationals in this country are given access to virtually limitless supplies of cash. These charges come as Chinese migrants face more scrutiny. Ecuador has now suspended visa-free travel for Chinese citizens, blaming a worrying increase in migratory flows from China. Officials say the South American country has become a key transit point for thousands of Chinese migrants headed to the US Southern border. And back to those drug and money laundering arrests, US officials say law enforcement in both Mexico and China helped arrest some of the suspects who had fled the US.
