 This morning, the pastor of a Texas mega church has resigned. A mid allegations. He sexually abused a girl for years, beginning when she was 12. It's just happens to be God's time, I think, for it to come to light. Cindy Clemashire, appearing on CNN, accuses gateway church pastor Robert Morris of molesting her between 1982 and 1987, when Morris was a traveling pastor. Clemashire went public. Morris acknowledged he was involved in inappropriate sexual behavior with a young lady, not referencing the girl's age, saying it was kissing and petting, adding it was wrong. Morris says he returned to the church in 1989 after two years of counseling, claiming he resumed preaching with the blessing of Clemashire's family, which she denies. He didn't come forward and confess. He was turned in. And when someone's turned in, what are they sorry for? They're sorry because they got caught or are they truly repentant of what they did? Morris founded gateway church in South Lake Texas, attracting 100,000 congregates across numerous locations. In this 2014 video, he spoke about his past, quote, immorality. I looked for girls that did not have a good relationship with their father. I learned to spot that. I looked for girls that were insecure. At first, the church stood by Morris, saying he shared publicly from the pulpit the proper biblical steps he took in this lengthy restoration process. But the board has now released a new statement after accepting his resignation, saying it did not have all the facts of the inappropriate relationship between Morris and the victim. No criminal charges have been filed and experts say the statute of limitations has likely expired.
