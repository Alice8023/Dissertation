Hey there, so there's been a lot of discussion about the theoretical risk of a human outbreak of bird flu, including from a former CDC director. But right now the CDC says the health strategy is a situation that has been touted out by the CDC's laws of peacefulspotment issues points closer to uncertain events posesей exploration allergic turkey this broadcast poses naturally bird flu it. It's to birds nearly a one hundred million poultry up affected across the country. But this is impacting cows there's been a hundred one dairy herds affected in 12 different states michigan Minnesota iowa or the hotspot right now. But there are concerns that the number could be far higher to Department of Agriculture reports, zero farms but you can count the number of positive cases on one hand, three farm workers who likely got it from the cattle that they worked with. Now, all of them had mild symptoms and recovered, and they didn't appear to spread the virus to other people. That's very good news. It's one reason why the CDC says the current risk to the public is low. At this time, there is no evidence for a fluid spreading person to person, but as we know, viruses do mutate and evolve, and that is why experts stress, we need to keep a close eye on this. Stephanie? Definitely will. Thank you so much, Trevor.
