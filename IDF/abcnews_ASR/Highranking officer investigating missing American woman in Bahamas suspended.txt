 This morning police in the Bahamas have suspended a high ranking officer investigating the disappearance of a Chicago woman. The department only saying the suspension is because of a concerning voice note circulating on social media. Another officer will take over the investigation into Taylor Casey, who was last seen in the Bahamas for a yoga retreat on June 19th. Casey's mother believes her daughter is a victim of discrimination. I feel like my child had two strikes against her. When she went over there today, yoga retreat and one was that she's black. And the other is that she's transgender and that disturbs me. Earlier this week, police revealed new details on Casey's phone saying they found it in 50 feet of water and they were unable to get information from it. They also revealed Casey's passport is missing and dogs picked up on a scent from the yoga tent, but ultimately it didn't lead to anything. Police say surveillance video in the area provided no new information.
