 There's some developing news right now involving the court and abortion in Idaho, which is something we've been waiting for. What's the latest there? Yeah, one of the biggest cases of the term, Phil, that we're waiting for is whether or not Idaho, which bans abortions in all cases, except when the mother's life is at risk, has to allow the procedure if a woman's health is at risk. And we've just learned, thanks to reporting by Bloomberg News, that the court earlier today mistakenly posted what appeared to be an opinion deciding that case. Now we didn't see that opinion for ourselves. It was only up for a brief period of time, but the Supreme Court just a moment ago confirmed to me, Phil, that they did inadvertently upload a document to the court's website. But a spokeswoman tells me that the case has not been released. And then it will be released in due course. We do know that the court can change its opinions up to the moment of release. We don't know whether what was posted was in fact the final opinion, but certainly for a court that has been embroiled in controversy, the leak a few years ago of the abortion decision in the DOBS case for this sort of misstep here, confirmed misstep. Now to happen again, it's certainly something, but we know that that's one of the big ones will be waiting for either tomorrow or Friday, Phil. It's almost unbelievable. This is one of the most... It really is. The wildest terms I've seen at the court. Devin, thank you so much for clearing all that up for us. I appreciate it.
