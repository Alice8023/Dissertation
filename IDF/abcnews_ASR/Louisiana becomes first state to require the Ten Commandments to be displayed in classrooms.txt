 This morning, Louisiana has become the first state to require the 10 commandments be displayed in public classrooms from kindergarten to publicly funded universities. If you want to respect the rule of law, you got to start from the original law given, which was Moses. Governor Jeff Landry signing the bill, which requires a poster-sized display or frame document of the 10 commandments to be installed by January. Landry says the law isn't just for religious reasons, but also for, quote, common cultural heritage. Now, hope and I pray that Louisiana is the first state to allow moral code to be placed back in the classrooms. Critics argue the law violates the separation of church and state. We learned the 10 commandments. We went to the Sunday school, and as I said on the Senate floor, if you want your kids to learn the 10 commandments, you can take them to church. The ACLU plans to sue, arguing this law will make kids of different religious beliefs feel unsafe, saying politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools. Under the law, the state funds won't be used for the commandment displays they'll be paid for by donations. Similar bills have been proposed in other states, but ran into legal challenges. Decades ago, the Supreme Court struck down a similar law in Kentucky, but now, if challenged, this Louisiana law will go before a more conservative Supreme Court.
