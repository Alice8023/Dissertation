 The family of a Chicago woman missing in the Bahamas is now pleading for more support from the U.S. government. 41-year-old Taylor Casey was last seen June 19th while attending a yoga retreat on Paradise Island. A young lady called me and said, have you heard from Taylor? I'm looking at the phone because I know she was from the yoga street and then she said Taylor hasn't showed up. But yoga classes. Casey's mother traveled to the retreat last week and now says her visit was deeply unsettling. She says she had to beg to talk to students at the retreat and says it felt like the students were told what to say and what not to say. And Seymour says she saw no missing persons posters. Despite authorities saying they've spoken to a number of people and deployed drones, divers and a canine unit, Seymour says I felt like the police did the bare minimum. Without U.S. government support, we may never find out what happened to my Taylor. Police were able to find Casey's cell phone in the ocean last week, but the family says authorities refused to turn over the phone. We need to eat Taylor in our lives. We miss Taylor. We need to take her home. That's the bottom line. Please. And the family says Taylor would never just take off without telling them.
