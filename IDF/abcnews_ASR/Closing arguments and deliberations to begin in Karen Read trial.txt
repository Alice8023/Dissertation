 This morning closing arguments are set to begin in the trial of Karen Reed, the woman accused of killing her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe. Prosecutors argue after a night of drinking and fighting, January of 2022, Reed intentionally hit O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die in the snow in Canton, Massachusetts. During the trial, lawyers showed text messages revealing possible trouble in their relationship and played this police dash cam of Reed at the scene. She kept saying, this is all my fault. This is my fault. I did this. But the defense claims Reed is being framed in a police cover-up, saying O'Keefe was beaten and attacked by a dog inside the home of another Boston police officer. Reed spoke to our Matt Gutman before the trial. I think things went too far. It was late. There was alcohol involved, but they're all family. And there's there's many of them involved. On the stand yesterday, an independent expert cast out on prosecutors claims saying if O'Keefe had been hit by a vehicle, the injuries would have been more severe. It's not consistent with getting hit by the car and ending up where he did. We don't really have enough evidence in this case to determine what one specific event actually caused that injury. Reed has pled not guilty to second-degree murder. She faces life in prison if convicted. The case has divided the Canton community and social media. The biggest challenge that this jury has is there's not a lot of direct evidence. Evidence that specifically shows something. Has this state proven its burden that beyond a reasonable doubt, she absolutely hit the deceased officer with her vehicle? If the jury finds any reason, any little bit of doubt they cannot convict her. Each side will have one hour to make their closing arguments before jury deliberations begin.
