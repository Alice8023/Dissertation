 I think it's so important to listen to youth voices about foster care. Paris Hilton, emotional on Capitol Hill yesterday, drawing from her personal experiences to push for reform and residential treatment facilities for foster children. I was forced by medications and sexually abused by the staff. I was violently restrained and dragged down hallways, stripped naked and thrown into solitary confinement. The entrepreneur and pop culture star, claiming the so-called trouble teen industry often misleads families. My parents were completely deceived, lied to, and manipulated by this for-profit industry about the inhumane treatment I was experiencing. Hilton has been pushing for reform for years. First, releasing a documentary in 2020, then advocating for a bill of rights for teenagers in group care facilities, and joining lawmakers pushing for more oversight. It costs approximately $800 to $1,000 per day to place a foster youth in a facility, significantly more expensive than serving them in their own communities. What is more important? Protecting business profits or protecting foster youth lives. Now, Hilton pleading with House lawmakers to do more to protect at-risk youth. Why can't we, as a society, see that these kids are hurting? They need love and kindness, not beatings and restraints. As a mom, these stories break my heart. During your testimony, Hilton urged lawmakers to reauthorize funding for child welfare programs.
