 This morning, the FAA is investigating another mid-air scare involving passenger planes. Audio captured the confusion in the cockpit. Wait, who's clear to take off on QA? Watch, as a Delta plane was taking off from Syracuse, New York yesterday, at the same time an American Eagle flight was about to land. From the video's angle, it appears the planes came dangerously close. As a stunned police officer watches seemingly convinced the planes were about to collide. According to flight data, the planes were separated by 700 to a thousand feet vertically, but it's unclear how close they were horizontally. It comes after another mid-air scare involving a United Airlines plane. The head of the aircraft has been classified to your head. The helicopter may think that you lost the tire on the takeoff. A Boeing 757 lost a tire after taking off from Los Angeles. Passengers were told by the flight crew to brace before the plane landed safely in Denver. United has been under extensive supervision from the FAA after a number of maintenance issues this year. Back in March, a tire of another United flight fell off moments after takeoff from San Francisco. The wheel crashing down in a parking lot, damaging these cars. Back to that incident in Syracuse, it was not immediately classified as a close call, but investigators are now taking a closer look.
