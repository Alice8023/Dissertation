 We are following developing news right now. Law enforcement officials tell ABC News pop star Justin Timberlake was arrested overnight for driving while intoxicated in the Hamptons. SAG Harbor Village Police say the Grammy winner blew a stop sign and swirled into oncoming traffic after midnight. Let's bring in senior investigative correspondent Eric Kuttersky for more. Aaron, what is the latest on this? Justin Timberlake was out for the evening. I guess on Monday night in SAG Harbor in the village of SAG Harbor right on the water beautiful spot in the Hamptons and he left wherever he was at about 1230 in the morning, got into a 2025 model BMW. According to police, he blew through a stop sign and apparently swirled into a lane of oncoming traffic. The official term by police as he failed to maintain his lane of travel. Police saw all this. They said they pulled him over and when they did pull him over, they said Timberlake was operating his vehicle in an intoxicated condition. So what happens next? We know he's in police custody. What's next? He was held overnight in police custody. He was arraigned in court this morning on the DWI charge and he was released on his own reconnaissance. At some point, he'll have a return date and probably the case will end up going away without much more. But he does have a local attorney who is known to handle these sorts of things and in all likelihood, this will pass for Justin Timberlake. But he does have a couple of shows that he's performing. So this is a little bit of a mark as he gets ready for that. We'll see what happens. Aaron Cudersky-Voros, thank you so much. Thanks for those details.
