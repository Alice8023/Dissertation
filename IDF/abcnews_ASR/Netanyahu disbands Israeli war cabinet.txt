 We have breaking news. Israel says Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has disbanded his war cabinet. Israel created the war cabinet days after the October 7th Hamas attack. According to a spokesperson Netanyahu says there was no longer a need for an extra branch of government. He says he's now letting his security cabinet make decisions about the war. The move comes as the Israeli military is announcing a daytime tactical pause in some fighting to let more humanitarian aid into Gaza. More in Correspondent Tom Sufi Burj joins me now from Jerusalem from war on this. Tom Housen is at the Netanyahu has now disbanded his war cabinet. And what does it mean for the trajectory of the war? I think it's significant it reflects the fractured nature of Israeli politics right now, Diane. Look, the war cabinet was set up after October 7th. It was a symbol of the unity government here. You had liberals coming in. You had former IDF chiefs. They a week ago stepped out of that war cabinet. In the last few days you've had more, well, the far right members of Netanyahu's coalition government saying they should be in the war cabinet. And in the end, you have Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, saying actually we don't need a war cabinet anymore. We'll go back to the security cabinet. A more traditional, larger body for decision making. I think it shows the divisions. There are, shows the pressures that Netanyahu is under both from the far right and from more moderate liberal elements in Israeli politics. A spokesman for the IDF telling us this morning that it won't impact the chain of command of decisions. Tom Sufi Burj and Jerusalem, thank you.
