 This morning a man who was stranded in Northern California mountains for 10 days is talking about how he survived. I'm sore, a little tired, I lost my voice. 34 year old Luke McClish shut out for a hike on June 11th in the Santa Cruz Mountains where he says he got lost. McClish was declared missing five days later on Father's Day when he didn't show up for a dinner. Rescueers finally found him last Thursday. I left with just a pair of my pants and my pair of hiking shoes and tea and that hat. I had a flashlight and a pair of folding scissors like a leatherment tool and that was about it. The Sheriff's Office says they deployed drones in a team from California State Parks including rescue dogs. During the search witnesses reported hearing someone yelling for help leading officials to McClish who says he lost 30 pounds over the 10 days. I would just make sure that I drank at least a gallon of water every day. But then after like getting close to the end of it, I was just my body needed food. He and his family expressed gratitude for all the first responders leading the rescue effort, but hiking might be out of the cards for the next few months. I didn't know hiking for probably the whole rest of the year need to. We've all hiked a lot. And McClish says that he became lost in the mountains partially due to the destruction of local landmarks in recent wildfires.
