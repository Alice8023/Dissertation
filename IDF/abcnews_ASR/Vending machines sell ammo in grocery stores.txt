 This morning, a controversial vending machine company is in the line of fire. A grocery store in Tuscaloosa, Alabama is the first to remove a kiosk that sells ammunition. As the city council considered the vending machines' legality. I got to cause about ammunition being sold in grocery stores. The vending machines. Is that, I mean, I checked it. I thought it was a lot. I thought it was a joke. The vending machine is made by American rounds, which says it uses artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology to match buyers of the ammo with their ID cards. The company says the novel way of selling ammo for shotguns, pistols and rifles will reduce theft and increase safety. Writing on its website, all transactions comply with federal and local regulations, maintaining the highest standards of responsible sales. It says six kiosks have now been installed in stores in Alabama and Oklahoma, and it plans to expand throughout the south. We're really excited about where we're going. We are going to continue to expand here in Alabama. We have a machine slated to go into Oklahoma, Louisiana, Texas. A manager at the Tuscaloosa store that removed the machine says it was not because of the city council meeting, but because of a lack of sales. The city has since verified that the vending machines are legal. And while many are enthusiastic about the kiosks, critics are taking aim online, one writing, deeply dystopian. Another quipping? What could go wrong? Users of the vending machine must be over 21.
