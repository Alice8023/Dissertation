 Meanwhile, the FBI has launched a criminal investigation into 23 Chinese swimmers for doping. The swimmers tested positive for a ban substance in 2021, but were allowed to continue competing, including at the Tokyo Olympics. Now 11 of those athletes are set to compete at the Paris Olympics in just three weeks. ABC's Andrew Dimbert has the details. Swimming's international governing body confirms the FBI has launched an investigation into the Chinese swimmers who failed doping tests, but were allowed to continue competing. Some of them are now headed to the summer games in Paris this month. The controversy began just weeks before the Tokyo Games in 2021, when nearly two dozen Chinese swimmers tested positive for a ban substance. Chinese authorities blamed food contamination at their hotel. The world's anti-doping agency did not challenge that explanation and allowed the athletes to compete. They went on to win three gold medals in Tokyo. That decision by the anti-doping agency was not disclosed until April of this year, and since then, U.S. lawmakers have pushed the Justice Department to investigate the case under a federal law that allows investigations into suspected doping conspiracies, even those outside the U.S. Congressional hearing last month, Michael Phelps and other Olympians criticized the world anti-doping agency for inconsistently enforcing the rules. As athletes, our faith can no longer be blindly placed in the world of anti-doping agency. An organization that continues to prove that it is either incapable or unwilling to enforce its policies consistently around the world. Phelps saying if athletes aren't held accountable, the Olympics will lose credibility. I think that's why we're here today trying to fight for that change for the next generation. Andro Dimbert, thank you.
