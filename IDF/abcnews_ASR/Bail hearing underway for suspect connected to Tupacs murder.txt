 And in Nevada, Judge is set to decide whether the suspect connected to the murder of rapper Tupac Shakur will be released on bail. Dwayne Keefe-D Davis had to be approved. Had been ordered rather to prove that he obtained the $750,000 bond legally before he can be released nine months after his arrest. A.B. News Legal contributor and partner at the Cochran firm, Sean Alloyd, is here with more on that. Sean, a Davis' team had refused to disclose where they were originally planning to get this money. They say he's enlisted a bail's bonds company. So where does this stand now? So really, it's just about the judge being sure that there are no illegal funds being used to secure this bond. Once they can show that it was legally gotten, then that will go towards the judge for consideration. Now, if he makes this payment today, what happens next? If he's able to make the payment, then he's going to be released on a house arrest. Remember, the judge still has the ability to impose pretrial limitations. He can be on electronic monitoring or other things that the judge feels is necessary to ensure that he complies with all future court dates. A prosecutor's charge, Davis, with murder, even though they don't believe he was the person who pulled the trigger. He has maintained his innocence in court. So what are you watching for us? This trial is set to begin in November. What we're looking for, really, Diane, is what direct evidence do they have linking him to this? A lot of what it seems right now seems to be statements that he's given to the press or within his book. But there is artistic license. So what direct evidence can they show linking him to this crime is going to be very vital for us and for the jury. All right, John Alloy. Thank you.
