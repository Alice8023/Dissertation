 Lord Stanley's Cup is headed to South Florida where it never freezes I mean it gets close to it, but the Florida Panthers edged out the Edmonton Oilers in game seven for their first ever Stanley Cup And not without historic drama The Panthers won the first three games of the series Edmonton came back to win the next three But a second period goal proved to be the winner and prevented the Panthers from being the first team since 1942 to lose the cup After winning the first three games that would have not been good With me now from I guess we'll call it the Islas South Florida. I live down there for a while WPLG reporter Roy Ramos joins us now Roy When you think of Florida, you don't necessarily think of hockey. So how is the sunshine state celebrating right now? And who would have thought we had this many fans out here? You know I arrived out here just off of Lasola and A1A to see a number of fans really Revealing in this celebration with the players of the Florida Panthers those Florida Panthers now Enjoying their 2024 Stanley Cup win I could tell you that they were celebrating right here at Elbow Room They started early this morning at around eight this morning and the fans out here really had a rare opportunity to interact With the cup some of them getting a chance to touch that cup others actually drinking beer from it Some of them having beer poured on them from it and then this a first I've never seen this before maybe you have but we saw the Stanley Cup then walked along the beach and put into the Atlantic Ocean I don't think I've ever seen that in my entire Career covering sports here, but you can see the fans are obviously very excited with this win This of course as the celebrations continue across South Florida Phil. Yeah, that's got to be a first so South Florida Hey, tell me about this the the emotional ups and downs of this series my goodness if that had been the biggest chokes since the 40s That would not have been a good thing for South Florida You know one of the phrases that was getting thrown around was cardiac cats and that's because The Panthers really gave fans a little bit of a heart attack there as the series was tied three to three A many of them not losing faith though knowing that the Florida Panthers the cats here would be able to pull through with a win They pulled through the win and then we have a decent amount of day drinking going on down there Roy Ramos Thanks so much for the report. We appreciate it and congratulations to everybody behind you
