 You can hear my voice right now. Two months ago I couldn't talk. A Massachusetts man now has his voice back after a rare surgery. Marty Keedian is the first ever cancer patient to undergo a total layering transplant. I want people to know this can be done and it's a process, but it's worth it. The 59 year old was part of a study aimed at opening the life changing operation to more patients. I don't matter what Gina, I'm getting my voice back. While the organ may be known as the voice box, it's also vital for breathing and swallowing, but some doctors do not embrace the surgery because people can survive without a layering. And organ transplants can be risky. Others disagree arguing the quality of life improvements are vital for overall health. Patients become very reclusive and very kind of walled off from the rest of the world. Patients tell me, yeah, I may be alive, but I'm not really living. Keedian is making progress with his new larynx, talking and adjusting to new foods as doctors prepare to remove his breathing tube. But eating and breathing more normally are only some of the benefits he now enjoys. For the first time, sense of surgery. I can talk to my 82 year old mother. He can talk to his mom again. Only two other people in the US have had this surgery. Those cases were due to injury, not to cancer and researchers hope to make transplants like this more accessible.
