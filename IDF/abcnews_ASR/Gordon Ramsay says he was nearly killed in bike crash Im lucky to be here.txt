 Hi guys, this is Gordon Gordon Ramsey says he's lucky to be alive after a bike accident in Connecticut last week. The health kitchen star revealing this enormous bruise under his chef's coat. You know how much I love cycling and triathlons and Iron Man, etc. And this week unfortunately I had a really bad accident and it really shook me and I'll say I'm lucky to be here. Ramsey visibly shaken at times thank the doctors and nurses who cared for him. He posted a picture, suited up before the crash and a photo showing his mangled helmet after alongside a stern warning to his fans. Honestly you've got to wear helmet. I don't care how short the journey is. I don't care, you know, the fact that these helmets cost money but they're crucial. More than 1000 bicycleists died and crashes with motor vehicles in the US in 2022, a record high. In cities like New York, bike ridership is reaching historic levels. Some riders opting for speedier e-bikes which now make up 75% of all deadly bike crashes in the city. Even overseas cyclists are getting serious about safety. In the traditionally helmet-free Netherlands, the government is now urging citizens to protect their heads because of an increase in serious injuries. As for Gordon Ramsey, he did not elaborate on what led up to the crash.
