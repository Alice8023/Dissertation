 Israeli air strikes continue to rain down on Gaza video today showing the number of explosions near Gaza City families seem running from the blasts and the Palestinian Red Crescent says more than 30 people were wounded It comes as more anti Netanyahu protests are sweeping the country and that is where we find our chief national correspondent Matt Gutman Joining me now from Jerusalem Matt give us an idea of what's going on around you. I know it's loud Hey, pal There's a pretty massive police presence outside the prime minister's residence Benjamin It's a Nyao deeply unpopular among many Israelis right now and we've seen protests like this multiple times a week for 18 months in Israel and the tension is only rising. Give you a sense Of how many police are are here? You see this line of police right here hundreds of protesters behind them You can hear the drums down below their police with water cannon mounted police There's been some significant fighting uh, Fisticuffs in these protests So this is different from the hostage protests. These are people who say that Netanyahu's government led to the October 7 disaster And it needs to go right now Phil Yeah, it's not the first of these protests We've seen many of them Matt if you can hear me talk to me about this the latest on the ground in Gaza. What do we know about the Israeli air strikes the new ones Um Israel has been hitting Gaza it also has been hitting an area of Gaza City in the north called Shedja here And this has been a complex use of force We understand there was armor moving in there and military sources are telling me that Israel was seeking Some sort of Hamas leader, although not see war himself yet. You see war the leader of Hamas multiple casualties Red crescent saying that they take it in dozens of casualties people wounded the death toll at this point and that particular strike is unclear But this is all happening Phil as Israel is talking about phasing down the intensive part in the war And even though there are still casualties in raids like this I think overall the daily death toll in Gaza is measurably less than it has been in recent weeks and certainly recent months Phil Yeah, and Matt and then there's this Israel's defense minister you all Galant issued a stern warning to Hasbola to the north and Milton group the controls most of Lebanon. How serious of a threat is a full scale Israeli invasion there At just moments ago Phil His fellow which is that powerful Iranian back militia that it almost controls Lebanon firing 40 rockets into Israel 20 intercepted There's been this War of attrition between Israel and the north of its order and his Bella for eight months now And on the one hand, Israeli officials like Galant and the prime minister of saying we can destroy Hisbola and Lebanon at a moment on the other hand just yesterday He said we really prefer the diplomatic option. We want Amos Hosteen who is One of President Biden's advisors who's been doing shadow diplomacy in the region to come through with a deal that he's been working on For eight months now that would move his Bala away from the border bring Lebanese military the actual Lebanese military To the border and grant some territorial concessions between Israel and hisbola on the border And that's something that everybody can live with But that ceasefire is dependent filled on the Israel ceasefire with Hamas and Gaza and that right now is not really in sight Phil Matt government reporting for us from inside Jerusalem Matt. Thank you
