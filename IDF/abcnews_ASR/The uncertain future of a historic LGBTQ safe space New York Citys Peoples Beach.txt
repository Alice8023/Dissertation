 We're sitting in what people like to call the gay beach, the LG BT communities beach to peoples beach when I was a runner-way when I had no community at all I came and I witnessed something that I never even knew it this that was a sense of family The first time I came to Reis Beach was 20 years ago I moved here from Florida and I came to New York to be gay basically I had no idea New York City was even on the beach A friend said, hey, like let's go to the gay beach It was absolutely fabulous The beach is just a huge part of like who I am, what I love And when I moved to New York, started understanding my queerness, started understanding my transness And it felt like maybe I wouldn't be able to go and feel safe at the beach again I got out here and like immediately could see just other like visibly trans people People who didn't seem to care how their gender was being perceived Regardless of our gender, our ethnicity, the ability to relax with friends, the ability to have a good life In many ways it celebrates what New York is all up out This is considered our mecca, this is our fire island, our hand thins, our vocal ruts on This is the place we can celebrate So we need to fight for this piece of land, we need to fight for that piece of land Jacob Reis Beach, Pier 1 and 2 has always been our home There have been artists, poets, performers and community here for decades This predates this you know, supposed queer liberation of June 1969 Like this has been a space of joy and liberation long before then Once a years ago I started a Reis Beach Instagram account Because I wanted to show Reis through the decades When I found out the beach had been a gay beach since the 1940s I immediately wanted to see what that looked like In the 50s and 60s, men used to sit on their railings and get ticketed for their shorts being too short And they were basically trying to kind of keep the gay visual further away at that time I think that continues today when there's this hyper focus on how we're like loud or unruly or sexual And if you go to like, I'm from South Jersey, people are doing unspeakable things on the beach And that's true for so many beaches, right? So the complaints have been we are nude, we are naked, we are nude, we are facetious And the reality is we are people just like their people We're so used to seeing signs from parks that are like, don't do this, don't do that, you can't do that It was really showing up last summer when there was a lot of increased policing In response to that, I really wanted to uplift what we can do And really remind people that we are allowed to be here Right here, used to be the Deposit Beach Hospital, which was opened in 1915 So if we're imagining that there's like this hulking building here, right? It's blocking people's ability to see onto the beach, it's also creating just a sense of identity for the place People felt safe, they were behind the walls Outsiders, people not from this community, wouldn't necessarily be gawking from the outside And now it's open to the world And then we're seeing just like the things that make Reese Reese just get literally demolished You know, the sand has been pulled away by erosion, which is all the result of uneven development Literal beach is shrinking, the building that really defined the space and held the space is gone We're walking toward the Jacob Reese Park Bat House It is on the National Registry of Historic Places as part of the Jacob Reese Park Historic District In this area, we're dealing with gentrification once again, but now on the beach That bathhouse, that historical bathhouse, that historical place that's been here for years It's about to be turned into a hotel to serve hulks, to serve wet community That's gentrification at its best In all of the renovation development of this space, there's not a consideration for how it might affect Curious of the beach or like social issues of the beach in general? I think for me, the problem really becomes about the uneven development We're talking about a working class queer beach It's not gonna line up Oh gosh, I can't imagine a New York City without a Reese Beach It is incredibly vital for a city of this scale And for any city to have an outdoor space where people can gather, especially for queer people to gather In the sun, outside It's queer to take care of each other Some of us come from families that our parents said, oh, you're like this? I'm not taking care of you anymore And so it's built into this community that we know that like we take care of each other We are each other's family And we need to think about health and wellness What therapy would look like for a lot of community members in this space I would like to use repurpose stuff to create a health and wellness center in that nabons of spot Something up off the ground that's gonna be protected The idea came because of the LGBTQ community here at the beach That maybe we could put together a community land trust Purchase the land from the city of New York and begin to develop both a community center As well as services appropriate to the beach People need to feel that they have some self-determination in a place where they can go and celebrate community And develop the rules that they feel are appropriate to govern both their actions and the use of the land We've had to create our own, our own safety around wheelchairs So the map that you see down here, community did that Community raised the money to get an accessibility map and wheelchairs That's community taking care of community It would be great if we could build more of this infrastructure to the beach My hope is that it's not at the cost of it being an accessible beach financially to the people that go there The importance of race also reflects the scarcity of safe places and the scarcity of like specifically course spaces I would love for this beach to feel less necessary I would love for this beach to feel less important But that would require that we felt safe everywhere So this fight is bigger than just me It's bigger than just us It's about us fighting for our space in New York City Stonewall is not here The city of that little triangle park can't hold 20 trans women Black trans, big trans women But this space can hold us all Thanks for watching
