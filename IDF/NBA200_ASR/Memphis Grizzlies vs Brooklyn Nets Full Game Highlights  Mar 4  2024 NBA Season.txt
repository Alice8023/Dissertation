 This game is underway as the net start action tonight. Two games out of that final play in spot after sweeping the little two games set with Atlanta. Rich is a three-year-old. Take it up where he left off. Take care of your business. It's first mentality and that's a great start. The grid is for three. Speaking of sweet strokes from three, Luke and Arn, Levy and B.A. I'm just looking to run. William is real cold. And knock it down. Three threes from the Grizzlies in the early season. Putting down the deck. Rubbling inside, throwing it away. William's a very impressive defender. Comes up with a seal. Hal Dama bakes the rid of dribble. Cunard. Cun X. And Kevin Oli wants to time out. I know. You're trying to get him to help you possibly. I know we as fans, particularly net fans, we want him back from the court. Camus in screen. And a turnover. Nice job defensively there for Brooklyn. And he's spin-fliped alone. Knocks down the three. Here's William's off Sal Dama. Off Sal Dama off one play. A good bait for him. A good tribute from Deep. A picked it up last game. A continuing here today. Finity Steve. A union. I'm sick. We have good balance, let's be honest. Shooter. Cunny. Cunny. Cunny. Tectic basketball himself. The bar St. Shory is first for Brooklyn. Here's spin-fliped on a three. He got it. The 80-0 to 63-0 to quarter for Brooklyn. The radio. Gives it up. Pad three is good. Matt Hurd. Great, Jefferson. Matt Hurd. This is what's happened with the Grizzly. I think they were shooting. There's nothing wrong with it. You can shoot a different game, Shotbox. Steven. Getting out. Contrars three is good. They can along two for John Contrars. So you're hanging out with us on this Monday night? Here's Bridges. You're on a three. So you're all over the place. Already nine points for Nick West. The gun running for Memphis. Steven finds a seamen lays at home. They get to stop. They're getting out and running. They're pushing the pace. The Bates Quackston and Finish. Out to Jackson. His three is good. GG Jackson is 50. Ah, that night, but they were trying to steal, stay in the game and that's the same stuff. And you did. 51 as Bridges. Reversions have to look. Didn't say. Back to now in a crowd. Can't hook it in. Dept alive by Finney. Spin to Jackson. He's really loud. James. Oh my. James. Yeah, well, and then he says, Buck, he said, yeah. The Ravie. Ible. It's a finish. Look like he was in between. Definitely clears out space when he gets to good going on the. In the corner, that three is good for Walker. Williams trying to find a lot of. Races. Just a casual. Yeah, that was a little walking boy. Your shooter. Sipping inside. I'm spinning. From Danny. Shooter. Back to the game. This is cancer. Brooder. Johnson. He got it. He got it. Steven. Spinning in trap. The elevate. Drops it in. Steven said an ice game. Johnson. Attacking. Kicking. Extra feed. What's moving? Brooder. You did. Beautiful possession. Brooder. Get into the pain. And it finishes. It's back in front. Now the 13th second difference. David Schocklock. Steven's looking to use the sound. Brooder instead. Heroets are larger. You think coming out of the half against the Hawks. Game number two. They stepped their defense. They're going to be an in pass and lane. It kind of take control of this situation because right now. They feel good about what they're doing. They mean the Memphis Grizzly. You can answer that first. Brooder. Two man action with wax. Oh, I've been it all beautifully. Let's see the way they came. Johnson to the pain finish. He got it. And what's again. Johnson. Johnson shovels wax against the eyes. What a rejection from Jefferson. And on the other hand, Williams lays it in. Williams. Penal. Games. An art. An act. Gord and 53 consecutive regular teams. It doesn't even include all the playoff teams. An art again. That's it. More so than scoring. You need to take them out of what they like to do. Wilson. Hey, Johnny. Daniel and Wilson. Shooter-Law, man. Hey, look. Look now. One of four for deep. Memphis 11 for 28. Walker. Cut. On a three-year-old man, Johnny. Walker. Nearly at a taken away. He's sitting over the Wilson. And on a three-year-old man, he's sitting over the Wilson. Walker. Nearly at a taken away. He's sitting over the Wilson. And on a three-year-old man, it's a little bit. Instead of just allowing Memphis just to dribble the ball up, run into the clock, feeling comfortable, back door cut. Whoa. Memphis suggests. Not sharp. Get it out. Steve it. Down the ball away. It's a great shot, but that's the deep. Get into the paint a little bit. I like it. Get them on the move. Get them to there. That's how you create an open shot. And we've seen when we get penetrated. 13 now for Walker. He's three of five from deep. Bridges the steel. Here comes Smith. A little bit of length. Blackston. Sharp. Get you extra possessions on the offensive glass. He has been aggressive. Deliver the blows when you're driving. You're allowed to hit them. Johnson has good. 16 points, but it will need him to have a big fourth quarter. Back to back. 20 point game for Johnson entering this one. As Stevens bustles his way in. What's the first barrel scene? Yes. And I like Blackston. Herk's three is off. Steve it's another offense of rebound and he puts it in. And what is happening? Shooter is down there. How does it happen? The yard is three to two. Spitting. Swimming. Swimming. Oh, man, hitting. Goodness. It's pounding. Shooter. Riches. Sharp. All get banged up. Six to shoot. Williams looking to get some space. Williams gets bumped. Oh, thanks, it ain't. No foul for the bucket. I'm getting... Deflections getting out. Getting easy buckets. Getting fouled. And of course they were hitting three point shots. So right now they have a very confident... Infancy is three is off. Another effort for Finney Smith. Riches another chance. That's what he's doing. It's an opportunity. Shooter. Dances. Pencash. Four points. Get up in. Shot clock down to three. Williams, gears in. And finishes with the fading shot clock. Huge bucket. Push in. Need a break. Shooter gives it off. Riches launches. And head foot was cow. And Memphis doesn't have a time out left to challenge. Outlet. Particularly have two bigs. Riches. This is an elite violation. On bridges. Riches had to hang tight. So just moving around. Moving around and creating open player. There it is. Here's Cennard up ahead. And that will do it. And incredibly disappointing loss for the Brooklyn Esk. At home against Memphis.
