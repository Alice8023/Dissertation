 You ready? You game? I'm game. Feels the tip. Everybody! Oh, oh, oh, oh, come on! You didn't like the second one? Oh! Come on! With that W as well. And in Eric Pass, that will come to hard. Not that it's easy, it was going to be there getting, trying to pick up pace. This is a penalty moment for shoulders and a scoop and score plus the foul. And that's the main primary weapon is being able to take that three-point shot and make it. Steak me to the three-point shot. If he's able to get the basketball persistently down there. Arabia, desperation shot fading away and he's going to get that friendly bounce. So I'm going to settle for the shot and it goes in. First points for Memphis. See that really struggles the score. There's a power move inside off the pass from Gidey. As Jinger. Once again, getting down low into that Memphis defense. Up top that shea off the catch. That way it's going. Right down the middle and the three are flying here early. How much of the grizzies right now in that native area? And there's a turn over. Three on one, Gidey behind the defense and he's able to slip it up and in. Is he himself? Always scoring team in the NBA. Turn seven points per game. J. Holes up, contestants. Got enough over the outstretched arm of Jackson. He knows where he wants to get to. You know, not just the playing of grizzies, but that they're playing their system and they're getting to those spots. Top shot fade away. That was nicely done by Stevens. Five first quarter-three. At 12 all of Friday night. So roll the drive. And... Is that something? You're going to have to manage. Is he a Joe? He wants him in the three-point mix and five. So bottom of the net. Just under three minutes to go. You've got 33 points on the board. And now the bounce back game for Joe. I guess by him. I don't know. And then from there, a flam. And it's the bottom of his inner socks here. My goodness. It continues here. Kason Wallace. Nice. That was a good spot here. J. Get on Stevens. Series of ball-fakes. Top shot of a big slide. But he shows the touch. He hits it with shot as he comes in the game. And the start to second quarter. That is off. Yet he fires at the table. And puts it down. He's not allowed the grizzatil. Let me set up in a pound. Deepest. Walker and off that wall. The wall is waiting for something to go. But if it runs for it, step back. Stevens, one point down the lane. It's up to James Zimney, some of the pass. And it's a net-fist. A lot of good job of packing all those dark-crowded jerseys. Hit the main. Oh, there's a beautiful pass here. And the Wagon set it up. He's tried. We're going to run him off the three-point line. And ready again. Eat stock block from Memphis. Trying to make his move. That's a tough shot. We've got Lou Dord's defending him on the perimeter. That's not that nice. This is my opponent. I want it now by J. Will. Lies up the tri-fectal. That's a beautiful play by him. It's a 12-to-10. On the glass. Oh, dama, little euro-step. And then the scoop and score. That was a nice move. This pass is a bit basketball right now. Jay wants to step back. Bring on. How does he do it? That was pretty. Drolls one from deep. Lord, he's stocked in the corner. Like a short nice rebound. And he goes up the dribbet. Dork. Just trailing the play. Kind of a casual career. He's still a very good officer. He's only shot. You know, without drop a ramp. And obviously having that play back there again. Not the smart thing. He's got the ball. What we saw a season ago when they led the NBA in points in the paper. Dead last this year. But they take the fifth most threes in the NBA. That's how they get their points. And there is Ted Hombra in game two points. How the third play the Thunder has been able to fall into a possession. See if this year will be four before they get a score. Oh, nice drive in kick. And once again, it's Ted Hombra in one. Well, the Thunder just would not let show up that play defensively. That's a nice take. Jared Jackson, Jr., Rugged Drive. Look at the third quarter start of play. J. Dubbid. It looked like the radio lost it on the way up. But Jackson, G.G. Jackson, look at that. Look at that. They're going to put it down. I mean, the guy sacrifices his body on night to night bases. Covered for his team against the hot truipus. The two see the thread of the needle. That contract got converted to a four-bear seed deal. It's looked good for Memphis so far, Gidey. This is a lot of three. Not going to miss that three in the corner. And they've been more aware of the shooters, which is what David Hawkellois talked about with Jared Blossom in the past time as well. Are you just keep flying behind the back and scoop over? Gidey, trying to chisel out some space there with Aldama up ahead. Jackson got behind everybody. He's going to be on Memphis Goose. S.E.A. is just doing the bus drive. He's taking everybody to the school. Shay, what's going on there? That is just impossible to defend. Just like, you know, how do you do it? Because everything looks different to me. This is tough. All right, we should take that time. I say a joke. Gidey up the counters because he's starting to see so many different defenses. He's at the top of the scouting pool. Lee Gorge should be at the top of the defensive scouting report. You know, the play that they had, you know, this is more than just a sample size. They've been playing some really good basketball all season long. A movement around the pieces on the chest pool. You're talking about eight to ten pieces at a time. No, rotation rise. Cadridge. Knocks giving a big space whatsoever. Going in Hayward. Going to send it up to Wiggins. And Wiggins is going to take it up. Throw it down right up the rack. There's a rare miss for G-Wil on target. Just short. Throw. Throw. Tash, initially, but a foul. I see it. Jill, the help defender did not want to give them. How about Josch, Gidey? What's his mission? 50th level. Double double of his career. But he did it in 19 minutes. He's quite a presser to that first half. He didn't even put the scores right there. So it tells you a lot. That's right. Who would pull if that certainly something? You want to continue to work on. That is a deep three. Ragan, no. And put that go by Jameson. This is all the issues. This is team back to back seasons with 50 wins. The team see a really well going. Anyway. This meant this team not going to want to have the same result. It's going to be interesting to see how that game goes. Nice and a head pass. Also, coming up this ball. Y'all have to have the goal board as well. And the thumb will continue. Very physical with them. But you know what? He gives it right back. And then what is so remarkable. More teams Michael. They've got SGA at the top of the Scouting. Forget it. They won't do it. Some of the great rebounders. Charles Barker is probably the taker. This is the subtle presence of Luccalo. They're going to throw off season's keybons. Maybe Jackson. Well, that's nice. We're talking so long, then. That's how he's got so well done. He's got 20 points off with them. I think the Grizzlies are a good time or impact next year. Maybe a completely different team than they are. This is a decent while. It's just continues to stroke it. He's 9 out of 30. The ninth consecutive victory for the Thunder in this building. They have the second best home right.
