 You ready? You game? I'm game. My bad was the time. With that defense, yeah, second time around. You beat him in January in Miami and that was a big, big victory for the Thunder. He's in the troll with tip. And Quattler, quickly ripping off the floor. Quattler, Quattler broke it up and in and those are our first points of the game. Like to play on both sides of the basketball. Oh, what a pass, Josh Stetty thread in the middle right in between two key players and that's how the Thunder get on the board and there was not a lot of space. There's a little back screen. About this and just a little screen in the road. On the shot. Come on, this. That's all I know of in the book. I'm going to call it set. Please. Brown Hawking. That's what happened at all season. This man was the best shot at all as SGA. Gams is off the Yolich. Left die Mike. He's a tough kid. He's taken a lot too. As advertised by Paris Lawson. Now it's Rose here with SGA. Always willing to pass when he sees the crowd there is a very far. He's been so good to the basketball from three. Just keep going up the floor of the game going. Can you see the feet contacts? A word off the catch. That three is good and go on and Hayward coming off of his best game yet. As Rose here that's put in. Knocked it away. Now Wallace on the land but Jalen Williams pinned it up on the backboard. Hayward gives it up by Zeyad Joe. Contestant hangs in the air long enough. SGA trying to make things a little uncomfortable. Get the ball up the floor. Here the string. Shot clock didn't reset. Hayward's going to have to find a teammate that's so SGA from downtown. And it'll beat the horn. As Butler in the game. Martin. That three is going straight away. Both these teams are good defensively. They shoot the three respectfully well as also. Where there is a Jimmy Butler special. He had the rookie Kason Wallace on him and his offense. This is such a good player over the course of his career. Wallace the drive. Nice step pass underneath. There's Josh Gettin in that dunker slot. He was camped out in the perfect place. Let her try to break down that defense. Nice pass. J. Williams. Rinsing in the eighth. Got to write my own power. He puts it in. Butler wants it in the post. Extra pass over the corner. Mills out of the sudden to win a row. And political achievements are women around the world. J. Duh-Hark take going right through the cup. Really did just 14 points. Dallas committed to get the ball out of his hands. Dangerous tactic. Mills came from the outside. He's got 11 points. Giddy was stripped on the way up. Now it's Butler on the move. Gives it right back Martin Martin. It was right at Chad Humbren. He was there just as he was turning. If he wasn't, that's a two-poss for them. J. Duh-Hark, out to J. Will. That's where he is. That's J. Outside Isaiah Joe. He's got some space in that three. Trap's in. It's SGA. When it comes to being around the rim, you have all the confidence in the world. That's just a nice find. Not a bio, another was six. J. Trap has been on Harkes. Nicely done. He's in the way. That is a tough shot. Not only people realize just how big Harkes is. It has been a rough shooting night from the outside. Butler. Leans. That's the position on SGA. Butler caught. Got the two-free throw from SGA. We can soon freeze defense. Right back to Butler. Butler. Extra pass. Roseears got a little space. Unports a three. Rejection. Nice pass inside. It's getting fine. Shabhendren. That's what that's prepared for. Thoughts are the top one. Pass outside. Up top Roseears. Robinson passed it up. Yolvid to the corner. And that's where he is going. So Miami is not missing its open look. He's the one defending Yolvid. He spins. All back up top. And Robinson's got himself a three. Let's try to split it out. J. spins. And it's going to get the friendly bounce. That one blocks in. God, well, excuse me. That feels like a little bit of a grind. There's another turn around. J. Doke's it up. Good. Six minutes in the third. Tight game. J. drives in. Is he going to get the balance? Is he going to get the foul? J. With six. Hudson. He's going to get the foul. J. With six. Hudson. Back outside. Can fire three. J. With a Williams. Yeah, that was going to block in. While it's almost turned it over. You've been dorked. J. With a fly by. Looking for the three and got the three. So Isaiah Joe, eight points off the bench. Butler. Spinning and scoring. Made the move on Gordon Hayward. A couple of veterans. He's 23. He's not pointing back at all. Look. Say once again, once again, a little bit more. Martin scores over the top of Martin. That goes he too. We've got a four quarter opening up. With a Wiggins, cast in three and Mills continues. His huge night, Patty Mills. Wiggins. As he takes an attack, scores at a Latine. Trusting up for the stay and to get it home. And the big jumbo tron did not decide the challenge. Clearly. Notice? Pushes it up it in. Borgren. And it grabbed the entire way. Pockets came over to Patty free. Butler. Trads. Strong. Follows. Yes. The solid game. 19 points against Portland. Backing up with 11 more tonight. And the night has shed. Haldron came over on the weak side, swatted away. Butler. But Haldron has dared to drill the three. Still the one point game. Early minutes of the fourth quarter. Haldron. Space. Unleases the three. He's not a bad shot by Jeff. Not a Josh. Just a quick strike. Butler. The speed. The dump. And Haldron. The Wiggins. What a drive. And what a finish. So remaining is detonating at the rim. And it gives it those shooters quickly. Jay. To the baseline. And life over Haldron. With the bucket. Joe. Thousands. Watch the bounce. The scope shot. No good. And we have a putt that caught it. Me here. Butler. A rhyme of scream for Robinson. In-track it. Outside the three on the way. And Miami is not going away. That is Rosir for downtown. That is a huge shot for the heat. Jay. Find it back. And it bounces in. Get it from the rim. Oh, that's a ripper. Back it's more jammed. Butler. The sidestep. Flooring the side for the whiteGO. You see tonight. Thanks to the front of defense. Mr. Point. with some big fish tonight for him. Shay already was eight, making 11 in the fourth quarter. Stick's another big shot. Those here. Shun off nicely by J. Will Robinson, the center by J. Doe, pass the hoist. D3 to beat the shot crack and Duncan Robinson does. That's the foul to do for Miami. Next foul is going to put the center of the free throw line, J. Doe, cutting through the lane. He somehow got it up right through the defense. J. Doe. There's an Oklahoma City comes back home to start off this homestand. Racing a 14-point second half deficit. And taking back. That's it for the first half. That's it for the first half. That's it for the first half. That's it for the first half. That's it for the first half. That's it for the first half. That's it for the first half. That's it for the first half. That's it for the first half.
