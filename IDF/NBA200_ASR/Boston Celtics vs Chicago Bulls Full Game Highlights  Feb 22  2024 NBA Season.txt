 Well, get one more. You ready? You game? I'm game. The number one three point shooting team in the lead. And I understand, you know, you got three so many of your better defenders. This is a very offensive minded game. But I say go with your big lineup. It was white. Was shaking. The slip, Ruchovich Ketch, Shukka. One of their best on ball defenders, Karuso Garts Tate. Holiday off the cross court pass. Now it's a down. That's what the bull's rotation has got to be quicker now. Brown, who had a nice all-star game in was nearly a four hundred point contest. Brown takes it out of scores. We're 36 for the East. He's the third option. Here's game for he's the number one option. But you can tell he's much more comfortable playing with this thing than you can see with that. Right, right, right. Ioway contested three through holiday trying to get out of him. Nearly got a fingertip on it. Iow still hits. He's having his best shooting season in 41 percent from three. And we're trying to beat him to a spot. Boots of itch. Nice shot by Boots of itch is third field goal. So that time he at least stepped up a little bit. Unlike the previous play that Stacy pointed out that being said that's what Porziggas can do. He's got a nice jump shot to switch the ball. Oh, man. But a smaller one. Oh, my goodness. Inside the Valentinian swan away. I say it's like the sixth boss I think right myself. It's Boston Relinquish. I think that's Brown. He's scores it. Six to shoot for Rose. Step and back. And traffic. He throws it is for a spunk. Every shot is going to be contested nine years. He's not going to get any. Fillers was behind the Horford screen of veterans savvy play by Al Horford. It's not a rebound. Those two with a sled Boots of itch. Spins. Look scores. I need to be good to play big. Yeah. Nice. We've been left in the way. It's what I got for two big. I got to get something. Those super one. There you go. You got that four on two break. You got to attack this team. You cannot let them get back and set up eventually. Drum and flashes. They get a two of against two first one dribble. Powerful. As a good strong move. Tatum is struggled to start the night. Here's holiday against Gosubu. Turn around jumper goes. I think true holiday could be like a really good ceiling for Iowa. Preachies. You wanted Horford out of there. Holiday doubled. One more pass. Gosubu. Gosubu. Three. Bang bang bang. You saw that actually you saw that play developed. Those fresh. Coruso trying to stick with holiday. Pritchard the house or on the fake extra feed. Pritchard the rainbow. Three. And you got Richard and has over there. But what? Pritchard 39 Bruce career. Coruso is looking for trucking. And drumming couldn't squeeze on that tough jump. Fresh housing holiday to house. He scores. Lucho minster rose in and no soup along with Carter. Tatum looking for. That thing about that play along. Yeah. With the sheet round the kick that left house are open. As you mentioned former Milwaukee buck. Here is Tatum the pearl the shot and the rainbow jumper goes down for his second field. Goal on six drives. You mentioned the loss of hominay has contributed all year to that for the late. The clock IOTO sumo finds Julian Phillips or three. They got a couple of guys that can really shoot it. I was made some really nice passes. Nice smooth from Janet Brown who's hit both of his three. He's got 15 points. You're really not going to be born the kind of thing where you're going to switch. You're slipping through the body of porzinga's white. Hootch of it. Extra feed. Don't sumo inside. White outside. Take back. Coruso. What a pass. White. Up through it. Break, break, break. What's your help? White trying to stay with Brown. Don't sumo came over to help. Now, white gets switched on to porzinga's. Hollen hits the three over butch image. White picks him up. Double from doso. That leaves Derek white. Open court throw. Someone's got a slide over. Team five lost into the first. It's Aedo to start the third for the Celtics. Derosit matched up with porzinga's with the little group of his game. One like it fade away. With the finals. Coruso challenges porzinga's with the left. Yeah, he did challenge him. Here's the rosin. Sweeps throw and scored. Oh, nice little up and under. On both the ends. I used that challenge Derek. White that time. They're a white, a very good shot blocker as a guard. Or a big apart dog. Derosit out. Roach of it. Tata nice spin. He's got seven in the quarter. The defense by drumming. Dosobu's on Tatum. He contestants. Tata. It's a throw. Dosobu drives it. Loads it back. Late at the clock. Phillips. A little out of control. Steps through. Oh, Julia Phillips. Rest of the piece called Wethers. Great Apollo Creed. Here is Tatum. Wethers. He's in the drumming. Poor Matt Stale for the recoil. Game tonight. Stacy pointed it out from the young. White's back in for the silver one. Hit the point. See what I'm talking about? Number six for drumming. With seven points in 12 minutes. Two minutes left in the third. Derosit. Drumming. Bang it away. Oh, I say too small. Good defense. The better offense. Separates and the better offense wins the day. That's why he's so important. Oh, back side. Nobody picked up. Luke Burnell is his second third. Duncan enough. 15 in the quarter. Don't be white. Get it off. Hand hits. White with H. Brown on Derosit. Run in the screen. Deros in the shot. Dropped in the put back. There he goes. On the best offense of rebounds. That's the best offense. Richard. He can shoot it. He wouldn't have held it. Those are cross court passes. Years of the lead. Richard. He hits again. You have a big time score. He's hit six threes three times this year. Derosit. Jumper again for the safe spot. They agreed on a new four-year deal for him. And he has paid dividends. So it was Derosit. White. Who's signed an extension as well. And the wide open. All four of his buckets on dunks. Oh no. Derosit. Girl.enden. See where Luz's Lanka point on. Sky corner! Dmitic his job. It's a lookしく ref聙 aaters anything for them. He doesn't tread anymore because their Buddy is back there. головin it is удom critical. Granite potential foul. підem burn off. Crowd beat leader likened. Round of correlation. He drives it. Five-square-trivich on the nice feet. Where's the first point in half of Uch? There it is. White out the Tatum. That's a bit of a second half for one of the great. Run in the perimeter, six to shoot, doubled. Cross-court, slow pass. That's how White saved it on the steal. Territor goes to the corner. That's when you have to have more. Even in years where offense is the way it is. You know, those teams always stick out on defense. The Carter team. The good defense are always having a chance to win. 11 blocks, 10 steals for Boston. One of the top defense teams in the NBA hold the bulls under League average.
