 You ready? You game? I'm game. My bad moves are tough. This is what players who maybe haven't gotten a lot of chance to play, get an opportunity to get extended minutes to show what they can do. Yeah, he was a heck of a player in college. And he's brought that competitive fire everywhere he's got coaching. Sterozen is last five against the jazz. There's Caruso still on the floor, Holly with the two fouls, coping white. A dynamic gun player, Caruso off the wing, hits the triple. Caruso headed for a moment. Two to bits, nearly step out of bounds, gives it away, since a bomb, but... Grandmaster, Grandmaster, Grand Cop in his cover, the rook. Dancers through traffic, talent, horse and Tucker on the floor. I call three, Parks and Strides in, passes out, college wide open. That's what I like about John Collins. Your seven is checked in for the first time, THT, out front, toes it for three. Up and in. Drunk Carter is one of the best defenders, I love his defense. Caruso took it away from TST, and pops the rim on the other end. Caruso foul trouble early, but he's dropped five on the jazz. Drunk hooked, baby, right in the paint. You know, throw him a pair of goggles, and it'll be just fine. Oh, Mara with a couple of buckets here in the second quarter. Chicago's dancers would drum and... Shoot over top of you. Over the top pass, Shamanets in the paint. Oh, beautiful, dash Collins! What a nasty putdown! Shamanets to Collins! John Collins looks inside as Shamanets back out to sex and Caruso chases. Beautiful slide, dancin' call. You know what I taught, Nasty? Eight rebounds, 13 points, and 18 minutes of play, done. To Collins, and I wanted to drag and scores. He's giving you what we need without a walker, Kessler in here. He knows he's got to be more defensive, more paint protected. There's a lot of three, three, three, Joe's hammers in this game, and cinzabon delivers. I felt that one up from up here. 19.6 to game, 20 here at Salt Lake City, done. Left to right, spins, wide open. The restricted area was all over. Setson, done, fires a strike, Luca, up and in. Oh, and with him. Collins, wide open, up and out. Caruso rebounds and clears. Give him space. Cannot give him space. 12 point game for Collins, 29 against the Wizards on Monday night. Easy tool on the big fellow reaches up and scores. Vitch of itch now with 15. There was some talk about maybe people were disappointed in the trade, and I just haven't seen it. I think it's consistent. He's been amazing. The sumo with a runner, his first scores, and his first quarter of seven can all. I'm juicing nice job of standing down under feet on the roads. It's perfect. Way on track. Vitch of itch shows the big man has range. Nearly pulled his dream. Shot clock down to 12. Good deepens by the jazz, the bounce is up and out. But the tap then. Vitch of itch is really great deepens up until that point. I've done a decent job of taking care of the ball. Only five turnovers. Sets and rips it. Probably the 16. Like you said, Oli Lo. To see Jordan Farbson line it up. Drummond. Oh, no. Nice rebound. Your seven shot clock resets a 14-coction trying to make a... Okay. Seven point gain. White. Peruso. Who's going to win this three-point battle? You're two bodies between the balls with the defender. Will be the last play 32 minutes tonight. The road's in 27. Drummond. Put his hands up, thought he was fouled. And THT just rips the rebound down. And here we go. Great, great deepens to the board that rim. Nice. Your seven. Got back. Drummond flat footed. Oh, Mayor with eight points. Five rebounds to reassess. Let's get the stuff. Derosen is down. Face first. Done. Three ball from the corner. Because of the block. We're not going to give him that. Derosen. Mid-range shot. Jucks it up and in. They're going to go to him eight lots. So Jeff have to figure out how to make the work for. Done. Spend it. That is just icing on the kick. Especially with everything else to get defensively. Jazz up, not missing shot here in the fourth quarter. Chris Dettel and down. Tuesday. Inside. Oh, yes. Just rolled it in. Smart play. By Jussie. And he knows a mid-range jumper. And he's not going to hold. Done. Now behind the three point line. Here's your seven. Three point line. Junker back. Roller. That's about 10-throwing. To give us some extended minutes. Gonna have an opportunity again like some of the guys. Derosen got the first quick step. And was not going to beat a nine. Takes on a triple team and just simply threw that ball away. Looking for Cluso who cuts a little deeper. John Collins on her runner. The jazz worked quickly on the inbound. And he got the bulls flat-footed. He went around Vuchavitch and just came up short with the right hand reach out. Derosen into the paint quickly. Drives and scores. Time out real hardy. JC double-pumps. Here's done. Drives gives it off the sex and steps to his right. But. Oh, great. Great verticality. He's been the first guy who could stop to mark Derosen right now. I love it, Chris Doug. Sense of all. Jump's up in it. The rebound on one end. The bucket on the other. And the rookie has his first career double-double. Collins trails into the right. He jumps into the rim. Must go. Jazz get the stop. They can tie or take the lead with a three. JC dribble drive. Space ball. He rocks it. He rocks it. He's got to go. Stop the goal. Give it out. Sucks in free away. Back. Well, I like that combination, Dolor. Rick of JC against Caruso Spinning. Balls down. Picked up. Sucks to hands it. Pick it away. He's not giving it up. Derosen runs over. Sense of all. We're going to call a block. The bucket. And a free throw. Caruso has to hurry. They do fine. Derosen. That's who they wanted. Clarkson and Sucks in collapses. And now we got some jaw on down on that bull's bitch. I don't know. Oh, just needs to rock away. What? Yeah, now John Pallazone. Back out. Back out. It escalated in a hurry. Chris Don has to be restrained on great drum and gut into the middle of it. We're going to get back to it. After a beauty altercation, I've been obsessed to Chicago's toy break for being an extra gator in the initial altercation. Followed by a technical foul on his sister. Chris Winnon. And a technical foul on Utah's John Pallazone. Anybody that was in the game for Utah at the time was sheeplocked Rick Gray. They will go back to the planning of Hudson and the hard erase of the wood. They will take to the middle of the bridge. 28 for the Rosen. Make it 29. We'll hardly the time out. I'll double advance the ball. This time done. We'll end now. I won't let any sign quickly, section one. Bounce to the wind. No. Tap, tap. you
