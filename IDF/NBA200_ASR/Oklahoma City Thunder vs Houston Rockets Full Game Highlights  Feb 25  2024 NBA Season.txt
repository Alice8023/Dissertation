 Welcome to the one. You ready? You game? I'm game. I'm game. My bad moves are tough. Who ain't you know it's so? That success does not necessarily mean future success, but Rockets did do a real good job against this country team. Not only the Finnegan, it's free of question. You're rushing them all to glass and that first matchup of the season misses after Cup. That's what Chip told you. Really good from day one. He is a credible shot blocker. That one goes down to the Thunder. Finally, a team is on the board of Luke Dorknox at down. But he did defend the rim at an elite level against the Rockets earlier this season. Shengun, up top three ball. Good game top. He's three point. I'm going to shot fake and go to the hole. He's got a beautiful shot face. He has twenty more. It's OK, see. Did Shengun last time out? Here comes Green. Brooks is wide open. Good fight. He has three. Down the back. There you go. Stay down on the shot face for S.K. You can have this ball hold. It's a much better line. Luke Dorkn, along the baseline for the mid-e and. He'll just smell his thunder. Knocks it. Good give up. Good job. Both ends, Jalen. Back to Gidey. He lays it up and in as he had had. Shot clock down to three. Janko, the spin, the step back to Luke. And the mid-e and that go hole. And that was a thing of view. Shengun has to win that matchup tonight for the Rockets to have a chance in his ball games. I hope you watch it about it. George, you know very little push. Fred will shoot. Fred will score. That's 30 a per day. This second three. Don't want to begin comfortable. Look at a man and a man. Topson stuck it from behind on Yelges Alexander. Leave the break to Wimmer. Slay out the Wimmer. Next season they were the best in the league last year. Keep the ball in front right here and stay down. Yeah, this Jalen only checks it for the other Jalen wins. Free himself up with a layup that will count. When the players play hard and they roll into it, bought it to the game plan and we're seeing this right now. Topson on getting the spin the lean in top foul and hit the shot in one. Over the last couple of years, the Rockets can take advantage inside. All they scores again. You can be more confident in his abilities. And Oklahoma on the city finally scores. His eyes get big when he sees that thunderblue. Williams in the lane bounces down. He's physical on that drive to bar. Couldn't recover. Good morning crossover. The drive and the score. Here's the help. The kick. There you go. The three go play. Good. That's so much better than Rockets attack. The WC. Deflaked away by Smith on the cut by a home run time to beautifully. Here comes the men. Topson, the duck under the score. The whistle. It will count and one biggest lead. Go to the alligator. Spitting on green. Got there and put it in. I think they started the year off like 150. They know how better lately. Yes. Overdoors. Playoff series. The lockets and thunder. Okay. See and use to know each other's most common. Playoff upon it. Dating back to the franchises days in Seattle. Nine different series. Just tough Thompson right there at the rim as he was going for the dunk. You don't get it. You don't get it. Chets five. That's going to happen. He will block your shot. That's going to count. I believe you really got to play through Shamgo. The home brins at the bar have got to make up the fan. You have to make you work on that end because you can drive it to shooting. Yet he takes it away from him. Too slow. Alphe has the mismatch. You got to go. He's not worried about the double two. Home brin, hoist and hits. Second three for him. Early time out. Home brin jump pass. He'll just Alexander the cut and the John very special. And he needs spacing against the runner. As home brin drives, banks misses. The rebound to Shamgo, because they play the pass at length so well. Fred van please. But I'm pretty low. Fred van. Fred van. It's a shop locker man there. It's him to eat my bread. Yes. I guess so. Dork got off to a great start. Here comes three dollars. Switch to the right hand. 40 home brin that time. Good pace. It stops again. I think it's so much more free flowing. It's like Yilkes Alexander. Two defenders went by him. Freedom. Green again on the route. Again with the line. She comes. And count it. Over the top. Home brin. Get he got it back to Williams from the wing and he buries the three. Now Sid Gone has Joe defending him. Not a great pass. Here's Yilkes Alexander. Mike goodness. Smith. Back out to Dork. The swing is a really good shooter. Joe got it. Two forty three percent for three. A career high. He just stopped him. Green got it. He got foul. No whistle. Back on zone KC. Joe for three. It's no good. There's Williams. And the thunder. Have their first lead. Since it was twenty seven twenty six at the first quarter. Draw more attention on his drive. Oh my goodness. And then for Shed Gilges Alexander falling down the west. In this second half I'm going to call it right now. You need a big game from Alfred Schingel. And the Rockets are really going to struggle to win this huge shot there. Looks needed from Fred Mickley. He's playing the Dr. Spock he's making plays and he has been incredible for us. Here's no question about it. Absolutely a big time. This is the first time. There you go. Bucking bust a foul. Rockets have regained the lead. See you've always got chance here to match up with Chet. Thanks, Dr. Shed Gilges Alexander. I was in the Joe Wild open along the baseline. Get set. The play just took two seconds. Smith from the Out mid court. Javari Smith Jr. Rockets only scored 21 points. In the third quarter, the 28 turnovers shot to 725 from the floor. As Chet Holgren went up high and came down hard. And got the Rockets. They were really good at the first half. He's feeling it. He is feeling it. Holgren. I didn't. See you've already forced that up. Good help by Hayward. Holgren has seven points in the quarter. Get it off the glass. There's Holgren making 9 in the form. It's getting away here from the Rockets. Green with a turnover. 9 to 2 run to start the quarter for O.K.C. Wallace. Barry's the quarter triple. Rockets down 14 to 30 point turn around in this game. As the Rockets at 1.4 up 16. Man bleep. Good. Got it, Chet. This is the one who's fired. They're on the possession. They can't be advantage. He's got to take him. Go back. Holgren. Holgren. Another one. He is on fire. We're at the Oklahoma City. The cupboard is stocked full of them. Future graphics. Yeah. In addition to this big such a draw. I'm going to get it. Holgren rising up, ducking down. My goodness. He's putting on a show absolutely. Oklahoma City led by Chet Holgren on fire. And Chet has been so much better into his wide open Williams for the slam. He had more so he's got to find a way to defend. Wide open. A guy shoots about 46% from three. That was a mistake. They're saying, hey, we're still developing. We're like, you guys look a whole lot better than developing. Chet Holgren is a flying stop. They made 17 threes. 50% shooting for the thunder tonight down. And now throw it up. Chet Holgren. The struggle was second half. The rockets could not deflate. Too easy. Final seconds ticking off. The rockets were outscored. 66. 48. Here in this second half. The Oklahoma City comes in here.
