 You ready? You game? I'm game. A massive test for the Clippers who are neck and neck with the Thunder. Can you be able to work right there? Like James Holt, you know, the car lives turn over there from Harden. Luke Dork leads it up and in, and it is a quick follow strike throw for Homesy. Homesy comes man the other way from the line to the lane, challenging Humber and No, but there is James Holt for the tap in. Holt, we're in the corner for free. He's a great shot blocker. He is a very good three point shooter as well as a rare combination. Runner for heart, and hits the front of the rim, trickles in. He's got both buckets for the Clippers. They've got the live rigs and he's over the stripper's. Upshot for George, able to knock it down. Nine to shoot. You'll just out-exand if a three that is good. George, around Jalen Williams creates the space, stops on a time and lays it in. I mean, how good is Paul George at that extended Ural stem? Billy just stopped all of his momentum on one foot and re-calibrated. Nice shot by Kauai Leonard. Clippers jump out of front by three. Spra comes up on the other side as he took off from the left side and lays it up on the right. Leonard on the rookie Wallace, fades in fires and might take Spruck. Kauai Leonard knocks it down. He puts the Clippers out in front by seven. Kauai Leonard lays it up and it numbers five four. Jake Gilgius, eligible to enter picked up by the Miracle. This is Jalen Williams. Isaiah Joe Baker, partner knocks down a three. A possible four point possession. It is big swing of events right there. Kauai, tough shot rattles it. It is playing double figures. I'm 40 to play in the first quarter Wallace. Williams, Leo. Let's look at what's at. Coffee in the corner for three. Bucket for a mere coffee, a big three. He's cloning with a rebound. A head to coffee with Joe to beat Tudorim and in. Comet in a foul. Tell him to give it one. It's a long opportunity to find a ringside here. A hole for the Honda City. It'll have about two seconds on the clock. He would have outbid his first game since December 26th, which was against the Clippers as well in downtown Los Angeles. And the three falls for Wiggins. Ongren all alone for three. It's good. It's his second. Martin with Wallace in his back pocket. Howell in the corner for three. Oh, it's his part place. He knocks down the tray. It's 44-39. Martin for three. That's the lottery. 54-42. 720 to play in the first half. Timeout. We take it with him. A hole for three. A tie for game. Shake you'll just have a gamble. One of the masters in the mid-range for the modern day. And then one for something else. Howell in the corner for three. Oh, he put it in again. It's third three. For three in the lead. It's good. 53-52. Clippers by one. With his Alexander trying to create some space. With defense by Harden. Williams gets that one to fall. Tyloo on the sidelines running a travel. He may have a case. Dork on the wing for three. It's good. That's 10-3s in the first half. We'll play him a city. The move. Leonard, flip it off the line. It gets to the nail and knocks it down. You know, it was really good. Half-court defense. That's half-by-ok. C-by-5 of six from the field. He'll just have a jambour. It's now seven of ten. Hawaii the runner. Oh, it's going again. Hawaii with a dozen. Clippers have five. Wide ball turnovers. You in the first half. Dork knocks it down on the mid-range. Hawaii clean-looking the mid-range. And he puts it down. And Kauai Leonard is now seven of eight from the field. Great defense by Zoo. And then Dork left alone for the three. So they're giving up that space and giving up something. One mid-range master to another Kauai Leonard knocks it down. He is now eight of nine. Right there is an example of that. If they make an example of the communication break down, once again, Kauai came up off the baseline. Only one. Jorah Stumble, 100 attacks. It's a jorah. Last touch by Zoo. Go to his Alexander. Isaiah Jorah for three. He's got seven in the corner. Talk to him about him at shoot around this morning. He said if he attention to Zoo. He looks at everything. He makes players comfortable, including Kauai with his shot lowering his relief. And certainly made a big impact on OKC. He keeps his bite, Dork. Takes it straight to the rim. Luke Pavan, new dork's defense. I don't need to see it again anymore, George. To Zoo. The flush. Great play by Paul George. Gildes, Alexander for three. It is good. Five to shoot for us. Potten entry. Gildes, Alexander, stop. Hold it down. One match again. Zoo, hit from behind by Williams. It's a block. Look at him, Zoot. Thomas Hitty. Joe, his third dunk of the corner. Gildes, Alexander, stop. Hold it down. One match again. Zoo, filling the lane. Blocked from behind by Williams. They get a fresh 24, saying that the thunder had possession. Kauai, Fades, and Fires, and fills it up. He's nine of thirteen. He's got 20. Wiggins. He's an encounter on the foul. What are he's hitting from above the arc or inside the paint? He's scoring and tripping with Gildes tonight. You'll just Alexander with the power play. Side steps around. Power forces up the shine. Picked it in. Time out for uppers. 88, 79. Thunder out in front. Gildes, with an open shot. Gildes. Williams in the corner for three. What a sequence for Oklahoma City. Power in the corner for three. It's good. And at a time out here for Mark Daniel from Deer and Williams. Inside, lays it in. Fort Liverpool. Easy lane. And this one getting away from the clippers. George lays it in. The clippers. Nine for twenty-six from the three point line. Oklahoma City. Fifteen of twenty-nine. Home run. Comment on the foul. You know what that looked like right there? Little par, George. Harden. For three. It's good. Harden now has twelve points and six assists. Gidee. Comment on the foul. Harden. For three, it's good again. Second three, time out Oklahoma City. One, oh six, ninety. Can't do that though. You can't be. If the best play the defense all night on the coverages. Coffee. Gives it to home grin and puts it down. Clippers can take advantage of it here. George on the wing. Free for three. He got it. A quick five-mo strike for the clippers and it's down to twelve. And there we go. Jalen Williams deep inside. George comes up, raises him. Gidee. He finds a drive on Zoo. The running drop fired up and Josh Gidee is hitting jumpers and threes. He's been a reluctant shooter. He'll just Alexander for three. Home grin with a rebound. And the put back. Time out the threes. Three fifty three to play. Thunder by sixteen. The one with the flush. The volume was dictated upon chillm there, pretty much to get those open shots. They're getting outside. The British did have a practice yesterday and a shoot around this morning. The scene for Oklahoma City. Jalen Williams stepped into a three. And now it's one twenty one oh three. Oklahoma City points to win the season series two games to one. They'll have the tiebreaker be in the Western Conference. For some reason aren't able to complete the deal against those type of teams. Austin knocked down the jump shot, 121-107. It is a tough challenging schedule for the Clippers to close. Good punish for Joe Williams and the Thunder. The millions for three, no. They would lose in that second game. There's going to be no doubt that they're in the playoffs. Why are you thinking about it last year? OKC coming out of the All-Star great-grandson. A tip they were in, a tip in the low 500 last year. 129-107 the final. The Thunder will win this season. The Thunder will be in the mid-game. The Thunder will be in the mid-game. The Thunder will be in the mid-game. The Thunder will be in the mid-game. The Thunder will be in the mid-game. The Thunder will be in the mid-game. The Thunder will be in the mid-game.
