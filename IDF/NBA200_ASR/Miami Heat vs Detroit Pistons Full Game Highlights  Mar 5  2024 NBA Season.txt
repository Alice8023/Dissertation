 You ready? You game? I'm game. Steve won the season for the heat and off we go on another Miami Heat NBA adventure. Crossquirt for the J-DNA-V3. And during the offensive pool. Well the best of the league at that. And for three. As he defensive rebound he even have to pay attention to that early in this game. Duncan gets three for the three and buries it. One point, Pistons look. Jimmy against J-9. He adds BAM against Cunningham. Or defended him well but almost second. Stewart against Yolfage. Good help from Bumble who recovers back to his man. Helps out with Thompson who gets free with three on the shot. Clocky lays it up. He 21 year old rookie originally from Oakland, California. A sore top's twin brother of a men's top. What a move. Oh Duncan Robinson. A screw ball for the one. That's six eight protecting the ball well. Cunningham with a right hand flush. Fight on top of you. So he threw this opening frame here in Miami. Cunningham. Arted by Butler. Reaching not to free. Gets it back from Rosier. Oh put on the brakes. Put up the two is J-9. He flew into the first row. Rosier. Oh he lost him. He lost the ball and slipped awkwardly. Stewart down the middle. He heard Amy talk a little bit about that of the pregame. Showed they have 28 points off turnover as at Orlando. Had last last game. Yolfage with a baseline jumper. And a 30 point game against the eight last year in eight. Four point he leaves Rosier baseline. Gets the bam for the jumper. He's missed his first three shots tonight. Ivy on the pull up makes a tough shot. Two point he leaves. How cares Junior in the game from Miami. Your place as Butler came with Martin is also in. Duncan. Kabo. But I could grab this in there with 155 trays issued. Number 22 of the league. Three double and Caleb hits the scoop. Evan for is here for the pistons. And that is James Weiss from the former Golden State Warrior. Well, in the Robinson in the game set the high screen for Yolfage. Swims it out the high screen. That's a big difference from the college game and the range. He'll get more and more crumple. He's got good form. We saw spot square. He was really efficient at it. Ivy's shaking right with Hock As. Martin on a try at school. Who it was at 10 point lead has been cut in half. J 90 crosshoping. Pishing it back to the rookie sassor in the corner to find Tekio for the triple. Not so young after him. He's in the lead. Martin with a wide open three. Kabo. The fist there on the reverse by 40 and a good save in by Orlando Ravitz. Five point, heady. Here comes Hock As. Oh, like the bright line. Got all 11 points in this quarter. Caleb again. Kabo. It's up. Oh, throws up the wild hook. The rebound and Duran. And he slams it through. Good job there hurting Miami on points in. And a second quarter this season. A five minutes left in the head by nine. Look out. Duran got free. Tekio had him. And bam. Just two for his first eight. Stuart. Oh, he was off balance, but he rolled it in. Isaiah Stuart with six. Just to drink that OJ with the six stitches. Bam with the swing. Shooting 57 percent. Only a slim margin right now. I can't fronting Duran down a low post. A short toss and a pull up. And Ram Rossi knows of what he speaks of former pissants assistant for repissants. And he did coach. Hook up there. Duran slamming it in the live room. He won 15, 18 and 23 games with a never stop grinding in Dupier. Tuck it off glass. Shoot that again with some touch when high off the glass there, which really softens the shot well above the box. Here's Duran the compact spin in right hand jam. Looks indecisive to me. I'd love to see him pull Duran a little further away from the basket for that midrange jumper. And Madison Square cards against the Nicks. We resume the action here. Third quarter begins with a heat ahead by one. Stuart missing the hook got it right back. Here comes Stuart. Pissants with their first leads into his nine to eight. Coming in for three. My V gets it from Duran Bob. Stuart. Oh, he got fouled by Rosir when uncalled and Stuart skewered in from a slam. But get it out of your mind that the Pissants are beaten down losing 51 of their 60 games. Maybe look at it. They're a really hungry group. And they're playing like maneuvering with chops. Feets bup. Draws to Rosir shoots the three. Kaboom. Good team basketball bupler passing out of the double. And the young man Yobich is the guy who's getting them out there quickly. Duncan brings up on triple. Duncan Robinson with 15 points tonight. He's all the way spun around and squared up and still able to get it to go. Oh, the pass by Duran picked off by Duncan Robinson. Duncan down into the, Living for the Panslam. After spreading his right ankle in the second quarter, he's seven point lead. Topside of the flying left handed champion. 21 year old rookie. You see the defense again is really clogging up that middle and take away bam and Jimmy's opportunities that opens the perimeter for guys like Rosir. Stewardly offensive. Duran out to Fontequeo got a good look at it. And knocks it in. 14 for this team is really competing. 4-0 missed the 3. Rebound batted out taken by Kaye, coming in. Fontequeo. Oh, it's stuck for Fontequeo. Here comes Bam. In an 18 left third quarter. Bam through traffic. Got it. And the foul. Under a minute left in this third quarter. Butler with three on the shot clock. A 20 footer. Yes. 20 seconds left in the third quarter. 4-0 thought about three. Pitches to Fontequeo. And he connects again. Took the lead, all nine to beat the pistons on opening night by a point. A similar feeling tonight. Bumper starts the fourth quarter. Rolling in the layup. Bumph, thanks. Feet it in a Thomas Bryan. And it's broken up and stolen by Marcus Sasser. Four-yea transition. Three. Beard. Evan four-yea. Eight-cutting in. 19 points tonight for the pistons. 12 of them in the first half. Weissman with a chance. Miami has gone over six from three year before it. Coming in, that's too easy. Planned up with a lot of confidence right now though. The closer this game is, they have a chance. Anything can happen. Want to see a little burst here for Miami. Bam's spinning on Duran doesn't go for it. Contested jumper, badly miss. Fontequeo hits ahead for Ivy. Ivy got it. Plus a foul. And the wizard's two more times. And he's right here shortly. You got to set the tone here. 5.8 lead. 3.25 to go. Ivy rolls it up and in. 34 to play. An adventure to be sure. Rose here. Gets them. Terry Rose here. First score in the fourth quarter. Here's Terry. For Robinson, a three-in transition. Cubo. 21.7 assists tonight. Double-team. Off to Fontequeo for the three ball. And he mixes fifth triple to game. He has 24 points. Okay, coming in. Six on the shot. A huge possession of the game from Miami under a minute left. Jimmy slips in. Scores. Need a bucket? He'll get you one. Now Fontequeo defending. Jimmy a three ball. Yes! The finishing touch from Jimmy. Moves to a half game of a New York next. He started the night in fourth place. And Philadelphia is down by five.
