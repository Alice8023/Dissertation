 Bind for 75 last night in Cleveland and they still lost the game. They'll be a little dinner party after practice tomorrow. Yakuperta on the inside clock down. Here's RJ corner play from Mrs. Saga. Luke Adonchich, shop doesn't go. RJ Barrett with a rebound. RJ into the front court kicks it. Gary Gray. But man, I'm looking at the defensive end as well. How about Scotty taking it a challenge? Luke, about RJ Barrett being strong. I cue on the inside of Perthle. Tiny date. This is the opportunity right here at Met Smaller Body. But what a work. Yaku, he's just in one of those spots where you get to the line. Things aren't working out, Scotty. Working out there. T-shirt. Young players third year guarding one of the best players in the NBA. Right idea there. Turn over. Here's Kyrie behind the back. He's got handouts. Top of handouts. And he knocks it down. That's a good company. Good. Gotcha. And Washington gets behind. The defense in a timeout taking a bike dark go. Why not project and say this is somebody I want to leave my franchise or be someone that we can build around. Makes sense to me. Don Chinch. The upvick. You have to watch out for the three. You quickly Barrett. Perthle. Trent Jr. Bruce Brown checking in. Daniel Gafford also acquired it to deadline checks in. Hardaway in a blocking fight. And Berthle on the glass with a rebound as a Raptor's lead. Fight three quickly using the screen. Attacking. Whoa. Little this little bit. Since January 1st, Brady is shooting nearly 59%. The corner brings. And they're going to count the buckets in nine rebounds. Don Chinch. Here's Hardaway. Three does it go to rebound. Gafford on the inside. The action's just back screen again. Drew two players going to Scotty leaving a wide open. Most dangerous player. A lot of times is the screener. Hey. On the inside. Gafford. Hey. Scotty. There's a linux. Unless it's a layup. He really likes the pass the basketball. More of it's looking to score it in La Brada way. You can do that. You see Derek lively over top. And then use is actually the basket to help him out. Exactly. You called the round the spot fighter. Use the rim to protect the ball. Don Chinch. Fire is away. As a Raptor, but overall shooting. 40% from three on this season. It'll come. Continuation. I'm not sure how much he can affect it, but I think you do a much better job than others. Check it out again. Scotty gets right to the 10. Excellent. Checking in the denial by Scotty B. Gary rhythm. Gary rhythm. Bukkin. Bukkin. Shop doesn't go. Here's hard away. The three is good. Scotty. Quickly the three. Seven on the clock. Scotty B. Skinning. Battling. Stays like it. Stink to the bliss. Shooting the blood out the ball actually. Here's Scotty. Back to quick. The three. So this. Through that skip hop or dance. And he said that it's all in the moment. It's just something that just comes naturally here. Naturally, but it's also the biggest indicator of him having gone out there on the floor. I like to wrap the switching up the defense a bit. That time, they're switching the picker rolls. He likes the fact that they're getting to the paint. But they want to make good passes into great passes and they'll have their defense and leave their offense here in the second half. Mott. Wibley with a two handed slam. Good lead. A heart jack. And I mention to you, man, I like to have that good action. I know. Scotty having this assignment, using his size, using his ability to make it more difficult. I agree. Over. The outstretched arm of her. And rolls off the back of the iron. Use concert to tacking. Swing it. Kyrie, don't you expect that last lively. Double slams more games. He has seven in three here tonight. Kyrie cut off five. Herald stays with it. Here's widely active with the offensive legs. So you've got to make sure you stop the ball early on. So you can allow her to get back under the basket. On the 10. Good move. This four, seven from three has got 17. Green. Here's Washington. The lively takes it away. Wibley broke his nose back in January against Orlando. He's got that hip plus the foul. And this is with stings, right? Donuts. She's got that size, right? Bruce Brown, hurdle. Trent Jr. quickly imbarred. Brown trying to deal with Donuts. Here comes Perl. All that. And then that. We're going to smile. Again. IQ. The touch. Weekside hard away. Leap pass. Washington. Because you start seeing he's on the scouting report now. That's really a gap for going all the way out there. A month ago they might have stopped showing. Got you. He's got 27 point game. Quick. In and out. Leap pass. Gap. In a foul on quickly. We bow for Scotty. Scotty. Brompton. Leap for Brown. Brown. Loads a layup. Donchitz. Gets the bucket. Catch the action on sports that would have sent PME's there for PME. You're right. What? Charlotte struck him this year. Here's Hardaway. Jones corner three. Good. 10692. Brown. Burdell. From the elbow. Scotty. Nice ball thing. That's a good look. Got the ball on the floor with speed and paste. And found the shooter. I agree with the bucket. Sliathering through. You didn't finish it but you had the maverick have to get back. Quick. Tyree time. Quick. Leap comes away with a repal. Leap time left to put together a wrong. Count the bucket. Continuation. Tyree. Combined for 48. And not smooth by Burdell. And I would like to see the rapist double team carrier. I'm looking down to this one to pass outside of the double team. The 101. He's magic. Fuck it. This again is very similar plan when Lebron James won. Lebron James to beat your score. You don't move. You break it up. The window. Still very tough match up for anyone on the floor for the rapist. Tyree pulls up. Yeah, he's feeling it. 20 points for RJ. Tyree with a left. Wow. Tyree. Good job by a linnick. As you mentioned, the bigger body. Bigger body hands high. This is the challenge right here. The blue box. Count it. And one. And the raptors regain win streak comes to an end. Galicy drop to the roll. They win one tonight.
