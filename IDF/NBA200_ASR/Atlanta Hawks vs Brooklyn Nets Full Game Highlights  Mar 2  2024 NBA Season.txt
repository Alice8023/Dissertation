 Copella jumping it up where it clamps it. And that net's at use the tip is constime, Johnson let the way what 29 points Player 4 School can move out and put them into that off the mark. Riches and there is Murray with the answer. Three points game is tough to win. And this is the switch. Murray attacking Fade and connects. He can put them on the basket. 10-5, Fox. Riches the low dribble. Over Zayn. Count it. Yeah, the net's continued to struggle from the outside. Three of nine. Johnson. Feats it. Fade. Little euro gets itself underneath for the doose. Murray over-shruder doesn't go. We bounce snag by Shard through the legs of Shruder. Scooped up by Johnson. Driving in. Come back. Count it. And a foul. He attacks off in some glass, getting extra opportunity. That's trying to dig in defensively here. Down goes Shruder and Fade takes advantage on the penetration. And the Hawks have stepped up their defensive intensity, getting a pass in lane, pressuring the ball a little bit, causing those contrinos. And Hawks are hit to another rainbow jumper. The lead is 12 for a win. It's her. Oh, nine for three points territory. Hawks are four of eight. Murray went on one with Wilson. It is again, post up. They probably could have gotten a foul on Smith in addition to the bucket for Fernando. The getting good shot. Good looks. Not falling. The screen for Fernando. Drive 10. Slash it down. Smith trying to make something happen. Feed it. Jalen Wilson connects for three. It's going to be good. About down of it, you get to touch. Fire is over. Blackstone for three. Smith tosses in. Blackstone looks at the clock. Takes it in. Nice fake and lead for an endo. Big bit. Blackstone. He waited. The patient pays off on the cut five. Finish Smith. He was wearing a boot the outside of the bucket. Yeah. That was probably the only way he could get around comfortably. He day drops in a tray. Stacked in here. And Johnson shoot over it. He can. Grimming in on a three. Great great. Great patience. Screen back away to the ball for open three points shot. Very nice. Bay breaks free and nearly brings down the backboard. That would be great time. Great memories. I mean, I play with him. I was the great point. Our great team made some waves. But Cal bridges put it on the board. It's a three. Just based on what timing. Yeah. Cup, hella. Too easy. Chance at a three point play. Next are up to seven of 16 from three point territory. That's 44%. Boxer down to seven of 17 from three 41%. Bridges. Nicely done. Bridges. Now that lane opens up a little bit. That's your trading buckets with Atlanta. Shoulder contested. He crushes that three. Box trying to ask to their lead currently 51.44. Again, they get the matchup they lauded. Capella swing corner. Hunter. Count it. But a foul hauled inside in the paint. The past of Bridges. Clakson now gets a touch. Wants to work against Capella. And he's at end. Pushing the base. Smith waits for his teammates. Give it up. Finish Smith. Just Smith, wait. That's a great. Great comparison. Half-court set. Truder thought about it. Fourth to give it up. Bridges. Try to get Murray off balance. Smith corner. Got him. Go. His first half. Nets a trail by as many as 13. Currently down 59 of 54. But he slips all fake. And the longer goes for DFS. Bridges. Quick stretch. Got it. On a two-for-one. The Calibriges. A catch is in. Six second difference. Shot clock the game clock. Swinding down in this first half. Murray. Over Clakson. Got a three. Making those shots a little tougher. They're getting on and running. And knocking down shots and down. Johnson. Shot clock is down to one. Johnson. Shuffle the feet. And an excuse me. Bucket. Bridges. Jumper. He's got it. Cupella. Couldn't finish it. But Conovitch is there. That will go. Long rebound. Bridges. Now it's a race to the rim. Bridges is going to win the race in a way it is. 842 to go on the third. Bridges. Drive. Quickseroom's in. For the bucket. There. Seventh to sixty-four. Give it up. Jalen Johnson. Cracks it down. He ladies the gentleman isn't as good. He's a set up artist. He does a great job of getting guys going in. Kind of gets himself going. They're going to need him to get going. Put some shots in. Well, now fall it down. Truder. OK. A three. Truder's a shooter. A lot of it. Using the stream, sweeping move. Tonight by Claksdon. Bridges. Quiet in for two. Bridges. Short on the delivery. But that's what you do. You just, you don't fight. You're fun. I want to see a big man allow him to go clean up the glass. Like he's doing. Kyle Pelon breaks free for the jam. To Defender. They run still having his hands ready to finish. Murray lines it up. And he knocks down a triple. Johnson, the answer? No. Wilson tips it out. That's going to reload. Johnson again. But a chance for four. It's Marilyn from NC State, right there. Jumper. Walker. Kansas. It's a fall deflected into the hands of Bridges. Next, we're running. Bridges looking for the angle. He's going. Bucket gets around Smith. The pull-off goes for Kobe Bucky. And that's trying to clinch the season series against Atlanta. That will give them the tie break if they end it. All nodded up at the end of the season. Johnson gets to the paint and scores. Neither team shooting of well in the slowest quarter shooter. I'm standing. Hammer chance. Here's the Blackstone. Feed it. But God of it, you thought Johnson was going to be there. Wilson running. Wilson to the middle. Clackston. A just and slams on a pirouette. That's lead by 13 and also outscored. Hawks 13, nothing in fast break points. Murray accelerates and puts it high off the window. The tough make it. Clackston with a double double. 10.12 rebounds. Bridges. The jumper goes. Bingo. Plus one. This time in Johnson, the Clackston shooter has done. Hunter cut. Baye. Dishing out some physicality. It's good and a foul. Atlanta chipping away. Chance to cut at the 10. Six to shoot. Shooter with Johnson. The cut. And the jam. Shooter with a perfect. I think Bridges is trying to force his way through a little window. Still, that's how you get it back right there. Bridges to the rim. But, shall Bridges. No tone. He is 4th. 13. He didn't shoot it well the other night as well. Johnson cut off by Johnson. She did. Around the perimeter. Shooter. Count it. It's a three. Forest in. Thuck in. Not a lot of space. Airball back. Rebound and dunk to move forward to get yourself into the playoff level. The play in turn of an opportunity. And they did it a different way for endo euros and finishes. It was wire to wire. I'll just let time expire here in Brooklyn. The nets get an important win over the Atlanta Hawks. I will score.
