 The other scrap would that prove some Houston in order to get it. It's a son. De Niroccheteer on Arizona's family sports. As Green able to sneak in, steal the opening tip and get right to the rack. Houston team that continues to trouble their three-point shooting and be on the ice baseline. Putt gets the delivery from Nercut. This is a Houston team that has struggled mightily on the offensive end of the floor. It's looking rising up over foot. That's why it's going up the garden. In a little shockwave. The move there. I'm not sure what that was the other night. It'll go down as an FGA is Kevin Durant able to work into the pain. On the private kick-bambley, it's able to get a hand up in the passing lane. Green on a strong private matter. He didn't locate him. I think if he did, probably would have rushed that shot. This is not going to be as easy as it was in game one. It could go out to controlling the temple. Their struggles over the last month has really had to do with extremely poor start. Knocks down the rainbow connection. Van Blee dropped a shin-goon screen and counters the Booker 3. Van Blee dropped a media double-team attention. Pass off the hands up ahead to the streaking green. Liding up. Little highlight. Slam for Jalen Green. They're going to roll and bring some little funter. I think they're going to die. I think they're going to die. The shin-goon loves that one leg. Good game. This is the back shot. Van Blee tries to turn the corner, picks it out to the open shooter green. They can't leave him. Green had 17-3-40 attempts to the gate of the night. Van Blee connects with another triple. Nice pass to the cutter. The rookie Thompson. Thompson with that length. They able to grab the offensive glass. Shit-goon. Time out Phoenix. This guy right here is a five. Van Blee's. Three and three. We saw this similar start there. In Houston, quick pass inside of the rookie Thompson. Whoa. On the fame. There's Thompson stepping out defensively on Booker. Gets to the elbow. Whoa. Leaping high. Able to get it. Where the put back attempt. No. Who's going to grab that? He's going to grab it. Well, that's three and four. It's not the mistyte their jumps on. Where the last work for Houston has been outstanding. Field back on the floor. Gets to the lock. And Phoenix. Whoa, whoa, call that one. Didn't even look at the room. Had the veteran green closing out on him. They're good. They don't look here. They're good in the tone. You got to take him to the show. Tough drive and finish. From Beale. The sun's right in the meat of Deak. Leaks. Most challenging. Stretch Ron is Booker. De-tangled from Ben van Vleet. It makes a pay. Step back three from Green. Katie rising out straightaway triple. Up ahead of a coachy. J.O. on the drive. Green gets bottled up. Shot clock wanting down. Nerf with the block. Green close out. Good time. That's the look they've gotten this quarter. Up ahead now to Green. Racing to the basket. Great health defense from Booker. There's Royce O'Neal. Goes down. Green not happy. O'Neal on a nice cup to the basket. Grayson caught somewhere between. Wanted to shoot and realized he's Jibari Smith. He's close to getting. He should have shot. He should have shot. Grayson, I think he gave Jibari too much bread. He could not have gotten there. Green all alone beyond the arc. Are you already doing that before? Katie to the baseline. Pull up. Man, she's an opening. Camers in hold. Driving right after the defender. Up and down is a different story nowadays. You got the jump. Right. That's right. It's Katie. Green's the bull. A Mari Stodomire. His name and number forever in the sun's ring of honor. Joining us is our special court size guest here. Jibari Smith connects Smith going baseline. And gets a couple of jumpers to go. You think back to the young as Mari Stodomire. And Katie going to work there on the baseline. Rockets leading. Rockets leading by nine. Rockets the open lock. Always great to have guys that you played with. Come support you as well. And Stephen Awa was the leading two guys in that movement. While the sun's continued to be pulled from downtown. Just four, eight teams. And Green. Back to back triples. Looker on the pitch. And a jump ball. And now Jalen Green shoving Bradley Beale. And he got coaches popping up off the bench. We'll see. There you go. Well, it seems as if Jalen Green kind of provoked a situation. The field is ejected from the game. Houston will shoot one free throw. Wow. Wow. He will resume with a jump ball. This Rockets team because of their propensity to shoot quickly and through. You see the drive here from Roy Sonia. And they got so many resources, valuable, veteran resources, former coaches who are willing to, you know, just finish that information. And Sonia will connect on the three. You want to take. Thank you. And congratulations on a long and long way. That's the third much. Thank you. Thank you. And look out. Royces got that book in his eye. Shengu passing out by Green to the corner. Wow. And gets the shooters bounce. And Shengu still trailing on the play. Beale, please. Connects on the triple at his core. And six more to deadly. Katie with a floater. And this Houston team has been so streaky with their three-point shooting. The top refers from Dylan Brooks. And he was too easy. He was left alone in the corner. Time for the swing that over the shoulder band leads. And he's shooting that up to that ball. His spin and sideways. And you notice every shot he makes is all net. He's got to do very smart to connect. Or another three. That is Young Inside. Put pass up ahead. The Young. Young squeezed initially. Went up with a left hand. Staged with it. And then he's going to the basket. But another green external. I don't think that was even looking for it. Off the jibari Smith on the run out. Green to the corner. No wrong rebound into the hands of Odee. Go ahead to the ran. Racing to the basket. Katie with a finish. The rookie Thompson leaping over everybody for the offense. The rebound put back. Roy Sonia with another three-point delivery. His turn. Thompson driving. Green a big your part. Pass to Rant. And draw the double or the Allen. Swinked it back to Odee. The open shooter. Pass up ahead. Now to Booker. All the drive through traffic. Gifts it up and in. Yeah, that was a high as it. And lead trying to get to the baseline. Sneaks through traffic. Booker stepping into the pass and able to steal. Up ahead to J.O. On the span. Rant got a piece. Leap pass up ahead. Not a Booker. Scoops it to J.O. Flies in. Let's whip this one hundred and twelve consecutive sell out crowd into a frenzy here. Van bleep though. White got another three-point knockdown. Green flies in. And a quick five-o burst. Ever the suns had pulled within one. Leads inside. Not finished. You almost feel like if the sun gets the lead. That'll be what a death to what it's going to take. Yeah, but the line into the credit. They are battling. Suns thirty-five and twenty-four. Biff in the West is Dylan Brooks. blows a kiss to the crowd. Double double for Van Bleep. He missed it. Pass an insight. Here is green. Right at Booker playing with five fouls. And they will get the finish. Nima Udoca. Not happy with the shot selection for Green. Katie on the follow. We'll get that one. And now Booker goes down. Grabbing is right ankle. Loose ball stuns. Still gathering. Dylan Brooks goes up strong. No balladone gets into the game. Shot blocked there by Smith. Rockets the plan to get there. Go home when they will play the next.
