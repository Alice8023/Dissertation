 Welcome to one. You ready? You game? I'm game. I'm game. Super upset about it. As we get this one underway, pulls in the tackle, having to start the fourth quarter as well. Chicago and Coruso are very familiar with downtown Barcelona's Angeles. We're used with the Lakers. I know the sumo. Maxic Coruso in the corner for three. That is the game's first bucket. That was Coruso 38% on the year. Pull the trigger on the three-point shot. VG would love to have that one back one more time. That wide open. Zoo down the lane. Down the hatchet goes. Second bucket for a VG Zoo bot. Throw it down. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. J4 out of the way. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. Red's economies, I'm here. I'm here. with his shoe when they have 15 or more three. Let it once the whistle doesn't get it. The sumo eats back by himself for the flush. The sumo with five of the 10 for Chicago, fighting for three. Handsoo and a C of red comes away with a lose ball. George Rhythm dribble for three. It's called for Paul George. George. He'll choke off the handle. Great defense five. The sumo but George knocks it down. Powell steps into a straight on three. Nice rebound inside and indeed the four man gets paid. So I learned it with the last five. Look at how to show it again here this afternoon. Derosen against the mere coffee right in his part place. I mean, he is almost automatic right there. DeMar Gerosen knocks down. Contention in the second quarter for the Clippers. Derosen contested mid range shot from a mere coffee. Sometimes it just doesn't matter. DeMar Gerosen is just that good. They can build up a couple of quick buckets in that we have. That's what you have right now is the Mar Gerosen. I see the pass inside underneath the tights. Beautiful pass. Tice came up with the ball in the corner. Two-scaruso invited baseline by Powell instead. Send it up top to Derosen. Derosen another mid range shot. Another bucket made. DeMar Gerosen with eight. It seems to me like has every bucket of Derosen been from that right here in the corner in front of the Clippers bench. George finds the scenes botan entry. Comment on a foul for Paul George. Jumping around the ball to come up with those rebound. George misses from the elbow and Derosen has the rebound boy, Chicago. White inside lays it in. Roots of it, you're crossing the lane. Off under pocket pick. Here comes James Hartton. No look ahead to Powell and he lays it in. Come on across the lane. Nice play by James Hartton. He has 22 hours in between tip-offs, which goes against NBA protocol. A shameful scheduling situation. And those responsible should be embarrassed of being very honest. We're looking for Clippers play on daylight savings time. That's it's bogus. 45-39 Clippers trail by six. Derosen inside. How did that a foul? 16 points to the paint for Chicago. 340 to play in this first half. Kyle Leonard takes it to the house and makes a little noise. A one-chote spin to the baseline. This is hard, no, it's 16. It goes in there. So when you go at it, he will foul. Roots of it's back the other way. And back and forth, we go 50-41 Chicago. The first half of the rebound, lucky to be down just 11 shooting 38% from the field. Letter on Caruso. It's a very friendly roll. And Kyle Leonard now with nine. The prison of the ball to start the second half. But it will be Chicago's least. Derosen going to the one from behind by Kyle Leonard bounds. He leads the way for the Clippers. Don't assume he beats the buzzer. And head to the horn. It's good. What a finish for Chicago. It's 57-46. Biggest lead of the game for Chicago, 60-46. Shoot in 47. There's seven in the floor right now, the goals. Karen's man tries to respond and does. Karen's coming into today's game. I can change into her. He goes hummus to the rim. This missed by George. Arcing pass down court to man. In a tap mode and lays it in. There is a sequence for the Clippers. It's up to the session there for the Clippers. Good defense there or at least intimidation by Bouchavits. And then the Clippers make their pay for it. As white knocks down the drain. Look who's going to fresh 14. George to zoom. Well, and throws it down great play out of bounds. Man hangs in here. That's nice speed from a heartened. It is 67-61 goals. White spot the entry. Loose it to ball. A wild winner in the other way for a two-handed stuff. In every single off, even he said, I saw all my workouts with finishing, watching found the time fine. Way to get better. And Avita Zubat has taken notes, Kristina. He flushes it down. George, the other way with fine 50 to play in the third. George attacks. We are tied at 67. We got execution on the out of bounds play. The new Chicago would switch the backpacks. Hard. Lofted it again. This is all he makes to grab and flushes it in again. 12 for Zubat. James Harden in that spot on position. Opposite corner. Right into the hands. Paul George make us proud. He knocks it back. Flippers by three. I'm Karen's man. How old? Again, accelerate down the lane. And the touch he has, I know there's a few guys that could do it, but it's a list of all. You could count on one hand. Chicago, all the time being, has been able to level it off here for a while. Leonard of mid range. He knocks it down. Why puts the clippers out in front? Chicago in this quarter, but time of possession. I have to think heavily favorite Chicago. Derose it from the foul line and nets it. 19 for Derose. And they put him in the middle of the floor. You don't want to double out. This is one of these the best, but are you? Got a wide open land. Bowling's a load on the lane for three. Oh, it's going bucket. Seven for Bowling's highlight off the bench. It's a Sacramento Golden State on the road. White for the lead. It's going. Seven seconds to wait. In the corner, 85, 83 Chicago. George on white. Draw the crown. Tice from the dotted line. And he knocks it in here. Time to 85. 29 for the league in pace. Flippers 26. Powell in the corner for three of the lead. Oh, George fired that pass, too, because he wanted to get it. A three. Oh, it's good. Thailand would turn off the bench. And the clippers lead. Blind 13 for the place. Powell alone on the lane. Got it again. Powell with 16. Time out Chicago. Right to back down on Dothunmoot. Turns the fire to the nail. It's every ounce of orange iron jumping around like a plinco chip. And it settles in 96, 88 clippers. These are offensive players on each side. If why have to get down lower, there's a three by white. He's come off again. They get a lot of freeze. Good look for Powell. Just couldn't come up with it. Powell's been great today. 16 points off the bench for Rousseau. Inside lays it in. And cuts a lead down to three. Time out clippers. The clippers on a 19 to four run in the third. Clippers takes some of the momentum back. Winner to the rim. And in the lower line of the climb with a lay at home. 98, 93. A lot of respect for them when you play them. The clippers are finding that out right now. Leonard double spins it up top to George. Extra pass to Powell. Defense. The bottom Powell makes him pale with the flash. If there's had the advantage of the hurry, George is alone in the corner. Great close out by white. Side stepping defenders and lays it in. What a move by Paul George. Strip by Karuso. And a power playing for Chicago. Right to the finish. This game far from over. Harden for three. It's a big one. 707 97 clippers. I never worry if he was ready to play when we ran off the home as soon as he'd get it. The Rosa, the boot of it gets in. 8 point gain. 103 to play. And the clippers were under 500. They've been over 500 ever since. It is a big deal. Time to change for the clippers. We've got down about it. A bigger fish to fly. Nice comeback.
