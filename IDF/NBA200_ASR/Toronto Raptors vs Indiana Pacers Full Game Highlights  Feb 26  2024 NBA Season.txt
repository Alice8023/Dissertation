 You ready? You game? I'm game. The starting team figure out as a combination how to get some things done. It could steal a little trap and by Andrew Nimhart you get to see. That's blocked by Barnes. A tremendous block. And now Trent Jr. reloads from three point range and hits. Here's a step back three. How the hell have you got it? The guy is with him on that one didn't play the hand it on the first one. Even though he thought he did. How the burden did not get behind the line or had a foot on the line. Here's Perdell cutting his bars who don't sit. There's a lot of time. There's a lot of time. There's a lot of time. Here's Trent Jr. And it is short. Got his own rebound put it in. Typically you see those numbers that way that means the team with the best at the bottom. No one is going to beat him. That's Perdell and a foul. That's chip. So there was no control. And now Turner who's already made one three hits again. Thanks J.J. on the Indian Authority we're ensuring sideline as the Pacers have the ball out of the time out. Here's C.Yacum team up a three. He's had a couple there. He's quickly launching a three and it bounces in. No soft from the three point line. Those things you got to do on the team like this is stop the ball. And here's Mathoretta McConnell, Toppen. Touches everybody and now Mathoretta lays it in. Paul moving at the great effort. 88% of his points are two point shots and most of those are in the paint. Olinic slides to the basket. McConnell gets there, overshot it. Smith put it in. What had to be great for his confidence to see one go in. You got to be careful. That's what he really wants you to do. Brown, a bodgie, Olinic, Dick. And the guy with the ball, the starter is Scotty Barnes. And he spins it in. It's so long. And the Pacers have it back. They blocked the shot. That was Smith blocking Barnes. Here's Toppen for three. Offensive rebound, Smith. That's great. That's a number of good players. The guys that get hurt, it's not just because you got back to back game. They're a variety of reasons. You need to talent, but disperse a little bit. See, I come out there with that second unit to now includes the rookie, Jarris Walker. And now they lob it up and throw out lead changes in four times. Olinic, back cut, Dick. Okay, now Walker's got it. He's got to do a better job. He's in the shaking because he's made mistakes twice. Barrett, Outs, Under, and a reverse leg up. And they're able to get over to his left hand. But the unfortunate thing I had to agree with you, Jarris. It's not easy. I mean, it's six weeks easy. And I'm not a doctor. I'm just telling you, it's that long before you come. On the Wednesday before the All-Star game, Perthal too strong got his own rebound, put it back in. They have 30 in the paint tonight as the Ackham too strong. Watch him pull, he's just doing it. Yeah, he was looking to go to the corner the entire time. Barrett on the drive. And a six point to run Oli. Good. And an over my goodness. Barnes short. Perthal the rebound blocked by Turner. Barnes got it and laid it in. Albert has just some points. And he has that blocked. He's just one of five from the field, Trent in transition. Tipped up and in by Perthal. Goodness. There's Perthal again. There was some bar handling in there and takes the faces. Quickly inside up off the glass. No good. And the two there again. Turner time come over and get the block. He's just trailed very little last night in the win against Dallas. Turner step back and hits. And he's just shot. This shooting over really good defensive players. Too many here from from the pace. Yeah, they shot just 42% in each corner and that's a back cut. And don't by Barrett. And taken by Nimhall. Good anticipation. That's just a heavy flight defensive. Math or an inside here. Siakum donks it. He's got to get into. Perthal the catch. And up and under. Yaka Perthal has 15. We have at least I'll take this one. On the efficiency. I have 15. Mathur and got it back. Shot clock down to two. He looked up a moment ago. He looked at the clock before he took the trip. And they got a fight. The Smith 4-3. Listen to the poker. Didn't get a physical milk that the shepard couldn't get to the basket. Shot clock at five. The bodgi is back in. Here's Mathur in for three. That's why you don't see him. That pass away from the basket. McConnell makes one. about six seven in a body and feel able to get that over the top for something about you. You can stay in this business for a living years. Here's a three again. Mathurin got it. Go scream for Mathering. Cutting Mathurin put it in. He's got 22. Raptors try to win three straight for the first time this year. Paces try to win four straight. Mathurin three to tie. Nice double nice double. We make it to make it. Dick for three. Reading Dick has 10. The Raptors. There's no moment with the pace. You can't go see up. Here is Dick again. And what a athletic boy in a heck of a pass by Warren. Shot clock of five. He knows it as you said. Now they double in here's a long three hits again. Great hand. The mile. Baji out to Dick for three. Right now the Raptors do. Three. This switch. This is a lane at the men at Guck's. Wickedly for three. And Toronto trying to do something. They have not done the issue. That's win three three. And the Paces are trying to go nine over five hundred for the first time. These she. And that's a basket and a foul by bear. Pretty Dick is. There's a good so looking, but he has made a difference. And here is Mathurin laying it in. He's got 34. Matching. Bad it out. Caliburgan re-loads. Four three. Good. It's a managing. Everybody can feel good about that. Caliburgan see a come and top it. Nemhart goes inside. Big sit in. It's a four point game. Oh good. Distance. He and I know they they want him up, but just over two to play. Toronto trying to make it two wins here in Indianapolis this year and Barrett drills a three. Quickly with 19. Here's Nemhart from Siacum. Top it. And he puts it in. He called if you have it in that corner. So that was what the complaint was about. And it was the way it went. And there's Barnes that don't. And that should do it. Toronto. Nemhart misses and that's going to do it quickly into the front court. And the Toronto Raptors have won both games here at Cambridge, be at house. Indiana won a couple of weeks.
