 You ready? You game? I'm game. There will toss it between Claxton and Jackson and we are underway. Zahir against Dennis Schroeder. Jaren has a size advantage and the Grizzlies head up throwing it away. Jorian Finney Smith, a look ahead and Claxton dumps Nick Claxton having the events will be in junior. Grizzlies want to run as best they can. Zahir Rurians has a grinding angle and Finney finishes that around. One thing we told Rolond our pinnacle is the bottom of the lead in this month. Backdoor cut and then a finish by the Kell Bridges, the former Phoenix Sun. Finish. Bridges. The Smith, Claxton under eight. Taylor Jacket's hot happy with the defensive rotation. From the small four position has been able to so to play making skills. The cards for three. Can Arrard have a lengthy streak of a knockdown to seven. Shruder. Curls. Turn around jumper. And the tip rebound ends up in the hands of Doreen. It's expected but I'll sign that. Not a lot in terms of getting to the best. And the Kell Bridges, Lisa's a three. And the first upset of the lack of a call. Bridges back the other way by Sharpton makes it up in the hands. Don't abandon rim runs. Rose sets up Jared's the dream. Because, you can build on that confidence. Jared backs down, lost the handle. Ficked up by Tantanis. That's a three is Lays by one. His first appearance of the night against his former team. Shot real well for great. Oh, GG Jackson. That was the... You know what GG stands for? What's the sample, Barton? Got game. Ten simons with the flush. Max has their point guard. I mean, he's been sending Z-Z here for orchestrator initiator. Because of his IQ. Back to the finish. And the finish by Finney Smith. Lob and a finish by Johnson. It allows Ness to end the shoot. 54% of Finney's nice back going here. The finish inside. 54 and 50 from the three point line. But also, shooter back in. Finney Smith out. Flags to back in. Here's Flags to go into the finger rolling and rolling it in. There are a lot of even put... What am I in for the first? Nine and minute. Of the second quarter. And immediately take them out by... And the bar steam is immediately makes an impact. Drizzy's stuck. D-Rose against shooter. D-Rose rises. Fire just fills it. It doesn't say the walking box. It says the Los Angeles Clippers with all the names that they have. It says Team in turmoil in some ways. Can't Thomas able to office a rebound? Get out. Trying to play with some pace. Bits off the bounce. Against shooter. Lost it. Got it to Lamar. A Stevens long two is in. Lamar Stevens. Fortunity. And that was for two points back in the first quarter. Fitting out. Squirt seven two. Shruder. Four three. Then a shooter. He's got eleven. J. Clarabus back in for the grizzies as well. 1.7. Claks and hits the floor. Nick Claks and misses the hook. Rebound. Fying to sway out to the perimeter. Lining Walker. The point. Drain to the free. And another grizzies timeout. Three point line. Drive to the basket. It is feast right now. We get mammoths. It's all feast of rookie. Is that your run? It's a feast. It's a feast. It's all feast of rookie. Is that your will? You put the pointer for the baseline. Yes, he didn't do that. Well, no longer is the onus on the coach. This one, these players going out for duty. They're hard. I said they have a sand. This is never lived. They're thrilled by this. Ready is 25. Nick Elfridge is trying to pax it in. And to your point, Grevin Brooklyn getting cancer. Able to turn the corner. Work underneath the goal. Shot clock down to two. Walker. It's the three. At the expiration of the shot clock. Paul Dama shot clock down to three. It made away three as an air ball. Shruder, two on one. Bridges the gift back. An extra pass at a claxidendum. Oh, we're working the next team. It's playing extreme. That deflected Bridges taps it out. Finney Smith works the baseline. Out to Camp Thomas. And open three. Perries it. Shot clock was unwary. When you allow NBA players to get a rhythm early. And to continue to that bottom play. It's my shot to that. I'm looking for. And these are the type things that can happen. Nets have also not won consecutive games over the Grizzlies. Since winning in March of 2018. Stolen by Jaren. Two on one. Euro. Yes. And the half. Corner three is out here. Hold on. Offensive rebound. Hooks it up. And there's his second offensive rebound of the game. Reball back on air. Rebound Walker. Miami Hurting going behind the back scooping and scoring. Steven's is in. Rose is in. She's Jackson's in. Lamire will post a jumper. Got the role. I like him. I like him. I'm not a board. You know, Tech Day, Rod Sharp. A little turn around jumper. There's a lot of things a lot of things a lot of like about Lamire. Steven. Let's everybody. Cam Johnson. 18. Three. Former North Carolina tire heel. I think with all the miss-himal from Jake Meraden is two. Trying to get his footing. Johnson. This is definitely what's going on. All the miss-himal from Jake Meraden is two. Trying to get his footing. Johnson. This is definitely what's going on. Oh, Max Simmons. Hey, we've been Simmons. Good work. Good work. Good work. Good work. Good work. Good work. Good work. Good work. Good work. Good work. Good work. Good work. Good work. Kind of jumped out. Laredia in traffic. Take Laredia. It was a night and some said it in a long NBA season. We're going to have those tight nights, promised with a fade-away. Tipped in by Finney Smith. Let me say what's on theicht of the dribble. Defending bigs at the Masquite Wing Flares, whoever. He's done a good job again. Oh, and then to follow a duck. Follow Lamire. on the pitch and when you put Lamar Stevens on the floor, he gives you something every single time. The truder now is 16 off that drive. Forget it, call it a call three seconds. None of his teammates could throw in the basketball. Lamar Stevens is good again. Lamar six for six. Two left hands and not to death. Lamar will try for three. Mango. Lamar Stevens, seven for seven five. Not the taste tonight. Wilson, Floder, No. And Deiront Sharpe doing what he does on the offensive glass. A lot of Navi lost the dribbles. I hear it. Fix it up. Go to the goal. K-2 baits D-Op also. But you are correct, Mr. Knight. We have not seen many of these for the grizzies just yet. We have seen a lot of steamroll and Wilson. Drain's a three. And our apologies for the fact that we missed you amongst all of these birthdays that are going on today. We have a lot of stuff going on. A lot of candles going on. Trent and Watt produced a three. Listen, Taylor Jenkins is... Why are we highlighting Mike Nois? He was a walk on for Yukon and played to Kevin Olly. Moravia got the finish. And right now, in terms of Wancey, a take-in-eye man watching a lot of quits. What he did, and I think for me, a big part is shocked again during what he does. That's me in that situation. It's not like the lead the game dictated and take me where it was going to go. But in this day and age, Steven's again, he was knocked down. That little bit of rain jumped shot. Really got it. A great coach. Navi! Ruma. Coach to coach. So that's a win at tonight 111 or 86. They have grouped at 22 and 35. They're 9.
