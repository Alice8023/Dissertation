 lose chance to think of our world **** What kind of complaints does Africa even get Past hamlet in the weekend in the Fuzma for three. Wizards coming off at overtime. Oh, Fuzma, a transition. Drey, you were talking about the clippers forcing the pace, but it is the wizards that have come out here on Oasis on a three 42 percent on the year. It's 10 to 6. Fuzma. Tarris Mann. He has found the score and touch and he keeps it that way. Really has played well. 55. Make a 51. The end down. Lane cradles the ball. It's a very friendly bounce. He's got four. He had 15. Tice left alone. The provoked a three. It's good. And Daniel Tyson's three for three. He leads all clippers with seven. With seven. George. Up to what? He had some up and down games in the month. Roddy when he's rolling and he's to come a better playmaker. That's sometimes as hard to duplicate. That Fuzma for three knocks it down. Kyle, let's throw a timeline for the two spots. But it sure would be nice if he could join a Sunday afternoon in the Minnesota called George. Pearl catches after that. Like this ball figure out how to play with James Hart and he said he's going to be the blue guy. That is not his role when he is shooting. Good things are happening for the clippers. Good defense there by Tarris. Looks to push. Strong and power. He's out there for Paul George. Passport attacks. And lays it in. Rims a rim. Per Russell Westbrook. Strong move by Westbrook. Two for two at the rim. But for the by nine. Cool inside. He's got a big bag offensively. He has all the moves. It's the feeling of top of his scouting report each and every now and there's a little bit more challenging. A little wider. Hunter knocks it down. Leonard now with now. I was feeling with you. Johnny Davis. Kisper. I like. I like 40 points in that first quarter to Washington and I pulled the other way. Reverse lay. Adios. George pull off the bench now with six. He's played seven minutes. He's taken a chance. Powered and celebrates. Domely. Coffee. loses his defender and knocks it down. Ice cream from. Probably down the lane. Cut it out. Oh, no. Cool now. I think he's outstairing against transition with your back. That little. Speaking of which. People are pulling his step. Now you've been at a higher frequency. It's allowing. The Celcian matters a little bit more. She's had an operate from that mindset. Coffee with power riding. Shot. Blow it up high for the flash. Who's the other way? Lays at. And. 54. They have talent. But unfortunately, a talent has it mixed to self together to win games. But that talent right there. You'll need a lot of dough to mix that. Sometimes. Ball can be a good. The vicinity from the perspective. It's just not going to get you know what I mean. Like that. The foul. 62 points with five plus minutes remaining. Who's the get away for a plus talent of foul? Too easy. I mean, that's turned over against the Wizards. Their fifth. Part let's it fly. Oh, it's going to get five of a kind for James Barton. Jones. Deep three. From all it is good. That ain't you. Man, you play. That's nice. Lobster man makes the crap and lays it in nice play from Daniel Tyson. Monster first pass. The first dribble is put the Genie in the bottle. It quarters three and four. Top shot for George. Oh, my. Oh, George. Calvin on a foul stretch for the Clippers. But an opportunity really to another three. He's got 26 in the first half. Who's that? Right to the hands of Pocky ahead to let it recruit but a big. How he punches an end. Hardens was electric in the first half. Get to the rim and remains that way. 23 for James. Hard reading the defense. James has done that so well in the first half. And now the plane was open. James, you could get there to finish. Speaking of which, there's a three. It is short. And there's collides for the rebound. Back to Hardens. Flames up a three. It's got again that is six threes for number one. The small fracture. One of the problems is just to hit. Hit. Get in here. The back screen. Opened up. Is at the bottom of the list. Get there to score for the wizards. Kuzma dribble drive at the lace and end. Kyle Kuzma now. What's 28? Letter. I guess Kuzma. Oh, Jerry's man punches. He does it down. You do that. You very good. You have that kind of physical power. Time. Salah, big finish for Tyson's side. And Daniel Tyson. He's a Tyson. The good recovery by Kisper. Five. Hardening. How about a better finish from a wide letter. Dropping home. Collide with 13 points and a rebound. Cool off the window and in. 94-70. Kuzma twisting, interning, fading, and firing. And he is just on a bender. Tonight he's got. Tyson misses the clever passing inside. Doesn't result in a basket. Kisper gets behind the defensive to the ram and in. And another break down. And Tyloo, despite being. He is just going to see Tyler. Going to Thailand to his tires. He's lost. Collide with a bunch of hands. 100 points here. I thought he was really good too. So about some advanced numbers that really had him as an engine for this. And he ain't side counted at a foul. A march for the clippers. Butler drives inside. misses. Gets his own rebound. Says the top side. The Kisper for three. It's good. The clippers lead 107-81. A break inside. Able to lay it in. One-twenty-one. Right to the corner. Right to the corner. Right to the corner. It was spotted on that time too. Let it, the three, it's gone. Collide. Let it with a massive third quarter. What this is to when you're in this situation, Brian, as a player for the wizard. The ultimate definition of the world. You do your job. And the outcome is going to be the outcome. And that's, I think how you throw in this really beautiful boot by Paul Simon. They're going to need all systems go on Sunday against the Timberwolds, a team that has led the left team. Paul and also quite played extremely well going to today. Minnesota go. And if you're just joining us, Paul George. I don't know how Paul just think this way. If they think this way, given the edge right behind that. So that's the area. You stay focused and concentrate on the defensive day. George in the mid-range. It's good. Paul George with 20. You had a chance to kind of take care of some business early to put yourself. Now you're relying on all of these scenarios to play itself out. But at the end of the day, let's say it does make you my best to stay away from it. Because the Avant√© comes with the reap it. Because it means something to these guys. It means something to Colby Drill. It's rising high and flushing it in. Michael Winger was a general manager told the clippers going back to 2018, maybe 2017 bigger partner. And was just you did a wonderful job. You've been on the sidelines and assisted and some great success in that role. Do you want to be a head coach? Island wrap around to Boston. He lays it in. He said, yes. Have great about him on the sideline. Count it and a foul for Omarouri. He'll go to the line. Just a little defensive. I think that is an interesting one. I mean, a lot of guys think about the Tony Allens and the Marcus smarts. But guys that really play and really have an imprint on the game because you can't be as physical defensively. But the rules just are not catering. It may be ugly and funky at the beginning, just like the old no-hand checking rule and an offer. But then when guys figure it out, they kind of make the adjustments towards the hands on the wheel, driving on the bright side of the road. All the lights are great here tonight. And downtown Boston was one-four.
