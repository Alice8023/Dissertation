 He's keeping his foundation PS43 in Toronto. What you like to see after the last two games. You love to see it a bounce back game. We had a couple of those, but you want to make sure as you see any other patients get inside Jackson and they will dominate the paint from the paint. So the Raptors have to defend that area. Scotty, the very first slam is going on the inside. Alabama gets it back from Neesmith and Barnes going for the steal. Neesmith dunks it off, Jackson with a slam dunk. And Jackson has been very impressive. Creating turnovers and converting them to points. For a pass-out of penetrating. What a guess, and Brown. I know there is so much focus on his shot. I want to play, if you want to give you the basketball, go get buckets. He's that type of player. Every offensive team will need an element. Here's Scotty Bay with the slam dunk. Shepard unable to come away with it. Here's Scotty Bay right to the air. And again, Matt, the future Raptors, but not often. She can't turn a ball over, he has to take good shots. Not boring to check. With the Raptors here in this first quarter, the fourth point lead for the Raptors. It's Brady up top. The ball peg, he's attacking McDermott. What's the shot up in end? He's Smith, McConnell at the foul line, deflected. First by Dick. Colonel gives it back to Brown. What can throw down? Stronger, the Raptors look like they're playing down 16 to Susquehanna. You know what that is. That's down North Philly where your family live. Brown, let's hurry. See, Ackle. Dumbled. And finds Isaiah Jackson. He was currently G League assignment. 20-year-old work, he was spent one year in the university at Houston. Six point lead. Alla Burton in the paint kicks it to D Smith. And D Smith along the end line. I like to make you laugh. What can you do, man? Scotty at the inside. The denial. The job by Scotty lead pass to RJ. Let's take a guess. Let's take a guess. To the pocket. Parrot. Paci's team, plus 12 on the glass. Who they're crashing. They're feeling really good. Scotty is hooping. Scotty is hooping. Two games as a drawn Raptor. And he is down on his to five on four break. Already without Miles Turner and Benedict Madhrin. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Fuck it, good. Best player in Tirees, Alla Burton. And Pascal, Siacco. Now in his 15th game as a pacer. And we'll quickly with the bucket. Quickly with the triple double watt. Seven rebounds. Seven assists in the first half. And Scalwood the three. Drive off their offense. The top offens an NBA. And you already see him just continue to go. You have to compete. You have to continue to play. Leave the referees alone. They gotta get stopped. Here's Siacco spinning. And the bucket is good. The first lead for the Indiana Paces. 30 point games for the great Pascal Siacco. And it's... And it's... Neymar. Recognizing the mismatch that Pascal has, he has quickly won him. And Neymar with a three. Neymar with a three. He's 33% on the season. The Anabyte three. Our chance instead of top. Brown gets it. It's blocked. Haliburne behind the back. And Andrew Neymar with a finish. And he'll go to the foul line. Rebound. Raptors lead by one. Quickly. On the move. In the foul. McConnell. And a great steal. The anticipation. Get a check. He's in up and in. That zone. Here's McConnell. On the end of the line. Jackson with a slam dunk. DJ McConnell. Good job on a Raptor. He said, man, man, but it's a match of zone really. Especially in foul. Looks like he just traveling a little bit. And it's gonna be a foul on Chris Boucher. Here's quick. Doesn't go. Weekside. Shepard lead has top in. He's in up and in. Point six left here in the third. Quickly with a dozen. And a push. And it's a minutes. The goal was to drop it in. War. Couple of great games in the Atlantic. Chicago. Scottie. 21 now. He takes it back to Shepard. And who's Shep gets aggressive in Jackson. With a put back and a shrewdder. Next Thursday night. And it's quickly on the road. McConnell off balance shot. Love that. And if I'll call, won't get it. Here's Scottie. And going right at Pascale. See, and then Scott, four fouls out of it. You guys are going fouls. He's backped on. So you know, Scottie continues just to throw that hill. Like a train. Top in. Lustling his way in. Got him. Go. Laura. Go break up in. Who say with a slam dunk. Pascale. With a left. Must have fouled it right into. 26, 13 and 10. Just one more hand coach. Scottie goes in. Strong. Raptors by four. That's just tough, Matt. And Raptors get it back. It's Boucher. Boucher. I'm the seed. And right on time. Just plus eight off of the bench. Bucket is good from the corner. Quick lead. Jack pocket five gets a little bit of room. Re does it go. I'm the inside. Guess who? Chris T. Shay sometimes you don't get the ball and take advantage of this match. But you can crash it off its address. Shepherd with a three. Second three in a row. He's the best performance in that hard at the elbow. Pastola. It's RJ Barrett. Barrett into the front court. Back in five. Scottie lays it up and in the Raptors by one. Siacum double. Halleburg wide open. So that's the second. Can't double on the Halleburg. A rotation that's usually done in practice. Gotta get practice time in order to be on the same page on the string. Quick lead. Tough bucket. We're tied. 121, 121. Close out by quick. Siacum with a move. Put down the shot. Banks it in. Here that the light was coming on and they said no, we don't want to challenge you. Just to time out. Get ready. Baytime. Bucket. Solid defense now, Matt. Solid defense. Pastol the bucket. Back to a three point game. RG. RG. RG. Attacking. RG. Spinning. RG with room. Shot doesn't go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
