 You ready? You game? I'm game. So you think they're both sides. You love having a Gallagnoordman pal to pop right in there and starting lineup. He's probably a starter on 20-25 with the 30 teams. So he's... Well, whites for the Clippers rode purple for the Kings. And they immediately work it inside the Zubox and I spin over Sabonis for the first bucket. Sabonis right backs to Fox behind the screen. Offensive rebound here are some barns in the put back. And Kuala Latter gets the steal. And can't knock it down. There's Murray in transition. From Herder, quarter three is good. And we asked again, Mike Brown, why he said, well, that's what we deserve. I mean, that's happened again. That was none guarded three. Herder, they got a switch. Sabonis trying to work on Harden. Well, he'll be good for Sacramento if he gets off to the Fox. It's a pick. Murray, third chance and they finally find the bottom of the net. Find some space. Now hits. You know, watching this guy shoot, you've watched you call all these games. He's got such a soft touch, right? He was in the rising Star's game, deservedly so. They're all star weekend. We're Fox. Last year's NBA clutch player of the year. Hose up and hits in the lane. He's looking to push some pace tonight. And the pick. Latter. He's, that looked easy, but he's so long. Yeah. We asked Tyler that, right? You asked that. It's an experience. Is his answer experience? I think that guy's a play in the NBA finals. And Norman Powell, Paul Dorgon, but yes, 20 points, not enough for these guys off the bench. Latter. Here's the air. Fox try to go to work on Tucker. Lefty fade is good. That's great defense. That's a timely shot. This is what's offensive re-bending instincts or some of the best things he does. Great second possession. He's really fitting well. People talk about him that guy has Fox again with a crafty move. But because you're going to wake up one day and look at your team and you're going to be there. They're OK in the next day. They're in the play. The one day knocking down the three after the Kings had missed seven in a row from downtown. They're back on top. Pardon. Oh, the acceleration to the left side. He just knows. He gets by the initial point of contest. He's. He's. Pardon the switch, Murray on him. And Harden knocks it down. The co-yliners right up there. If not, you guys. So it's it's a good chance for Harden. Month to subonus. Latter. It's back out there now for the Clippers. Zubats. Offensive rebound. Second chance points. Yes, that's it. It's got to be Aaron Fox. It does point for Deeran here in the first half to lead all scores. Barnes drills the triple. That's the fifth. Persexual. You would think here that Clippers second best three point shooting team in the league. And it's the worst defense. It would be a little cleaner for them. But here's a good look. That's a good look and a make. Barnes tapped away by Leonard. Another steal for co-yliners running with man. And back to co-yliners for the jam. Ten points for Leonard. He's carrying a big load again. Westbrook and Harden just three for 13 from the floor. It's Leonard. Hands and hits again. Back to a two point game two minutes to go. Fox, nice find. It's subonus. Caledon like it. Fox, nice change of direction. Got man to grow by. There's that double. He made it. And then they're going to make Terrence man make that point three. You can do it. I mean, that's the risk, right? So nothing's going to happen except for whatever happens here. I don't think. Now, I think Golden Straight and LA flipped at the bottom nine and ten. In that first quarter was four for five in the second quarter. And four, Domonus, one rebound and three assists away from that. 20 triple double of the season. Really been that health and they've that's what they performed so well. But herter again, this is 13 now. And Tyler, I'm looking at him. Stephen called. And she's had his and subonus just picked up his 10th rebound and another assist for eight. And then he gets the steel here. Fox. Is that going to be a hot-assist for the hot-assist? That's going to be a tie-down. The only guys to do that for an entire season, Kevin Garnett and Joker. So that'll be fun to watch and track Sabona's. Now he's failing it right on Zubox's head. Man off the window. Mike Russell, why can't I do that? Too late. I mean, that was pitch wetter. Anyway, it's well under does what he does all the time with a big red shot. But the new five, you know. It's nothing these days in the NBA. Sabona's out to Barnes. He's having himself a nice night. And the assist gives Sabona the triple double. There it is. Ten and ten. Very tired. Letters, double comes. Oh. Zubox, right open inside. Who is the second best shooting three-point team in the league? The clubers. The Kings are doing what their coaches ask him to do. The players with a seven-o'-round and holder will end that. It always is a big deal. So, let's take you right on the opposite. But this can't believe the no-call. But, you know, here's the... Mike Brown. It is 196th consecutive start tonight. That's the third longest group in the NBA. Zubox in the paint. It was wide open. What a round of mouth. And Sabona's with another rebound. That's his 13th. Mike Triple. Leonard off the bounce. Paul, who has a shorter grip? Double fours to the give it up. Tice. Harden pocket pass. Tice. Here come the clubers. That's not easy to do. We just have to get the possession back. And after making that tough float or two. Fox, feeling it. Oh, we lost possession on the way out. Re-gandon scored. Harden, nice find. Tice Westbrook. 17, 14 and 12 now for Sabona's. Parkie, to Zubox. Eight assists for James. It is 20 points. Mark. And that's it. Right now? I mean, that's what they're going to do. Yeah, be close. Because the darts are tricky. It's when you let go of the ball. Barnes for the three. And Harden's looking over at the bench. So what do you mean to do? The Kings have not experienced any lead up when Fox went to the bench. And they've actually extended the lead. Power. Get back to go. Get another rebound directing traffic. Mitchell wide open. Got it. That's a big shot right there. Just under four to go. And a two touchdown lead. Harrison Barnes will add two. They were up 8 and 116 double. So terrific balance. Six guys and double digits tonight for Sacramento. Fox, between the legs. The stagger step and the basket. 123 to 107 will be your final Northern California over Southern California. Thank you.
