 You ready? You game? I'm game. Point A to point B. So you want to speed this game or do? Curtis Blair, tosses it, the only controls it, and it's good to have you with us in New Orleans tonight. You've got to stop the basketball, bam out of fire. I think into the 15-16 for any prefers not taking freeze. That's not a part of this game. And on the drive, he gets it back to the easy one. The first two and a half minutes. Z got the switch. Trying to get to the baseline. On the reverse. He's closing out the vibrato game. Somebody has to flip this game right now because the energy's not there. Goodly, CJ sent it up for Jonas, ten point deficit. Butler choked off on the baseline. And throws it away. Yeah, herbs air. Beautiful up to the center. I like the crawl by Willie Green to go zone in. Jordan Hawkins. And it was blocked. Trades got it. Two foot down the new seven. Two foot down the nine. Yes sir. Four plus to play. It has been a struggle so far for the pals at the offense. And then to the four, they get stops. Robinson got home and couldn't get finished. CJ just heard it. And CJ turned an ankle good knee. Bad news. So the wait for Scott. Good Robinson. Same way. Jordan right there. Ooh. Is that on Larry? Yep, he's stepping Larry's foot. Yeah. Another free throw coming up. No, they're a man. Now, now man. Good back to Larry's going hard. Oh, elevation just a little. Stop like my daddy. You want to face? Get lost. Jose lost it. Unforged air partner. We'll go the distance and get the roll. And the foul. Miami does a good job at the offensive end of the floor. Jose of deep ring. Airball. Jordan Saising. Z off the window. Good pass by Larry. Real quick response. Seven point game. And Z to break. Duncan Robinson though you can't leave him. Many a time to set up. Why they said no. I got the coach I want. I'm good. You don't bite. Aren't you any bothered? Again, but he gets all the way to the rim. Understand? Nobody. This is their star. Right here. Robinson Earl. On the switch. Bother. On the step through the easy one. And he got the tap. And the foul. I'm with you. Sometimes the best move you can make is no move at all. It's her. Needed corner three. Needed to decide that. They're willing to give up. These are the shots that are open. But so is hero back on the floor. We're Duncan Robinson. Yeah. Good grab by the six seven shooter. Gets the triple at the end of the shot. Wow. Usually when somebody takes your pathway. It is cited. Z on the flip. Got me at the wall. Take it. He's figuring some things out. And it's also getting upset. If they continue to stop some of the next three and a half. On a bio. Gave it up. He was trying to get contact. And what a break on the reflection. Jose for three. A number. Time out, Eric's ballstruck. You got a mark. Everything worked with Miami. And blocked away by Jonas. Secondary defender. Jose. All the way to the hole. Reversed. I love this pal's bitch. Hero. Coming up short. Jonas clears it away. On the run. Lending one's pace. Her. All the way on the euro. Okay. Her goals. Up to your key shot. She got her right back. Going to the post. Got to know that a double team is coming. Jonas. Nice. And if they don't double. Big boy. What's the contact they allow here though? What's the contact they allow here? Good. Beautiful. Good. Nice. Good. Nice. Good. Post. But said they're going to come double. Yeah. Now the clear out. Right. You want to collapse. Got their leg. Yes. Yes. Hells take the lead for the first time tonight. Yeah. So there are down in Gen. Gen. Gen. Gen. Gen. Gen. Gen. Gen. Gen. Gen. Gen. Gen. Gen. Gen. Gen. Gen. Gen. Gen. Gen. Gen. Gen. Gen. Gen. Madness? Man. Man. In Hollywood. Patmie.iatr seleaer gucutte est skinny The 0. messulite sport Î≠ê rpm grillonus Yes. Cutbread from behind and she got the piece up it. Trygo time. Martin goes to the line, look at the3 point and play. Don't look at it to see it on the box, only. I'm on a box. Gagneride in and see it on the box. And have to wait until intersect. It didn't protect it, blow the dribble. Then I've on a pile all the way to the heart and object. And now you want to keep the ball moving though. He's got a hero. It's bounced around. And stays with the player. That's what it's just. Good aggressive, Jake. Right, good second bounce. Right there. It's game over. Z on the spin at the takeaway by Kayla Margaret. Now they turn over. Spacing is hero and points off the takeaway. Yolbic on the floater. Herb. Early offense. And he's got contact. Going to the line with the three players. Kayla Barton, man. They're not the way. We're missing two starters. Benches being sensational. Hawks in there. The back of the zone aren't they? And you got to shoot him out of it. And Hawk will. Got the trouble. Shoot him out of it. Hawker, again, got to go. And Z will go. And that's a, oh wow. Back at it. I'd say if he gets his hands on it, his hand. That's a great pass right to Hawkinsville. And now another second chance opportunity for the pals. Hawk midrange. Yolbic, I'll tell you guys. It's going to be nice to watch it, young mangrove. Serious point. He's a big debald. Five-voidly. Hawker, again. Leaving it off. Larry on the finish. I'll tell you. But the thing is, you have to honor his ability to shoot that basketball. All the way to the hole. Z on there. And no foul. Oh, man. He got it. He's going to lay. And he's held up by Katta Rob. But see, this is what happens. This is what happens. Oh, oh, oh, oh. This is Jimmy Butler and Najib. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not surprised because they let it go. Right. This is what happens when officials don't go fouls. They let it go. Right. This is what happens. He got away. He got away. Look at that. Tomas brought in front of Upps, with the Oakage. And we're in the middle of things. And what is Tomas buying doing? He's going to be a little late. Don't need anybody to get involved. After review, we have a two-shot foul for Zayar. He'll be a calm foul on Cavalov. On the obligation, Bryant will be ejected. Butler will be ejected. Avivada will be ejected. And Marshall will be ejected. So the penalty's already finished. Two shots. We'll play off of that. Good to end up. And Yard who gets it. Space. And the shot clock. Right. Slow to a strong side. And the runner off for a goal. You have to hold that side to attack. And good setup. Robinson Earl. Got it. Even in 86. Good rotation. Stay on the ground. You got to get up, Don. When he bets up, you cannot allow Duncan Robinson. That's basic. How about a three? Yes, sir. Here's the gamer, Joe. Off the high screen, hot calories. Quarter three has been real short. No, he's got it. He baked it. He didn't want to hit the side. He baked it off the glass. Joe never stops the hundred points in all six losses. That's a good mind as he vents his beer. And a vial. Yoros is way to the right. So the Pell's done the 38% shooting. That's the story of the game. That's a vial for the mid-brain. He owes it. He's had that since he came into the lead. He turns and he faces. Grandseezer. And he'll get it. Talk to him. The shot clock. We're not going to be cross the line of Miami. That takes care of it again. And the Pell's expense. So the Pell's will fall to 11 over 500. Miami goes to 6 over 500.
