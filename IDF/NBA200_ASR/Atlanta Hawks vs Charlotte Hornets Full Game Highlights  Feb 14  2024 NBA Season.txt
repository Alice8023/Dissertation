 Just now your starter brought you by your local Toyota dealer Hornets are starting with the same starting five for the third string against this entire homestand and trying to sweep this three game old saying about that. Miles Pritchett has an angle in a tech mode gets his own rebound and throws it out of the hand. Because he was in a tech mode in the box at straight deadline, the whisper is that possibly Dejante Merck was available. Heard they were talking about Dejante Murray for the theater. Dejante Murray actually just passed summer a three to a contract extension. It's not even start until next year. Nice pass by Tray Young. He's always been a visionary when I come pass in the basketball. Here's Tray Young. Haven't seen Young shoots ball yet. Oh my goodness. That's a lot of that. Beautiful dive to the cutting Jaylen Johnson. Manwitch that out to Cody Martin, extra pass to Brad Miller. At some water. Basketball. All time leader and made grease for a rookie. We're in Houston at a dinner table. Oh, pro locker. 10 power triple. That's never come out of Angola. There he is. Oh, I would be watching him mark Williams, Lamellaball and Terry Rogier. My have things to change. Hey, man. Look at the style. Boom for Traylen. Hornets get it back. No damage done. They lead by one. One. Brand new. Good. Good. Position to be successful. It's only going to get better folks as these guys can come to the other. On Nietzsche. Yeah, both knees. Johnson. Uh oh. Hornets. Totally lost track of Jaylen Johnson. Hornets led 23 to 12. One point. Hunter. And Atlanta takes the lead. It's now made 11 consecutive shots dating back to Monday's game against Indiana Pacers. Three young up in Atlanta. Three Richards Williams, Miller and Man playing together. This is Man. He has made three three pointers in our ballgame. Locked by Johnson. Hornets lead by three. Hornets lead by one. Johnson's had a good first half. Two Matthews and Bruno Fernando. Slip screen. Punched by Jaylen Johnson. As a stale cleaner from Iowa's Britain. Oh my goodness. It was stolen away by Murray. That was a low scoring game. It's like this in the end. Dobby Burkin. Hornets had to basketball in two point lead. Miller. And Matt Juss from a rugby. Shot clocked out of five. Oh, Cody Martin. Take a salad. Wow. That's one going anywhere very fast. Young step back. Great. He is just the best. The great Mookie playlock for most threes in the history of Atlanta Hall. Murray catching shoot. And we're tied in 46. Brandon Miller's got nine points. And he's fouled by Murray. We're not going to give him continuation. There's 54 games. Atlanta's played 55. Brandon Miller. Oh, I don't realize you can't leave him up. You can't leave him up. Murray has Burtons in front of him. And a late whistle. And again, Murray, a chance for a three point play. Learned that a profit of the day. Charger. Elbow jumper. Brandon Miller. Still with it. I'm straight. And then even though he's good fouled. Three young gets an offense. I've rebounded. And he misses. Atlanta had three cracks at it and miss them all. Hornets are getting a one crack. And I think it's a two handed flush by Brandon. Brandon Miller weaves his way around Johnson. Iskik, it's Skull. Tray. Goodness. Good to try. Hornets lead by 13. High watermarked in our ballgame. He has been kept in check. Oh, Jalen Johnson has not been held in check. Tray man. Working to get Tray Young. Go catch by Nick Richard. Oh, there's this one man. He just could see the pressure on the rim. I'm denied. As soon as he got the help, the rapper round pass. The big. He's going to be. Bay. Bay's only shooting 31. He's remaining third quarter. Curry in the corner. Oh, man. Get a look. That was because that's a result. Oh, my goodness. Two guys. Horn in Charlotte hospital. Take back to back three. Curry's got the ball. Give the two. Classic Curry from 18. Shot clocked out of four. City Bay. All Hawks play. Mejit. Uses that professional body man. Oh, that was a foul. He's going to win for a third consecutive game. Curry. You won the longest streak of games played with a three made in the NBA. The Andre Hunter. A chase down block by Miller. That's starting to become his thing. Shot clocked out of five. Three. One, two. I'm going to throw the triple shoot in the game against the Hornet. Trey Young. High scoop shot. Hornets have been stuck at the set, remarked for a while. There he goes. There it is. Second dunk of the night. Pretty dangerous. Brandon keeps his dribble alive. This guy will stay with us at the Hornets to get this win tonight and then win one more. And the pig stays in Charlotte. Let's do it. Miles Brackett. Big suede. City Bay. That's a touch of hands. That shoots it. About shoulder level. Mejit gets it. Finish it with a lap pan. And the local. And with the left handbrain lawyer. And delivers the blow. I'm going to back to that game. Big challenge. And the Hornets lead. Brandon Miller, 26 points. Finds Mejit. With to not the bridges. Oh my god. With just well. The Hornets mastery over him somehow continues. Kobe Bucking. Yes, he's named for Kobe Bryant. Got to miss you. Cast up. And everybody can't put a profit. It's day. Tell me what. I mean, say you want a beat Memphis in the Anna good team. Show it off. It's probably ever any team in the history of the NBA. Just a radical 180 from what we've gone to. What we're looking at right now. This one of things is so much fun. And really good right now. And you hold it. And you hold it. And you hold it. And you hold it. And you hold it. And you hold it. And you hold it. And you hold it. And you hold it. And you hold it. And you hold it. And you hold it.
