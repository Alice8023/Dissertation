 You ready? You game? I'm game. I like it. Tire him out. Bobo wins the tip. And we are underway on a Friday night. Here it's out feeling. Now it's right now. Fifth in the West. 37 and 25. Zion. Up and down it goes. Favours left hook and go either way. Here's Kelly Ubrae. And looked sensational for the sixers. Last three games off the bench. And a nice start there. A nice deep end by the sixers. Not to pal. It shows you how much space Zion get carved out. Even in traffic. Quick trigger from Kelly Ubrae, Jr. And he goes. Ubrae with all five of the sixers points. That's fine. Valentina sway underneath. That's too easy for the big fella for New Orleans. Two days off at this point. And the season. It's only played. This is their third game of the month. Little bit jealous. In group from outside. We'll call a Blake in there. Look at this guy. And Zion. Once again. You mentioned it. In group 12 points. Six assists, three rebounds in that win over Toronto. And an impressive play right there. In group spinning, hanging and hitting. Soaring in for the rebound. Five, four, seven from three in that Brooklyn Mall. Fourteen points. He's playing. Good catch. And decision back to bias Harris. No. Paul re-enacted to Tobias and Harris. Lies it up in there. Only sixer to play in every game this season. He is Paul Reef. The defense there. Tied up Zion. Made him give it up. And CJ gets the roll. Pinballing around in the paint. And McCullum comes away with it. Can't fault the hustle though. Great work. And McCullum. The crossover. And the ball. And the lefty scoop in the score for CJ and McCullum. That was the one all approved of the most. If we're, you know, waiting in the ranking post. Now, as he marshals, swishes the three. Six assists went to a two-three zone. Anger wants it, buddy on him. He comes right down the lane. Tissue, nants from the corner. And Larry Nance rattles in a second consecutive three for the visiting pelicans. All really into the lane. Leave the shot short. Really need some easy buckets here. The sixers do. Long three rattles in by ULs. Marshall. Alvarado from the corner. And another three goes. The exception of valid shooters for Nance Jr. They really aren't that big. Yes, they got Zion. They're really not that big. Three mounds are available. Marshall with a long two foot on the line. And that only has been the story for the pelicans last three four seasons. So it is good to see them finally healthy and performing. So what their fans and a lot of folks were hoping they'd see from them. And he looks like he comes from a John Wick movie. But he is one of the nicest big dudes you will meet. Great pass from UL Bray to Mo Bamba. Kelly. Nice little two-man game there. See if the sixers can kind of build off of that. Marshall from three. Freeze continuing to fall off of the pelts. Effort. It's time to our counterparts again from New Orleans before the game. And said this guy has played so well the last couple of games. And it's worth pointing out he often gets to share the floor. That's not that fine. And that's not so way by Williamson. But it gets the back. Gotta get it up. And Zion there for the block. One for 15 from outside. Murphy off front iron. Good contest by Maui. Buddy looking at the coach to coach. And things are going to go to peace in that one as well. He's almost 44% helping out in the NBA offices. Up next night is Murphy again. And those premier night times. And made freeze. The boot down of Toronto on Tuesday. Paul Reed. A couple of Pelicans defenders. McCallum. Over the shoulder catch and push. And McCallum right to the cup. Nobody stepped in front. Maui trying to slow down in. Grub. Pesa. Into the paint. And gets a very friendly roll. And he let up whatsoever. Oh, the board got 25 bench points. Yep. If you can count to the 4th takes the dribble. That's the jumper. Right now, if you're the 6ers, you go in and you talk things over. And you come out here and you hope for a strong response at 3rd quarter. Speaking of strong Zion, Williamson all the way to the cup. The way that this considerable margin. Williamson drops it off to Valentius. From strokes another 3. Harris takes the 3. DRIMS. Dishes. Deals. Off the bounce. Kyle catching 2-3. And let's get offense from the 6ers. Okay. Got a stop. Got a 3. I'm calling for the bluff. But he looks from 3. And everybody hits. And Willa Green calls time. He's really going into his body and hopefully draws some attention. Shot clock winding down. Once again, it's a bias. It's this time. Not the elbow jay. Don't save yourself. It doesn't matter anymore. And Willa's spinning, hanging, and hitting a tough shot. I couldn't sprint in England. The England gets the ball and he's able to just navigate somewhere on the floor. And gets a nice soft shot off. And he's able to get a nice batting baseline. Harris picks up the loose change. He lays it up and in and draws the foul. Brande thefts Alvarado. And Mo Balba, the good chase down block. And I don't think he expected Mo to be anywhere near that place. Oh, great. All the way to the top on the other end. Stop. Lion lost. Wow. Not it back and laid it up and in. I'm glad. I'm glad he advised Zion Williamson. Whatever works for you, right? The idea is to be comfortable out there on the floor. And if you got to continue with a little bit of sweat around the forehead, that's what you do. Marshall, through the contact, somehow able to power that one up and in. Made that really difficult to leap forward and pick up that pass. Final minute 28 of the third. And this time it's Zion. Look at the floor spaces, the palakins. All the way on the sideline Murphy. Pain. Paul Reade? Yeah. Go for it Paul. Go for it Paul. Good fake and finish from Paul Reade. First team foul. In this fourth quarter. So we tried to post up Alvarado. Just couldn't get it to him. Oh, great move by Paul Reade off the campaign. But think about when Joelle and Tyrese and Anthony are back. And Balochuis goes up and over Reade. That's why he's got one of the best nicknames in sports. Right? Marshall shutting his defender. Probably very offended that he missed the last shot trying to redeem himself. Look at that. And what a move by Campey. Around the big man and put some sugar on that reverse. Against the zone. There are any rebounding assignments per se. So you've got to go and find a guy. Pain attacking the glass. Drawing the foul. I'd say he and Jason T. are the most offensively gifted guys they ever go to do. Police drive by Paul. Truck it it off to Ubrae who it's the bucket and draws the foul. This one is not done yet. Devise downhill. Believe in the 10. It's the good game. Now take advantage. Get a great shot. Kelly Ubrae. Wow. Wow. Wow. Oh my goodness. Caught up in the play. He was able to stop it. Wow. Third block for Williamson. In from. That sweet stroke from Mirage. That's a great 24 performance from Kelly Ubrae. Junior on that. Now you break a press right there. Well done by the pals and ants. Don't sit down. Try to go quick. Devise does. Up and down it goes. From 30 bothersome. Zion Williamson up and in. Wow. Let him take this shot. Now you got to make at least a contestant. Look, that's the problem. There's no open looks. An incredible second half. Effort for your sixers. Well unfortunately results. And a third consecutive loss. As the pelicans survive a late push here in South Philly. Thank you.
