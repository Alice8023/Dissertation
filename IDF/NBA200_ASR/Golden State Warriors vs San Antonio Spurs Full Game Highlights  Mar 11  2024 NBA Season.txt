 You ready? You game? I'm game. I'm the one who's the top. I'm the one who's the top. And then on to Dallas and finish his up in LA. And this first, they made all the threes the other night. They opened with a three and it's Vicell that hits it. Minga had 26 and that game saturday. The elbow jumper is perfect. He's off to a great start in this game. Last time it was in the second half. He's like, I only get started early. You could use a game from Wiggins. And then Yama, eight foot wingspin. Putting that up in the end. That's what happened. And then Yama flipping that up and in. That's the size. You got played Thompson on small defendants. Oh, Minga! That's after a made basket. My goodness. And that is the JK we saw in the second half on Saturday. Here comes Minga again. Running with Clay, sets his feet and drops in the three. Champenny. Rousehold look three. Wiggins, Wiggins, Wiggins looks locked in offensively. And Wiggins is just taking command right now. Wiggins is three of three. We called for that last game. Nice finish on the roll. Fair challenge is super solid in how he delivers to the big guys. Fitch Fski with the wing three. And the Warriors designed that out of the timeout. Jemski hides behind Trace. It's another three. Wesley went behind that screen too. As well as he's playing as a rookie. He gets his three ball goal. Watch out. Come on, Mount Seven. And Vicell has been amazing. And Minga, just work on TJD. Just serves it up with a left hand. Yeah, without step. Where do you go offensively? They're going Chris Paul, Trace Jackson Davis. You said it. Gonna stay with him on that. But he just kind of faked that and got back to Trace Jackson Davis. Well, then Johnson. Minga had three. Chris Paul's been hot too. I don't three seconds. Chris Paul to end the quarter. He's gonna stuck him out of mat. He is four or four. Wimbenyaba with the steal and the finish. Here's Tori and William looking back. You have not won a game without Steph Curry this year. But the way guys are playing Andrew Wiggins. He's had a whole different mindset tonight. Chris Hamiltonia was shooting in the first quarter. Every open shot. He expected to go in. Chris Paul finished with the Warriors last eight to end the first. He's got 11 and he hasn't missed a shot. The lob. And that is a high percentage shot for TJD. Nick Wesley set up Barlow inside. It is getting wild and physical. And Carlton Johnson, the most physical, laying it up and in. I cock it five. Wiggins has nowhere to go with it. And the Warriors bailed out again. And look to the man where the help came from. He's on the glass. He just follows it up. Camingo with a three. And the dubs have come from 11 down the tie in. I think so, huh? Good help from play on the baseline. But he stepped through around Wiggins to put it up and in. That is immaculate footwork. Hey, Mod goes back at Zach Collins, Mr. but quickest fan of the ball for the Warriors second chance points. It's tough shot. Play Thompson. Missing their pitch-ups key. Three spurs and he took it away. And the claim re-loved three. And that was a more rhythm shot. Clay could shoot over trade Jones. Instead, Raymont sent a scream. So he could get to the rim. And then, Jonio, his house on fire at the beginning. And Jim Cunning is not pulled off. Two bottoms of three. Champ penny. Bottoms another three. Ray Jones is straight line drive. And then lay it up and in. He had one field goal on Saturday. Raymont will relocate it play. And his three is perfect. So it's Chris Ball and play working together. Ray Jones floater. So look at his own office. Wiggins attacking. Ray Jackson Davis following it home. And called the backboard pass. And then, when Benyama was behind him. Well, he's always going to be around the boards. Use that bounce. And Benyama for three. And Wins in home. This feels made three of the night. So, Jonio pushed it back. And never took the foot out the accelerator. And he'll lay it up and out. No, it's not the ball really. The Warriors desperately need someone to get hot. The cell, Pogo sticks in with three. This fourth made three. And Steve Kerr's got to use the timeout. And Clay Thompson right on cue. Dropping in the jumper. That's been a great rebounding team all year. Chris Ball. Chris Ball is coming off that thing right as score. And Benyama very deep position. Ooh. It's stopping in there. Let by two and a half, first three minutes. Spurs have come out with energy. Caminga three. So the Warriors have started to impromptage. And deep position. And then, Raymont able to knock it away with Chris Ball from Sohan and Clay Thompson speeding into lay it in. It starts with getting stops. Then you can throw it ahead. Clay's got 16. Ray Jones, what a finish. And Benyama trying to go right back at him. And Bully's him into the lane and we put it in. Just wouldn't take a no-born answer. Caminga with the big step. And that is Glow-attended. Smarterly took it off the backboard. Clay split two defenders couldn't get to the rim. Hey. The Jamsky. They'll bank it home and draw the foul. And the adjustment there. Trace Jackson Davis. Put Sohan in the bucket. For Jamsky, I have a step through. Floats it up and out. Wiggins is there. Trace Jackson Davis looking for Wiggins. And it's an open wing three. And it's perfect. Good patience that time. Here's Paul Lodge. TJD. See, Paul didn't know what to do there. His crowd is nervous. High screen roll again. The body, the bump, the buckets. Words of play with that sense of urgency. Elvin Johnson finally ends that streak. San Antonio, this seven straight shots. Jamsky flipping it up and in before Collins could get to. Moody hustling. And Binyama. That was amazing. Ranimals put it on the deck and Moody sends him away. Moses wasn't playing. Chris Paul put Jamsky with a left hand. It wasn't called Glow-attended. Lucas Chris Paul laid it up and in. Wesley Floder. Minyana, the pocket pass of Ranim got to the rim. Calded Johnson throwing inside to Minyama. He's able to flip that home. Jamsky kind of weaving through traffic. It comes coming into the mid range. Perfectly done. Alkiy Branagh has been wonderful since the All-Star break. You got three straight 20 point games. And Clay Thompson hitting a three. Play sound. I'll tell you all, Minyama. You're backing up. I'm letting fly. Clay Thompson. I'm relaxed when he's hitting jumpers. Okay? Clay is playing relaxed. Minyama. That was almost three. So he got twenty and twelve. Minyama with the handle. Back out to Calded Johnson for three. And this first time going away. GP2 to Dremel. Take the big man and pass him round him. Minyama steps out to the three. That's what I said. He's not going to be a 33% three point shooter for much longer. There's Paul top of the key jumper. This Paul has been wonderful tonight. He stepped up. There's Paul occupying the big man. I had to step around him. Oh, Kamehameh! I see an open lane. I'm sorry. And this plus that was so nice. The sell was $13. Cloning was left. Actual 8 point game from three point ringer. This Paul, who is sweet spot. CP3's got 19. Ray Jones. If you saw Trace Jackson, Davis, father, him built the rebound for the sows. That Collins got it again. Trace took it away. That's great time. Place brings free. Little double clutch shot. Shot it flat. The lob to Wimbledon. He's fouled. As he got it, that was special. That's that 97 standing reach. Wimbledon, a lot of block. Backouts at Chris Puffal. One more bucket or one more stop. Trace Jackson, Davis. Oh! He blew the entire country of fangs. In the basket. Take that A for Wigsman with you. That is his welcome to the lead moment. Dumped on by another rookie. That is insane. He went for the steal. And that's what set him up. And Trace Jackson, Davis just finished him. They felt that in Leon. In the side. In Paris. In Burgundy. Oh, man. This was a heck of an NBA game. Tell me they're building for next season.
