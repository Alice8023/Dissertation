 You ready? You game? I'm game. Who else can support with some offense as well? Mixed on off the night, 34 and 23, 19 and 9 at home. But they're just fixing out in the corner. Josh Hart off the bounce. Well, not close picked up by a chew up lay up his skull. He seems to be running the fuck it all the time. Ivy kicks it out, cutting in, launches the three-pointer. That's good. Well, the first time these two teams played, the next rough by one after the first, it was tied at halftime and they trailed after three. Oh, one of the move, Brunson. He's got a smurbing across the lane and floats it up and in. Hydra picked last season, made all rookie second team. Drives on off the side and a floaters up comes up short. Another given after. Even Chenzo drives it side, beautiful move from Dictator to Chenzo. Start to step it up and bring it at a different level as the pistons came into this game, ready to fight. They schooled there from Cunningham. The twins, they're really good defenders. Yep, great length, great athleticism. It's the shot making. What a pass Cunningham inside to Wiseman. And the pistons back up by one. Hard catches, drives inside, nice adjustment, but in and out, one goes, sends the rebound and trapping. Alex Brooks is first shot on the night as well. That's good to see. Struggling with his three-ball against the Celtics, trying to get it down to Wiseman. Saved it, but right to Brooks. Into the hands of Brunson. Brooks. Shot is gone, am a foul. Brooks felt the contact through it out of the ram and a chance for a three-point one. As a shot block has turned off. Flynn crossover, gruesome contact. Cunning Williams upset, nice move from Flynn. Not if it's kind of looking super easy to go. Not if it's behind the arc, next down to three. Brimes tries again. That one in and out. Hard in the rebound, but done a bit ahead of the pack was inside. That's eight already. Tassenside, Park against Malachi. Flynn, trying to post up, gets the bounce. Tracey Morgan loves to see that too. And credit to Tracey Morgan, those comedians, the Garden of Dreams. So important, what's nice to do for 48, hosted by our good buddy Steve Shrippa. They want a surround cutting am with outside shooting. That's not Ivy's strength of the least much in crew. He cried. Hard out of the arc, he shot. Who's that one in? Shot block at five. Brooks' open heart doesn't see him. Hard in the side, thought about a three. Heart does shoot a three. They have goals. As his shot block expires. Fun Tecchio just waiting there in the corner. Next down the room. He's been shooting lights out since they got him. McBride up top. A lot of it strives down. Feeds hardstie for the staff. Run's in goes that Fontecchio drives inside. Tried to draw foul. He got hit the face. Coming out quickly the other way. pass inside and here in the first half cutting in. Lobster, Durham throws it down. That's the fourth assist for cutting in. David Chenzone, no hesitation. Sims is fourth offensive rebound off the bench. Brunson finds room and gets inside. Canada in one. Not gonna miss that lap in a chance for a three-point blow. Thompson gets up into Brunson. Brunson back out hard. Long three-pointer. Got it. Nineteer three-pointer in the first half. Bitechia rattles in the frame with 2.7 minutes. Brunson trying to find some space six on the shot block. Bines deep in Chenzone's own cutting, lapping banks of end. 5.7 to 14 in the first half before that miss. I'm Stein. Sims gets inside. I don't think he wants to shoot it. He was a whirl in derfession there. Next back up double figures. Cunningham finds his room and finally sinks it. Now 7.7 from the field. Deflicted it. Deep in Chenzone fires away. Misses Durham with the rebound. Savage in slow-per-game. Cunningham. Long stride. Lays it up and in. Shot block at 7. Brunson up top. Deep in Chenzone. Three-pointer's good. There's the rumble-boat game where that's what's on the middle of the goal. There's no hesitation. Simulta. Character of six. Harvest time went down. Harp. He thought he was fouled. Ivy leading the break. Ivy goes hard at Josh. Harp. Whampers good. And a blocking foul called on Harp. This is these dangerous games when you let the team hang around. Brunson. Three-pointer's good. Chenzone runs on his third three-game and he's got 23 points. Durant kicks it back out. Montecchio. Hard stays with him. Nice adjustment. Banks at home. From the middle of the wildcats. Durant. And knocked away. Shot clock at 4. Cunningham. Left open. Nails the three-pointer. Top two but are not happy with Jalen Brunson. We got out there late. The Jericho swims as athletic ability is really stuck to show through. His energy is great. Cunningham creates some space and nails the three-pointer. Two of double figures and boards again. Montenobots runs into four-knit and they say play on. Montenobots knocked down the shot. He's got ten. That again. Nice entry past a wiseman. Easily lays it in. Why do former Nicks change wiseman? Flin kicks it out to Grimes Grimes. Knocks down the three. His first points. And it's a five-point game. Flynn looking, Birch fights over the screen. Flynn the crossover gets inside. Running land. What a move from Malikite. Flynn. Nicks lead cuts a three. This is his effort. Hard jump shot. It's good. Josh Hart now with 19. Retreats. It's ready to go. Five on the shot clock. It's into the paint. Stop. Kicks it out four-knit. Up top Grimes. Quick release. Knocks down the three. Brunson's got 31. Cunning each other right now. Then I had him looking to post. Even Chenzel helps out. Four-knit finds it open. Spot hits the three. It's a two-point game. And it's been the former Nicks that have made a difference in this quarter. And that includes Flynn. A lot of it's waiting for Fires Kicks. Led by that man Cunningham. He's had some help here in the fourth quarter from the bench, including Grimes. Grimes drives. Feed inside. Durant gathers and backs it in. Cross-coarched. Staling by deep and Chenzel. A hit to Brunson. Brunson drives. Back out deep and Chenzel. Three-punner. BAM! Cunningham. Tuck you into Cunningham. Thought about the three. Chenzel goes inside. Archstein closes. Grimes. Three-punners up. Chatzgud. Cunning Grimes gives the pistons. Their first leads as the first quarter. Six to shoot. Park gets inside. The floaters up. Shot no good. Repon. A chiller lays it up and in. No time. That's inside. Shot put one goal. Deep and Chenzel will rebound. A hit to Brunson. Brunson drives inside. Stops. Hesitation. Bucks in. Cunningham. Suddenly cold. Not making a shot. Frustrated with himself. Brunson, the hesitation. Jump shot. Bucks in. 35 for Brunson. Next back up by four. Deep and Chenzel shuts them off. Grimes gets it back. Up top to Cunningham. Ticks it out. The corner. Chaps in a three. That's good. Cunningham. He's getting chased. Up top from Tekkiow. Extra pass to Grimes. Shot clock at six. Grimes off the bounce. Running lay-up. As come. Not a shot from Grimes. 14 points here. In the fourth quarter. In the Preston's lead by one. 10 seconds, Goliath. Brunson away. Ball moves picked up by Brunson. Brunson inside the heart. Heart strikes it in. Perfect. Next take the lead. Lonnie Williams is furious. And it's a theory. And it stayed with the play. Runs the Nabila, pick it up and find the assist to Josh Hart. And this one's huge. Obviously to make it a three-point game. All right. This is another ball, bad and loose. All right, picks it up the game's over.
