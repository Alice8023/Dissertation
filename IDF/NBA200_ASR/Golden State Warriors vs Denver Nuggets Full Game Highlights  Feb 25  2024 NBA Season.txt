 We'll get one to one. You ready? You game? I'm game. I'm game. Start those kids young. I love it. Get them into Chase Center. Ordin' inside. Midi product always likes playing against his hometown team. Grandmaster, Randall and Therese. Better than 53% in the first quarter. The Kamenka League. Take care of the high records. Now this is a start you're looking for. Run them. They don't really want to run with you. They're a slow-paced team as Michael Porter Jr. knocks down a three. Michael Porter Jr. You just got an idea of how Yokech can hand off set of screen and they have snipers. Maybe it's just that hot as a blade. And Rude. It was his birthday Friday. It's Pajewski's birthday to death. Tries inside on Gordon. Clear aside for Yokech. And you just see the big man. He's a great passer at a triple double the other night. Wiggins adjusted a minute here to finish that. Wiggins is not him. Finding Pajewski occupying Yokech. It's what you were calling for along with. You single cover him is a question too. Because he can do that. And it averages 26, 12 and 9. Right top and side step three. Beautiful. Flamed with the side step just to get a little more time. It was so perfectly done. Michael Porter Jr. You just can't leave him. One of those can't leave him at all. A GP2 again. They're an opportunity. Flare on a warm up three. You got it. We'll need to take a turn on Yokech. Spin for a round of measures that good. Slippery. Right top and center. Gatch of two three. He's got 11. Yokech for three. Yokech. And a 35%. Wiggins, I'm wrenching Jackson. Wiggins. It's all over him. Jackson was like, oh, nice to do up. And Wiggins like, yeah, but I'll just turn it back in anyway. Flare on. Hot Am I. 14 points in six minutes. Wiggins get me down the hill around Yokech to lay. One of nice footage Andrew Wiggins. I love that so much because again, you're involving Yokech and pick up rolls and he got down hill. Yokech is mad about it, obviously, because he's running the floor like a maniac. That's what I just keeps you. He thought about reloading and then said, I've got 16 now. And then the long pass to KCB. And that is just brilliant. And call the Yokech. Play Thompson. That'll end now. Trace Act to Davis. High for that rebound. Rebeck is around. No man. Play good hands to Sharers. It's vision from play that Trace Jackson day was when he comes in the game. Great things happen. Throw the top to Trace. Play Thompson again. 21 of the first half. Murray with the midi got it. Jackson Davis on the block working against Porter Jr. Right over the top of the buckets. Murray hunting Pajewansky defensively. Trots the dive. Not to keep up block by Jackson Davis. At the other injection Davis. He catalyzed that 94 feet. Murray inside with a little jelly left hand. He's got six on the drive by Thompson. Got it working off the bounce to. The minga with an open lane and a one way. Murray rejects the Joker screen, pulls up and gets a fortuitous roll for the bucket. Jamal Murray starting to percolate a little bit. He's up to eight points. And Jonas. Murray for free. Murray for free. And how Jamal Murray did not make the Western conference all-star team. It's a little bit perplexing. A minga in transition. And get a vacuum on the repost. Boy, as he slowed things down, Stephanie. Curry on the rip through. Trots the dive to three. Everybody got a tough. Joker on the pick and a hot. Remember, it was that 39 footer at the buzzer that won the last meeting. Wiggins in pursuit. Tough shot by Jamal. It did a victory lap and finally fell. He's quickly up to 15. Quick post up and rim roll by Gordon. And one. Murray for free. Got it. All Murray percolated. Wiggins inside. But Jamal Murray. Jamal's yet spoke to Steve Curry. He said, basically, look, we got to do what we did for, you know, the first 20 some-admitted of the game. Porter Jr. off the curl. Back to Yokehch. Tries one from outside of Carrom's arm. To Gordon. Back to Joker. Who lays it home. Make a one-on-one against Yokehch. Light work for Nicole Yokehch. He's a tough shot maker. Bulls butter. And a quick time out by Steve Curry. Aaron Gordon going to try and bully Pominga now turns around. And Banks won home. Yokehch with the outlet to call well pulled. Bulls the great guy. Here's Green. Joker really laying off from Curry with a lane. Time out Denver. Yokehch inside. Big body bends move. Joker with the jump hook. He's got 24. Jotzi, I was checking it on the Warriors. Huddled just a bolt in a go. I said, Curry gets free from the fair. And then defensively the stress from the coaching staff will make sure that they defended transition. Jotzi, I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Curry over Yokehch for three. We knew it was a matter of time. Kenonius got it. And we're tied in 82. Jackson for three. And he laces that one. Thompson for three. That's about the easiest look he's had. Brown in transition. I mean, coming a climb to a ladder but couldn't get to it. And Brown lays at home to give them a four point lead. Amingo with a slick left hand and finish. And that's what he's got to do, right? Wiggins for three. Wiggins for three. Thompson had a good look. He's cooled off a little bit since that torrent start. Aaron Gordon puts Sarrich in the wake room. That's simple. Sarrich. One more. James Jackson, Davis. Gordon to corner Junior on the drive. Goes quickly with it and scores it. Curry leads the lead in clutch time scoring great read defensively by Jokehur to make the interception and the lob to Najee. Hold well, up to three. Got it. Green is side with the easy lead. And those two guys have a unseen connection. Not the steel. Come back on the fly. But Najee ball on the bounds and a stay warrior's fall. There's that action they like to run with Murray and Jokehur. One more to a wide open ground. Catch out. Curry with the giant slayer. Jokehjins side with the scoop shot. He's up to 26. There's that two-man game that is so difficult to stop. Gordon Junior raises up on the midi. And Jokehjins tips it home. There's the size advantage. Green and six. One more to a coming coming up for one. And one. Little touch action. Murray gets it back from Jokehj. Shot clock down to three. Murray. The master of the midi. Jamal Murray with 27 and another clutch bucket by his. A double team. Murray. The floppin out of the dunker spot. Aaron Gordon. Skying high for 17 points to make it 117-103. Meanwhile, the Golden State Warriors are going to look at a 29 and 27 record at the conclusion of this one. Including 16 and 15 at home. They have played many more games at home than they have on the road. So, there's somewhat perilous imbalance. You
