 We'll get one more. You ready? You game? I'm game. Against the Phoenix. In the victim. Overgreen. Off the window and good. Well, they were trying to get it to him right off the bat. Now, Dushin grew against Victor. He backs down and is rejected on the jump hook. That's what I said. He's going to hit him with it. Oh, mama. One man, Yama. Is he feeling the difference? Man, believe, knocks down the jumper. Jones up into the bucket for the ramp. So, man, with the two hand dunk and a nice shovel feed from the cell. Man, believe, another flipple. He's a good against Shempenne. Now, he's going to need some help here. Aish! Out of five, the third picture becomes with the health defense. Bambley, he quickly gives to David Green. He attacks this time, blows right off of his third card. Just low to different to sleep there, puts on a little bit of a burst. Go! Shempenne. Two. Seeklake, Britain, whipping down. Oh, how about that great fine at the cell with the flops? Eyes it up in 13. Stingoon literally just blows it off the glass. Yeah, good. Inside Collins. Got his own up to the left, got a plot. He's team to go here, first quarter. Green off the screen from Shempenne. Groom, rattles in the three. Bambley. Over Collins. Nothing but the bottom. Tough start there from Patrick Green. Here's Bambley. Three on one. Pick your man and green with the dunk. Double team on pick. Westleaf, back around. Brand of knocks it down, a Malachi. There's really been contributing of late. Inside. Remind where the dunk. It was just kind of sicker. On the drive, plot number two. Westleaf, trying to create some space. Keldon. And lays it up in Thompson to Landale for three. Oh, fuck. I'm mentioning, one two and more. Looking down. Victor, no hesitation. Why not? When you can shoot it like that. Feed up. Wounds the crowd. Chengue, the flat foot of the one handed. Hop to shot. It's good. Three challenges in the side of Moons this one. Goatty two, 31. Rockett. Johnson. Swishes the three. He has Keldon Johnson. Find him some success from the outside. He's going to knock it down. So we're going to force him to take that shot. Green. Rockett's got a pair of 36-34. And lead deep three. Touch past of the sound. And an easy two. It's unbelievable. Touch there. Gede Osman. Nobody's stopping him. It goes to the top for Linda. Maybe Green. An easy layup. Time out first. And we'll just... Two times in a row. We'll just get too much of a hurry. We'll call him over to the place. Green is able to finish on this one. Granum. You're running floater. Collins backs off of Chengue. Patience with the fade away. And lead. Back to the big fella. And Alphie. Backstab. And he knows all the angles that are here. Collins. Got the corner jumper. And it is a three. Keldin Johnson. There's got numbers for the moment. The cell stops at the three-point line. And knocks down the triple. And remember, she almost not allowed to shoot three. That was just kind of the same. I'm just going to start his career. That's just super serious. That's the bracket. You have to be correct that. So hand. Oh, then Alphie. Oh, she dunks it. I like to finish even better. Chengue, the poppish up. Oh, my shit. Chengue. What? Oh, second one is a foul. There's a game with a turn over. I was too talked about the Rockets again. Much more together. Oh, he's got to win. Green. Green. And the Rockets. Back on top. Seven straight for the Rockets. So hand. Knocks down the three. Green. And Green gets by picture again. Green. Green. And the I10 Rivals going out again. Green again. Only five on the shot clock. The cell. Block. Got a pack. Yeah, it's almost a impossible shot there. Jones trying to outrace everybody. The cell inside the paint for two more. Devon realizing. Got to take the scoring low. With the cap. Green. Green. Green. Back to so hand. And he's going to hang on the score. Oh, tricky pass there by Keltin. Green. Green. First, the foul didn't want to start. It's got to break. Brandy. Big three for Malachi, brandy. Man, bleep. Loose for three. Green. America won't tell me that. And then, the rich man will just stop from a setup. From Brandy. Brandy, man of life. juggling and to slip some chasing Brown. He slips and falls. Now he's got a guy scoring. Now there you go again. Back out, Brannum. Yes, Sire! Oh, mama! Rockets the other way. The scoop, no. Going back up. He's scoring his Whitmore. Look like he lost it there. Brick control. Inside. And getting an over-picture. Well, me and Whitmore again. Against Oscar. Underneath. And then the Dunpot land. Brannum. Got it to roll. Malacate. Rock out. We'll post up game now. He got 17. Rockets control the glass. And Whitmore another two. And Lee. Red Van Blieff. And I'll switch it to a state. Johnson. Swiss for three. Midrange jumper comes off to Kelden. I head to Devin Vassal. Oh, nice finger roll away. Not easy. Oh, he took the angle. Double team comes. And the turn over. Green the other way. Blocked against Shengoon. Bitter comes away with it. That's a good block. On the bounce. I head to Shetty. And he scores. Van Blieff. Back out. Shengoon takes the three. And then you got it going on. You got it going on. With the Rockets. Hook us around. Bitter. And you dump the other way. We'll bring about as far as time out. Devin Vassal. Under pressure. Knucks that one down. You're Shengoon underneath. And dumps on Bitter. And sell the miss. Watch out. Whitmore. Their defense has been phenomenal. Brandon. Knucks down the three. Shengoon blocked out the turn. Van V, the Shengoon. Over Bitter. Van Blieff hits the midrange. Shengoon. A little three a moment ago. It was right into Victor again. Van Blieff back to Shengoon. You took the three. And on. A Kareena. And all goes for him. 114. Thank you.
