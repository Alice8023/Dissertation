 You ready? You game? I'm game. Buchevich and Jalen Durin, young talented center, wins the tap for Detroit Caruso right in Kate Cunningham's grill. Jalen Durin, young group, as we said, one of them was against youth early in the season. You can't take anybody lightly. They still go to the back. Back to back, heart breaking losses to the magic and nicks for Detroit. They lost six straight cutting hand with his second bucket. Doesn't matter who he's playing, whether it's a big or small, you can play him all. Just saw KC's, the weed about it. There's Buchevich again, at times at a six. He does a good job on Kate Cunningham, takes it personally. Okay, speed and transition, Ivy to Thompson for the jam. This is where they want to play out. Nice save by Cunningham, as Stuart just launched into the corner. Ivy gets down fast and finds a cutter. What do you know? There's a star Thompson again. Ivy. Nice speed inside for Wiseman. Wait, Jalen Ivy's doing some good things as a ball handler. Wolves are cross-matched. Bontequio's open and he hits the three. Oh, Bontequio's going to use the range. He's been shooting 36%. Wolves looked for their first lead. DeRose had to give it to him a lot too. He gave it to Bontequio. He gave a little shove. And then take that wiki. Brij picks up DeRose. It's away from the double scorer's up. DeRose final year. Good job. Nice pass. Very good pass, PT. He finds Drum and he put the little binoculars. Wolves got 11-0 run right now. That ends the run. Like shot by Malachi, Flynn. I just gave him. You guys got the defense. I mean, that's what's going on. He gets the ball with their roll. Big first corner for DeRose and continues. He's to eight. You've got a foul trouble by the pins. Big turn them. Yeah. He points goes down for Flynn. Back to back buckets for Malachi. I thought he could play. Baruso takes the clock down to five. Goes to work. Clips to B. No, Mr. Drummond. DeRose and Guchavitch had drummed at 25 to 29 points. And don't hold the clubbell. Free cheese. You get to not play together against New Orleans. You're getting more runs tonight. You're taking advantage. DeRose and yes. DeRose is the fender you get lost. And involved your game even further, which has been such a great story for White this season. Oh, look at that. Now, let's do so. Does it again? Here he comes. Oh, look at that. How can you not play hard if you're not on Alex Dean? The season plays so hard looking right there. Oh, Duret. Took it all the way. He made the executive decision at that time. There's a little drive to the sporting challenge. That time, I'm Duret. The drum was there. It may have been offensive basket interference. It may have been number three on Big Tolo. That time, Peruso just reached down a little bit in a chance at a three-point play. White to the game. Same thing. Same person. With guards out on the floor, and they've got two big guys out there. It opens up. Rookie team selection last season. Second team. White got to go a tough spot. Turn over. Look at the speed. Wow. The pistons moved. Those are over 10 from three. They're 20 of 27 from two-point range. Nice slip pad. They double-cade. And he just waited for Guren. Foggy-Raw. Foggy-Raw. Is he going to be here? He's just hanging out. That's his hand. Good job, man. Peruso's three-point. They're 12 attempts. White. Kick. I-O goes Subaru, no. Rebound Thompson. Watch out. Right to Ivy. Nice scoop. They've get down the floor. With loose ball to do a Subaru. Shot clocked down to two. Deros it. Yes, sir. Tomorrow is deros it. Seven of eight and three for three for the free-crow line. We're going to say what? The trojan we have to write down. Boy, they have time. Three for Miss Vitable. We'll keep them in the game. And cutting hand with a big three. One on every court. He is 10 for his last 11. That's a free-crow line. Five. Five. Five. I-O-Dosubo. Boy, he's like an auto-bond. That's how he just blew right by. Dad and grandfather won't play to the national football league. And the Democratic really athletic family that JNNB comes for. There's Deros it. Who continues his very efficient night. He's going to play. He's going to play. Sure. Ty's the game of the three. Thunder. The sartops in the second. That's a real athleticism for this young man. He's going away from the basket. Seven minutes to play. In the third. Cutting hand against Osobo with the potential. And cutting hand rates it down. His second three in the night. He's doing that a lot. Like his handles and his vision have been really sharp. And he feels a lot more comfortable looking. Awaitful. It's running hand. That's that size that you talk about with cutting hand. You guys that hurt the inches of ball. Dude, it's still. I be the pick. On the run. Got it. Two stores. Somehow. And a foul on Bunch of it. He's got the game pie. There's starting unit. He's been out there this whole area. There's Durin. On the road. All the way down to the wire. Goal beat. Oh, the night side. Good, Ivy. Cutting hand. Takes it in. Scores. No, Osobo. Whether you get down to the three more fingers. Wait till they're credit. White beats. Durin. On the three. Andre Drummond. What's going on? I'm going to put back. The loser's been all over it. Get that match up tonight. And, Andre gets a free run to the rip. Fontekeo took up space inside. Alarm and Durin to come down. So simple. Bunch of it. Blime's on Durin. Close it up. Bunch of it. Bunch of it. With the makeshift finger roll. Drummond, Karuso and White. Yeah, see. I'm going to try double tomorrow. White to Terri. Three. Bang, bang, bang. Fontekeo shoving right up the floor. Deuce ball. Two blocks. Karuso's down. Fontekeo hits the three. Carter. Into dodge. He gets White. Bang it away against the three. Sub. Oh, the glass. The timer. Oh. Flynn. A time off the back rim. Fontekeo uses his size for the offensive board. And steps back from another. Triple his fourth of the night. Off the drum and screen. No. Kobe looking for it. Flynn comes out with it. Malachai. Terri and Terri. Push it. Olma. Bodies on the deck. Drummond to the other way. Lazy. Yeah. We can settle in. Carter comes from the backside from the block. Deuce ball. Bunch of Fontekeo. Jerkies is able to keep that ball alive. Number one offensive rebounder. Great Indian to make. Derosan sneaks up. Oh, he's a son of a... What's that roll? Durant. Catch. They left Fontekeo. Bunch can. They made a pass. Why are they leaving him? They're 30 and third of the year. Ivy got it down to Durant, who got it out. Four punny. But the three-point shot has just been... ...and Rosin's not going to get the ball. Steal by eyes. He puts it in. Bill Supu chasing cutting in. Who finds Thompson and who had outbound the rookie who has barely shot. What? Can't get through Stewart. Find Strollman. Or Deuce. Single-digit game. Single-digit game. It's ugly loss. Cool. The triple snap at 6-game losing streak. The new look. Pistons. Played with more.
