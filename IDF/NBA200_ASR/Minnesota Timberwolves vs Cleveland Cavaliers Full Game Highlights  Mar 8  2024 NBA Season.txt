 We'll get under one. You ready? You game? I'm game. I have to change things up now without Carl Anthony Towns moving forward. Well, he mentioned... Who's that? That's what might have made for Jared Allen. The day is coming, but the cat's back. The ability to create he does that just there. Here comes the team rules. They will be looking to run more according to Chris Finch. And the second chance points for Rudy Gobert. You don't run from that. That was an incredible comeback. And of course, with Al Mitchell and Struse in that box, I'm only got hurt. Edwards with an an1. I'll have to finish big to do it. Allen swatted by Gobert. Edwards, Oka has a question. Kings to the rim. Back and forth with solid defensive plays. What we would expect from the top two scoring defenses in the league is... Edwards, Banks won in. It's an excellent use of the glass. Edwards. It works so much of the two-man game with Cat. Now let's learn to do a little bit with somebody else. The year conversation run of the productive players off the bench. And Audrey is also that. Neat. Got it up ahead of the double team getting out to him to close. Sam Merrill has also entered the game. The shooter for three-point. Great pass. What's this? Garland. Great pass. Terrific vision by Garland. Those steps as he gathered for that layup just tremendous body control. Change of speed. Merrill off the... Jerry Allen screened one of the most pickers in the NBA. Freeze his man up. Shuffle the lot between now and April 14th when the regular season ends. Reed, he's got the rain, and Ginny knocks it down. The Daniels over. What a Merrill! Shut up. They attack Sam Merrill defensively and won. Oh, and again... The evidence of TJ Warren as a veteran is like he comes in and he's not in the way. He finds the right spot. He understands the offense quickly. Knows how to make an impact. He hits the spinner. Reed. Second triple from downtown for Nas. Anthony Edwards is back out there for Minnesota. The first time this cover is Garland Greens of Green. And Garland is body-lagged. You kind of like the league style. I believe that he knocked down that shot. Airball, that one. Garland off the dribble to the round. Garland, boy, he's feeling it right now. Taking over, wants the responsibility without mixture on the floor. Whether he wants it or not, he frankly doesn't have a choice. But it helps. He's in. He's in. He buys it. Edwards, not by Alan. Man, that's strange. Isaac at McEacher in high school. Edwards at Holy Spirit Prep were told that Isaac got the upper hand. 3 and 0 at death. Final minute. Conley probes and figures out a way to keep his balance. Embattically, grammar, I bet y'all, I know words. Lavert off the fake. Under 20 games left on the schedule for most of the NBA. And Anderson fouled in a chance at a 3-point play. The nickname for Kyle Anderson is slow-mo. I'm here talent. As we are referred and Edwards, what the slave on Alan and a technical foul. Whether or not he should be an MVP if the Minnesota Timberwolves can hold onto their position in the absence of Kyle Anderson's talent. Best player on the best team is always a good argument. And with his 11th snag. Read, open. Good run in transition to get to the court. Tonight, something that is definitely a part of his game. But he's been great. And a 3-4. 14 points. Garland steps back to counter. Lavert the other way. Carous Levert in the ring. Go on the third. Ooh, a Goplin. Read will hoist and head. You're going to have to close out a little bit tight. Missing your stars? Figure out a way to win. Read. He's been a monster off the bench. 24 for Nas. Being Lavert, who's been the playmaker. Garland finishes. Coach Nori in the staff. With possession and a 3-point lead under 10 minutes to go. Go bear from Conley and a good decision from Mike again. Out of the. Thevert. One of the things that JB Bickerstaff talked about is Marrow hits the three. They are down three starters tonight. Believe. Terrace. Nice record out. Carland for fall. Execution for Minnesota. 26th in the lead. Alexander Walker. Round and down. Really strong take. Just two shots since. Anderson. Harold making a tough one Kyle gets the bounce. Anderson now with 10 points. Here's Garland. To Allen. Both swan over Go Bear. Conley. Another opportunity. Read. Good reposition. That's a perimeter for three. 29 on six of nine from downtown. What two minutes to go. Good. A Coro. Drax it off. For the flush. A question by Jared Island, but a great pass by a Coro. Conley looked like they had a look for Go Bear. Couldn't get it to him and now Edwards finds. For me. Same results at the other end. Edwards. Read. Spins into the lane and at a round and down. Steps back. And Go Bear gets tangled up inside with Allen. And it's a foul on the two wolves. Jared Island just being active has been so big in the second half of this ballgame. And a technical foul has just been called, I believe, on Go Bear. Oh, no. Don't want to incine you like that. A Coro to set the screen five on the shot clock. Darius going to work on Nas Reed. And it's blocked by Reed. Scramble for the loose ball. And it's a shot clock violation. Ethan has got it. Shot clock. No go. A Coro there in offensive. And the ball. Second night of a bat to back. Will that be an issue from Minnesota here? Lane. 30 now on the night. That's your drop. Whatever you want to call it. He has truly perfected it from all types of angles coming towards the basket. And then to pace him stuff for that is just beautiful. Read for three. Nas, that just shabbing to the night. Nas is out here like what's the record? I'm going for the record from the three point line. My life is first 30 point nights. Before Christmas. What time to do it? Newspaper. More toughness and grit coming up with a big rebound. Biggest app told us that we have become so much better in the trenches. Carlin, hangs in it. Never. Got to switch. Need to the lane now Allen. Over the top of Edwards. One for every day of the week. Three. Timely gets in the lane and this time of getting in was three pointer. Short. Long rebound. The head to Allen and that should wrap things up. Without your all-star point guard. Without your acquisition of the offseason from a team that was in the finals last year. Thank you.
