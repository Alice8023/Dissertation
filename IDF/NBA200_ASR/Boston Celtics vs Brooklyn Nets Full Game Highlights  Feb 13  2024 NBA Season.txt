 What's up a lot of free for a chance? You know, you live for all state. Always had great nuggets to the next note. Sarah, I thought this one was particularly cool. It was Brown except all the way. Brown lobs it in, the work for turns and finishes. Simmons off the bus. Simmons directing traffic. Oh, nice love. Finishes. Finishes on a gorgeous spelt pass from Ben Simmons. There's Holiday. Oh, nice look. White cutting in, finishing. Simmons, missed it badly again. All Boston's points to Patrick Hoonin rose to in 80 Celtics run. Eyes up. Seas 2. Did he spit? Back to Hoonin in the corner. Cut. There's a little curve. Had the size on Bridge Ewton took advantage. Maybe a strong offensive team. Well, because he got multiple guys, two days, putting a paint on his stuff. Oh, man. Ronnie Walker the fourth. He will soon become a steady part of this net's rotation of late Walker. Attached the closeout. Wow. He's a little whirling in with the left hand. He's a little bit. He comes with that rebound. But the activity on the offensive glass in glass in general, my day Ron Sharpen will be good to see you there. Oh, I know. She's not fall off, slide off. You just hope it doesn't end up outside the oven when you do it like that. The pain of the net. Close the foul. He's switching everything, but with they Ron back, obviously that changes how the rotation can be at that. Bridge Ewton's open three. He is good. Don't foul call it. John Vaughan is irate. And I understand why. He is the corner of the other way. Bridge Ewton knocks down a three. This Celtic's team defensively a big reason why top five both offense defense. They cover so much ground. Here's Brown spinning, fading, and tinnig. Like if it is a shot without it had you're actually used in the board. Here's bridges over white amelistic landing. You know what it is, especially after this regular season. Brown kicks it out. Tatum, he got it. 3. Here's Cam Thomas back in. Back iron, no. Holiday the rebound. Here's Brown spinning, pushing, and finishing. And Brooklyn at least is trying to help themselves in that area. Here's Tatum. Tatum's jumper is good. And the largest lead of the night for Boston. And then Tatum. It explosive throwdown. Here's Simmons. By its claxids center of the lane, Holiday will fire. No. Cordett keeps it alive. Another chance for Boston. Tainted with 25 points in the South. Holiday deep inside able to finish. Here's Schroeder. Thomas, but through Boston. Tatum in transition. Look out. Tatum for the rack. Incredibly athletic alley. Been belly flopped on the floor. Five on four the other way. And Cordett left the low to pound it whole. Schroeder. Mountain. Walker. Five to shoot. Thomas. Two to shoot. He will. And hit for three. Heading into the straight deadline. And when he knows moves maybe it may take. And an opportunity for some practices. Good solid practices coming out of it. Holiday. Next. On a three. Holiday five, seven from the floor. Here's Cam Thomas. Is it mid-range? Sure. Ah, by break. He's smartly batting the rebound back to Claxton. Here's Thomas. Catch fire. And hit for three. Here's white. Cordett has to switch on Thomas. Instead it's grounded a quarter on a three. There's holiday. Slings it out. For three. Back down the three. In seconds. Here's Wilson. Bruising to the corner for bridges on the bar. Clack the gobbles it up. Put it back in. For three. So hustle on the defensive side. Thomas to the reverse lays an end. Tatum's three. It's good. Jason Tatum. Barges lead. For Boston. It's Rooter Lops it up. And again, it's a fact that he's trying to learn each other. And Tatum. I'll be on the ran. I mean, if you look at to kind of extend the minutes of players, big picture of things, take a follow-away from Cordett. Cordett lays it in. Sitting when you're up 22. You know, we have a significant lead sometimes. But how will Wilson stroke? In the corner, Holiday Dull. Cordett the rebound. Holiday's push-on rattles it. Your stroeder. Lobbing it up. Ice tab from Simmons. Vino is a wonderful man who runs CAA sports. It's also one. Here's Thomas. He's a pain. And it feels like they're playing well. Just Boston's obviously an excellent team. Here you are down 13. Thomas, he got it. And it's a 10-point game for Cam Thomas. And a turnover here. Here comes Thomas. Thomas. Lobbing it up. And out of the corner. Here comes Thomas. Off the bridges. And he is exposed in the ring. Something year already for him. Remember the nets were down 23 with 4-19 to go in the third. Truder. Oh yeah. That's a foul. Second half turnover. In a lot of that, it gets credit to how Brooklyn has been playing defensively. Getting in passing lanes, looking to the rough. Outbacks to the walk over the scores table. Tatum, the ball fakes. Two is good. 38 for Tatum, 24 points. Top shot. Drew Holiday coming out to contest you a hand. The face. That was deep as well. With three nets with three with at least four fouls. Top is again. That's a two. Just about four minutes to play. 9-point game for the nets. Top do it. Five on the net. Cam Thomas says five for Brooklyn. Bridges five. Oops. The alley. Thomas. With quite watching him. Double comes. We'll sit at deep three. That is good. Three from three for the rookie. It's a six-point game again. Here's Brown. Bustley's picking white. Getting from three. We'll sit. But the sign kicks out and how about Bridges? Sure. There are 11 of 16 from the four of the four. For your points there. Tatum, the screw and plays home. Last. Drew chance here. This holiday trapped. White left alone for a dagger. Derek White was looking where the defense was going to come from. And he realized he had a wide open lane to the hoop. Well, the scist for holiday. A season high is Bridges' play city. And round one of this home and home goes to the Boston Celtics. 118. You.
