 You ready? You game? I'm game. Time's between now and the end of the year. Dallas is won three in a row and Dodge it opens the scoring. They picked up the pace this season. Last year they're 28th and pace. Now they're eight and trying to run more. It's how we're going to get all the way to the basket. Now you get a whole off season together. His guy room and comes off wide open. He's been cute and well. But he came off with too much separation there. The Minga answers for the three of his own and JK's three point shooting. Not taking a ton of moments start from making it in a nice rate. There's the roll to Gafford. Daniel Gafford has made 29 straight shots. Liggins trail three and he got it. How about coming to Angel Wiggins working together? Dodge it again. That ball screen gets him on the warrior center. He's going to be a little bit more than he can. He can't leave your feet. He just cannot do it. Warrior shot selection. They're forcing things a little early here. There's been two six. Patrick. Oh man. Come on. This layup package is second to nine. Right now the shot clock at five. Step back three and nailed it. Now the way he shot it and said Antonio. Like I said, I think his knee is feeling a little better. But that look good. He had 14 the other night. He just said looked at the role. Play Thompson understood at that time. They probably had to talk about it that last time out. The Warriors have found a center by the way. Yeah. Chase Jackson. Davis scoring again. What you do with Luke before someone way and then block the shot. Moody comes away with it. Running with Pajewski to ask you to set them away. That's good basketball. And get to the mid range. Jonathan has just exploded since the calendar. 24 year. Well thrown to lively. Lively and great man. Air Sands. Not only thought he'd be this good, this early. Kaminga from the baseline. Okay. Kaminga is regulated now. Give it to him in the post. It's both sides. And the shot clock down to nine by the time Luke got it. This is where that weight, that height, that size. It's just unusual. Moody on the baseline. Moses Moody. Two hand high rise. Manga on Hardaway Jr. Goes baseline. It's an open Chris Paul three. Pajewski knew. He didn't even wait to catch that. He knew it. Hey, Chris is open to my left. How about Pajewski picking Hardaway Jr. And then having that block. Lively sent it away. I don't five seconds. Hardaway Jr. Three. Hardaway Jr. With the runner and beat the buzzer. Skip pass. DJ Washington. I'd say what? Wiggins contested the FNATS-A NBA. Wiggins have enough blocks. Wiggins out Hardaway. And Gafford has just been the backline defender. Wiggins went from hell to on the ball sprint out there. Oh, what a pass. Brand into Moody. Luke has got Sharreds on a switch. Getting the lane on a step through. That's too easy. A mean euro step. Eric Jones Jr. And you don't want to let him elevate. That was not handled well. It should have been a layup for a dunk. It ends up being a four point swing. The mid-gun is step around. And so Dallas, they are an absolute role. The Warrior offense is hurting. And Steve's got to use another timeout. They got Luke a four of ten shooting. Clay Thompson buries the three. So stop. Score. Stop. Score. Trace pup fake pup fake. That is over rebound. Lively stood tall. And think of it from the foul line. Here come the dogs. Irene. Oh, man. We've got that ball to string. That's graceful, man. Oh, he is something else. Potempski. That's three. Brand in fading and putting it in. And got Tyree. They clear aside. They let him go to work and Gafford is there. I'll take Gafford alively and protected the rim. Flock at ten. Gafford is looking for a slicing Kaminga. And he used the backboard to get around Gafford. Luke got. But he was playing that. Gafford. Minga. I'm taking right at Gafford. Wow. I thought I'd not take a no-port answer. Hopefully Kaminga is okay. I thought he might have rolled an ankle there. Green in the open floor. The Warriors board back defensively. Five second game, shot clock, difference. Wondering down the half. Mid-range Kyrie Irving. Now stop with that. His pull up game. Sweet. There it goes. Fine for that rebound. But it goes right out to clay. Nice move behind the back. Play stops for three. And he got it. He's shooting that three. Fast break. Clay's got it like that. Luke got a nice fast behind his head. No float for the dubs offensively. But he keep looking up and they're down only five. Clay from the baseline. They're down only three. Here comes Clay Thompson. That is a ridiculously tough shot. Lob, well grown and finished. By Daniel Gafford. Went away on the third. Gafford brings it down. He is getting closer to Will's. 32 straight makes. Wiggins. Big shot there for his confidence. He then won it six. Snake Fribble. CP free from the baseline. There you go. Talk about guys with handle like you're talking about Kyrie. Legend in the streets. Chris Paul flipping that up and in. The Minga. Black fight Gafford. Man, his Gafford been amazing. How many blocks is that? Luke got out to XM for three. Balles had been one of 17. They're finding hits a second three. Andrew. On Gafford. That's it gets a gold tan too. Jemceki in trace. Two man game. Brandon for the baseline. The Jemceki's got seven. And look at the dubs. That's a good post up there. He's going to get the foul after the mid-layer. Luke got his first three of the night. And he looks up to the heavens like, he's going to get the foul. He's going to get the foul. He's going to get the foul. Thank you, God. And the players from this, they can't put the ball in the basket. Josh Green. That shit had been a layup. Instead the other way it's a four point swing. The Minga with the three. He's been big time tonight. He comes Kyrie, a hundred miles an hour. And he's really lobbed in perfectly. Just Paul knows that internal clock and he'll bank that one home. There's the score. Now can he get a stop at another score? He's in the lane, dropping off the lively. It's like the shack attack that time. Knees up in the air. Playtops and missing. Tipped up an end. So there are the Warriors on the class again. DJ Washington and Trace Jackson Davis. Sent lively away. And lively stayed with the deducted down. Lively again. I'd say what? He and Gafford. What a center's end of Ferdales. DJ Washington scoring and Steve Perr is sensing that. They're going to use the timeout. And how the biggest leap for the valve is Kyrie's score. Kyrie is starting to take over. Here he goes. GP2, the Trace Jackson Davis. And infatically they do score. 17 straight games played for Tyree Irving. Almost a stretch of the last seven years. That's 10 hard of 18 year hits a three. Dodge it. Easiest lob in the night. And the Warriors will use the timeout. You can just take care of the ball. Execute out. Execute. That's good. Moses Moody and Miss 13 straight threes. You then go. Moody and look on the weak side. Help. Fight Gafford. Man, is he something? It's Pete Day Washington hits a three. I'll take the maps five of 25 on three. He's the other two meetings. As Wiggins. Next somebody said, next to me said, get Wiggins going here in these last couple of minutes. Grasprin. And so they were three of 20. And now all of a sudden the threes are starting to drop for the map. Which is more to the north. Which is 25. Dallas is going to be nine and three in the last 12 against the Ducks. And Kenyatta is following Kyrie. Look at Kyrie Irving. He walks over the event showing them the left hand. And he goes over. Lively inside. But to Robert's it in. Kenyona is in. And Moody Moody and Kamigadario Sharridge is also at the scoring table. And Jerome puts that in. Look at Dodgeds. May end up being the greatest foreign-born player. But Yannis might have something to say about that too. It was Pagent and he hits the three. I'm keeping a notebook now. As a bookie with this line after line here. Look at Dodgeds. This streak of triple doubles comes to an end at seven.
