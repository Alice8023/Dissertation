 You ready? You game? I'm game. They start to play well as a unit and particularly the Bungna brothers are playing great basketball. Open Egypt to Orlando and they are in the visiting glutes at night. You guys don't know about me yet but you're going to. Dejante gives it over to Snipe, he'll fire the three and half. Jalen the third year man from Gotzaga. He'll take the three and make the three. Murray lost a handle. Rob's blocking and transition. Around bag lays it out. They're playing on the Orlando magazine and take those shots and make them prove that he can make those. Rob's nail 10-9 in favor of the visitors. Lobbed a carder. I'll see I believe. They give it to Carter. It looks like Batsazid may have touched it but no. Bay. Three-pointer for Snipe. He's never strung together full straight 20 point games in the NBA. Murray. Well you get him in that fed range. He's automatic. First action of the post-all star. Of course the discadjal for Orlando. Lockner picks it up and fires a three. What a quarter he's having Nick. That's 12 and his second three. We talked earlier about the backup point guard minutes. Well here we go. Kobe Bukkin is in the ballgame now for Atlanta in the middle of Bruno. Banging around against Bukkin and one hands him. That's what I'm talking about. 70 seconds left opening. Bukkin's quarter from Atlanta. Bob Ogner. That's a defender of rebound. I think I got some lift on his feet. Man we've got a blocking foul on Jaylen Johnson. And Isaac is going down in a hug. Well this is the last thing you want to see. But Jonathan headed back to the locker room. He's going to be done for the night. That's for sure. Those are the house rules at State Farmer in. That is correct. Here's a catch and shoot for Kobe. Oh Anthony he will. Little Ed basketball. Engels for three. That's good. That's the guy you got to know where he's at. Yes sir. The guys run to the three-poil line. Neither one of them ran to the basket so hoppers are able to get back. Bulls on the reverse. What a shot by Mark L. That funny looking shot there by folks with their little hits in it. DJ. Hanks a hit. Well he got a smaller cold Anthony. Here's Murray. That's good defense there by Anthony. And all the bots come out. Get in the way it needs to be. But he always have you only have to be a guy that you got to recognize. And you got to know where he's at at all time. But they miss so many shots in the paint. Yes that's it. Here's Hunter. And I'm gonna tell you when you make a shot from the paint. Believe it or not you get more cold. Easy one. Jalen Johnson. That's his first two of the game. He pissed his first six. All the bouts. Lob. Hold one hand. Jam on throwdown by Carter. And look how it worked in the baseline. They got new music and they did talk about how what really came into the music and how inspiration it was. Oh it was very interesting. Like to say. Wow. Nice. Eighth round. Pick overall I should say the first round by Orlando when he came out of Michigan three years ago. Here's Johnson up top. He throws a three. Box turn it over magic with a one point lead under him to go first half. Carter gets right in tight and lays it in. That's that size and strength there by a window card for 24 in the paint. So your point Brian. Another used in three man he's automatically that left corner. All right you know what? Into the paint spins on Capella flips it over the rim. Bogey catches you. Open. Yes. Tonerow from Bogey. But Mark Marshall the season series. Ever game decided by two or fewer or in overtime. To the corner. What the Carter junior? Good luck and stroke that time. Oh. Jalen Johnson answers with a three of his own. That's his second tonight. Murray passes that pass down. Well I saw that comment. Jalen. Ron side steps to get Murray out of the way but missed the shot. One out rebound for Murray. Hawks have numbers. DJs. Cliffs. Jalen lays it in. And Paul on Orlando. Bokker. Driving. Scoring. Nice move. Time out. Bokker. Pull up. For two. Well that's, that's, we saw him take Murray. DJ stepping through. And hits. DJ. Entering fast to Bruno. Murray. He connects. That's a three for Dejante. Has had to deal with injury after injury to starters rotational players and big injuries too. Murray keeps cooking. This is not a break bust offensive team Orlando. 25th the league and scoring. Bruno Huxson. Ray Bond Jalen. Bokker. Knocked away. Hawks defense has picked up. Hawks are trying to push up before Dejante. The Andre. Over to Murray scores again. DJ has old this third quarter. I tell Paul Schuvels it. He used to five. Kind of good shot there. Again there was a rest shot. Didn't have his feet on him. Hawks and Bokker 2-4. Murray again. Hunter. Now Jalen Johnson. Garrison Van Due. Goal Anthony. It's a fact to suck. He'll drive and hook it out. Anthony will fire with that fuse coming out of it. It hits the three. Hawks looking to keep it going. He's going to play an excellent second half. Kobe. Nice. Nice soft touch. Nice. Very nice. Like you're in the lounge. Oh, go for it. Sobs on the drive. DJ, keeping it away from Joe Angles and it's a turnover. Breakout for Jalen's son. And a tie about for Atlanta. Short clock here for Orlando. Boy, great deep on the Hawks hand. The lucky bounce goes for Orlando. Late 17, still on a minute's restriction coming back from Italy. Cole Anthony got it. Three for Cole gives him a dozen. Anthony. And another time out for Quinn. Jalen looks sucks. Right down the middle. Lays it in. Again. Too easy. Cross court pay. Corner for Jalen. On the bounce. City. Beautiful pass by Jalen. Yes, indeed. Hawks have done enough to ball fake beauty. And Hunter. Berries a big three. Team boys off the fence again tonight. 105, 89, 1-0 Carter. Three on the wing. 12 on the shot clock. And Jalen steals the bounce pass. Yips a two-static for the jam. Magic hold the ball. The buzzer sounds. And the Hawks have the victory. Atlanta. I'll score Orlando 65 to 41 in the 6th. You
