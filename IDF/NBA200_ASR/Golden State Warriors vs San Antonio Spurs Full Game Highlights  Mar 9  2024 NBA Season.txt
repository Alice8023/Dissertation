 You ready? You game? I'm game. My bad, I was a tie. During the break, the guys must have been in the gym, just work on the three-well. But tonight has to be one of those nights where you rack up the paint points. No wind, Vinyama. He's the best shop blocker in the league. Get inside. So Chris Paul, brand of Pajewski, Kaminga. Craymond, Drea and Trace Jackson Davis. Chris Paul opens the scoring. They're a young team, but they're saying, we've come together. We've come play with teams. So hot. He'll launch the three and wrap it right through. So it'll all around the streets and long clothes out to get the paint easier. That college tonight. But Trace Jackson Davis, you see, let's see. Yannis and Tennikuko found out. He can find out too. Kaminga, you talked about it. You see Trace stay down. Challenge that shop. Close to miss. Blind rebound. And then so on the beneficiary. Craymond, looking for Moody on the cut. Well played by Wesley. Craymond crosses on number. And he's got to keep his guy only embraced this. The scoring has gone up. Yalda Johnson bottoming in three. What is in the water in San Antonio? Told you, man. They're shooting it. They're going to push. Seventh and three. They should frequency. They like to get up and down. They got to have the rest of it. There's the lock. Japs game. The TJD. The captain Johnson. They can throw him off the three point line. Follow inside. Good. Off things. They still work. Leapers like to expose it. That's how they're defensively. They get to it. Nice. Inbound under. And it's Wiggins. Let's go. It's Clayton's. VPM thing. Yeah. Good. Man, you look yourself for all the people. That NBOD pass. Is it Max for Stappenheim? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Psychological debacle. Take Graham. He buries a three. One more chance here. One point to now. No time to catch a shoot. Clay. Catch a shoot. There's time. Got to the three and the corner. You got some separation. Limited to Warriors. 51 to 4, 55-41. And it's get pass not the way, but extra effort. And put up an end by Barlow. So he has been. Ray Jones. Looking after there's a lot of Kelly Philly again. He's not getting a body on. Keldin Johnson hitting the three. And so. Right there. 18th and offensive rebound. So the low after. They're just getting all the balls first. You know what's going on. They're going to get through the score there. Open ball. He gets the offensive rebound three. This end of the four. Who can they unlock scoring wise? Wait, right. You mentioned they played three games with that stuff. They have not won any of them. Got a little charge off the bench and into the bucket. He wasted no time. There's so hot again. Fsk made him give it up. Back inside. Charges there. But Jeremy Sohan scoring on the other side. 19 of 36 on the guy that was. Kind of making shots. Plates Hanson is in Poucho. Champaign. Kitchen 2-3. San Antonio. Same each other up. It's also easier to play with a large double digit lead. I mean, this first confidence is off the charts right now. But the Warriors are searching. Play Thompson. Wow. That is a very tough shot. Got it back at the end. Finish it off. So hot has been the problem. But that's how I'm sent away. Feed the hot hand. Plates Hanson. Three. Got it. He's got 13. Geldor Johnson. Another straight line drive. Champaign, the open green. And they knocked him down. Nine of 14. Malakai Brown got this ball in the air. That college going to launch. Come on out. What a aim left, though. He can have a big third quarter. Get some traction offensively. Send his spurs back into here we go again, though. Malakai Brown opens to make it a 21-point lead. He starts to look at just the math for the Warriors. Graeme on the Pajewski. And here comes Kamengas Sauri. Malakai starts. And Ricochet from Graeme on the play. Play starting this second half. Pajewski is first bucket of the night and it's a three. You can see the Warriors in 14 a game and 54% on three. Send it there. Paul. What a fight. The Graeme on green. There's a blow. Paulins was in there. He's got a 20-wonder within 10. And again, Shay Center fully involved. And a car loan puts it up in here. I like it. I do too. The rebounding energy, the scoring is up. He's only 20 years old. I mean, he is just trying to stay with play. That's a great screen and play hits a three. Again, coming up with the rebound. Camenny opens three. You gotta get back in transition. They're saying, I'm not giving a blob roll for Dubs. We're gonna see if guys can hit jumpers. And the only guy hitting jumpers is that guy. Play Thompson. And that's Arla who was on that tornado. And Wesley ready to the floor. It's transition deep in. Before the timeout, two defenders stayed with one. The time the Warriors have made a move. Birds about an answer. And Ricochet is off the trace and the Warriors turned it over. Bought 10 grand for three. And it's done. Every took that work it out. Moody. Straight line from the finish. There's your ball screen. And Fujitsky just slipped out of my touch there. Golden Johnson three. I mean, they're rolling it in. It's off the front rim. The ball's extremely well right now. Jetsky throwing that blob and trace. Duncan you down is on the foul. Get the crowd back into it. It's his catch radius is anywhere. He missed the creep though. Jetsky getting it to trace. He went to send it down and stuck lead in. And he's seen it. Jetsky made a pay time. I'll take grand number jumper. Oh! Rebound from Miga. And then look what I found. Barlow puts it in right away. It's right time. Moody catching. Moody to beat the buzzer. Now they're going to wave it off. Here you're going to need a miraculous fourth throw. And starts with a turnover. It's not far low for the dump. That same potential. The order's got that rebound. OK. Moody finishing. And foul. Jets penny from D. It may not make a difference. What the war is a three. I can't believe it. Watch out. Right top. Sit all the way to the rim. Great. Thompson's got some hand. He can move his feet. It can be contact and out. He's at home breaking the face. It's all hand. Very so has been great. Players and double figures. The Miga cutting back. Door to lay it up. It's a perfect split. As soon as you see. So shooting. Even this step against Chicago. Step five of 18. And whatever reason after the. I'm not coming out. Step more. You can do much better. D. It's not impossible. As Kamehka flies in. Kamehka. Miga attacking still on. Got to drop it to trace. And he did. See now that's the next objective. Davis. And then Pagetski to steal. But now it's going to duck it down. Alright. San Antonio still on pace. Miga again. Miga plays finding moody. You know we can't say that. It's true. You don't play Sacramento or Phoenix. And more so you can't head to head. And Barlow have yourself a career night. And the sit Pagetski the same. Miga's a dog. He's still there. I know the starters. There's a brand. Malakite. Brando's been impressive. Less than rhythm breeze for this first. Don't let them get hot. Because you know what's good? Let the team get hot as can you know this spice one. Let the team get hot. Tessley team has been shooting this well. And any team in the NBA can get you. And Miga may be the biggest coach of all time.
