 You're the linkers. There is the Angela Russell. He hit a big shot last night from almost that exact spot. Obvi and out. This is like, you've got to go all the way to the store. Bagley and out of Obvi and this is what he can do. Knock it down from the outside. If you've got a couple of guys that can knock down open looks. Here we go in the break. Look on down the middle. Oh no, great. I'm going down. The ball is going down. The ball is going down. The ball is going down. The ball is going down. The ball is going down. The ball is going down. The ball is going down. The broad James. Jones who set the all time NBA rep for a sister turn on the ratio. A couple of years is back at it again. And he hits out little floater in the lane. The visits of last 12 and a little. But only five of them in double digits. Stop, shoot, got it. Stop touch. Off the bridge. Dan, once again, along the baseline. Jones, bounces. Obvi, three. That's a great shot, huh? So little two-man game finds Russell. Yeah. I just have said it many times. You just can't double team off of the entry pass game. Little pass off and just in the game and knocking it down. It is always. Here comes LeBron with the left hand slam. Don't take it away by roux. A couple of big steps. Hot you more. Oh, and right there to get it. Is Dave As is a lot going on under there. The mixer and Davis have the two hand done. Blue, wind up like an idol. All the way to score. Jordan pool. And one, not a great foul. Or did we sing this game last night? Baker's bank, Jordan pool. Got another one for Washington. The lowest 3.1 percentage among players with at least 303 points rise. That's how much he's been struggling there. Go, down it. Anthony Davis. All the way out, Paul Bowman. Finds who else. That's his sweet spot. And then? Well, out of the do anything here, sweet spot. He's been shooting. I know. Well, what shot is good? Actually, this is one of two teams watching to do bottom five offensively and defensively. The only other team are the Charlotte Hornets. Just as good as play. Another log just can shot. And he knocks it down. Jackson Hays is in the game for the latest. As his match, Kristi goes to the basketball. To lay it up and end. Underneath it, Jackson Hays. Beautifully run from LeBron. LeBron, office foot. And how they got a three on two. This is big toe. Jordan pool, cut it. Goes, it goes. And pool. About 12 points in 10 minutes. LeBron's got this one. Yeah, finished by Bagley. LeBron on the left. Point. Hit that mushroom under the hoop. Did he? He just do get back. The defensively. The pool gun care. He done weighty. Bats it in. And a bit of a surprise. He's spent your winny. That's good. One way or another. It's got to get a shot up. Here he is right now for three straight away. Right there. Kyle Kuzma. Exactly what I anticipate. Hays Jones, a rare turnover. Right behind the bat. Really, Russell. Right. Kuzma. Goes and Dan. And now we hit Javall Murray as less a game with this. Until injury all the way to the basket, Jordan pool. They're on a roll over. Russell Angeles. Reversed lap. Anthony Davis. Reversed up. Defender felt it. I don't know if Shabbat was going to have a chance anyway. He was. All the way to the rim. Nice girl. You're a nice girl by Kuzma. Get ready. Down for three. Davis. I wouldn't have to get the ball to Anthony Davis right here. Even those infected from there, he can get it deeper and really put pressure on their defense. And a Jordan pool. That's a lonely enough. And we're going to divide it up the defender. Good. I'm going to get it. I'm going to get it. I'm going to get it. I'm going to get it. I'm going to get it. I'm going to get it. I'm going to get it. I'm going to get it. I'm going to get it. That was the best wasn't there. I don't know. Come on man. Why I had to get it exactly. I really don't know. That was the fastest in this time. Really sharp here to start the second half. Mid-range AD, that's usually money, and it is cash right there for Anthony Davis. Leaky out his LeBlanc, up on the ring. Here he goes. Back in the red score. There we go. LeBlanc gets up, trying to play a little defense. Under this really awesome goal. We've made the clippers in their next game, but we're here in LA for four days. Danny's got yet another one. Kind of his 15 points to be of a three. Look out with authority. Look out below. Anthony Davis on the way. Reves in the game just two points. So it's been an off night for him, and down to the other end, the wizard's score. Oh, Kisper, that's a beautiful play. And who is the most personal goal? Very much so. Now it's LeBlanc. Nobody's picking him off, and he goes around two to score. This first. Oh, that time Davis got the pistol and saves him. Oh my goodness. And then Reves can't get it from LeBlanc. Great saves by Anthony Davis. One way, that the other. Reves really does some work. Oh, Anthony Davis. Especially give those points to Anthony Davis. That's the good one. Look out. Here comes Davis. Now Max has an assist. He got into the stat book that time. Did he? Reves lay it up and in. Boy, that's like a layup line at the beginning of the game. Oh, Reves. That's not a little way. He goes right to Anthony Davis. He's under the score. Now that's what he is right. That was some nice footwork though. So Rich's didn't score a down a little bit. And Max just shot up it in by Reves. And he'll make a better, a lot of just lead over the game. Like George Pourole. Poule with some speed. Poule can't help. Got himself two point under plus. And he was there. Max got a bit goal. It's counted. Max Christy says I'll show these vets how to make a layup. So like show fans, he regal the blind starts the border with a drop shot baseline. Poule, Reves lay up his sensational. 28 points for him. LeBron gets double team. Wide open. Fly by. Delo, three. Yes. Andrelo with a triple. Baggy the third. There's the South Paw. Nice touch. Oh, Jack's head. That's our goal, Ted, on its way down. Most of them are in and around the restricut area. In and up, back in again for the former warrior, Jordan Poule. When Poule having himself in quite a game with 31, Torian Prince, got it. The pass. Better died that time by rush. Just now, just terrible defense. He didn't even die. He just like circles in like a two foot area. Baggy. And a nice performance for him. Raptive number two overall. And then, he's a really good match. Soft touch. Good to go. Look around all the way. Give it up to 80 to finish it. Assist number seven for James. He fans up. He's really kind of. So LeBron, boy, that was just hanging on the rim of us. Channing leading in and storing. Inside Reves out of the good one by Kuzma. He gets to the dribble. Bows at a good bounce. Skip pass to Abdiye. They're going to get through back in the ball then. Right just look at it. Get in with the on. LeBron taking charge. That's Kuzma again with a good dish. That's too good a assist in her over him. Jones corner. They take full advantage of it. Reves. LeBron. Oh, that was close. Don't call it. That was an offensive fight. You got a man missing out here. Please, you go into the unit. There's Kuzma outside and Washington has the lead. Who's all the way to hook side is good. Little running hook. They are all the way. Got it. Just shot for Austin. James. Damien. This is LeBron. 1-24, 1-23. Brown on its feet. Cool. On its way. Got it. Jordan. Cool. LeBron all the way. Brown, Brown, Brown. He's got to get in the action. Or seven to shoot. LeBron just died. Baggy over. Baggy. And here is Paul. Jordan Paul to win the game. We're going overtime. First possession of the extra period. And down goes Steve on his score. Who's the opponent? Three. Yes. And now Kuzma is for three. Here comes two other. And LeBron does it again. Brought by James. One of the players of the game with off-flats to retire it up. He's got him. Defense at one end. Hit from downtown at the other. LeBron, basketball. Here comes Greatest. Greatest finish. And James. And go. Who's the best get around Rudy? Hands in the air. As we know where to go with it. Stutters gum. Wait. Paul is not even close. Well, he's still getting a good job on defense. Who's the top? Who's the top? They top it all the way up. And it goes to Rudy. And back to Rudy. And the Lakers are going to win it.
