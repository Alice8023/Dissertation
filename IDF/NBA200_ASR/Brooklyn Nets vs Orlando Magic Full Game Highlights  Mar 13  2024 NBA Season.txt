Orlando and Brooklyn. See, play a minute. Still looking for our first clock to do the game. And then, right side taped up. He's missed the last two games with a fine contusion. Damn Thomas. He's pushed shot off the glass and in. We'll reach it up to the right side. On the line. Sun. Recenters. Aaron. The Carter. From the corner. For three. Give me a sister. Five. Give me one. One. One.

Frank, Beard Martin. not giving the nets an opportunity to set up on the deep incident. Brutal from the clasped in screen. The net's now Thomas will drive against us. Comment high off the glass. No grip. We've added by folks. Mancaro. We got to. All it takes is one number five. Hello, Ben. Carrow. He won the 14. What a great start for the magic. Coming off back to back losses against the community. There's Thomas with the answer. Hustling back. Setting it up. In goes. The bolts. Bump's is way through. Oh, Wagner, backstuff against Black. The not a sore threat from out there. Thomas. Just spin. Johnson. Riven challenged by Isaac still puts it in and a foul on Jonathan Isaac. Very, very efficient. On the catch the shoot three fall. Blackston with a whirling to hand it up. I'm playing. Blackston brings it down. And the week was 17 and down to the 13. Cameron Johnson. Cuts the lead down to 10. How does that mean? I was passed the five. There is a brother. For the two handed up. Poor communication on that week side. Everybody on that net's team. Drawing kick was beautiful. I find nothing run after the net's cut the lead to 10. Then it's mid junior knocks down on three. Bother's defended by Bridges. Pick a wall with this brother. Moe Bother from bronze bother. Oh. He goes. Take it. They can get out the front five. The three ball is good. And there's a fight. 13. They've led by 17. Anthony. So they're coming. From five. He was a coach when he got as far as he did. What a down by Carter. Into the hands of Paris. Three on two. Paris to the basket. And that will prompt the Cavanaugh. Time out. The magic. I've been as deploy at the second quarter. They run sharp and it pulled away. Paris attacks and lays it in. Very. So fair as you. As good pressure and the basketball. Seven unanswered points for the man. It's a clever step through moved by Dorian. Finney Smith. The fouls is in the sun. The shot is in and out. The rebound. They run. Do it. Not a say. That's to the basket puts it in and draws the foul. And we're done. Drives in. Bounces it out to Smith. And it's mid junior. He's made two from that spot. 28% shooter. Sucks turns it over. Smith with the quick hands makes it an eight point game. There's one of those ball movement plays. Thomas for three. Got it. 16 on the shot clock. Mancaro dribbling. And it's the three. Rides to the basket. Scores with the left hand and finish. Thomas ran into some trampant. Lobbed at the clacks. Then the magic steal it. Mancaro with five. There runs with the dunk. What a pass. So fast. Okay, Bridges. Trying to get himself going here in the third quarter. Here will drive down. Pull up on the way back in. Speed against 50 fifth. The shot no good. The rebound. Carner. No, no, no. It's not going to go. Something rub that one through. Sucks to make Karra. And Karo backing out against. Two defenders there. He steps through and lays it in. How nice is that. How about that football? Yeah. Shot clock under 10. Shooter. Against the screen gives it back to the screen. Setter and Paxton drops it through. Five yards of Mancaro. Shooter maxed up again. It comes to the double team. Ross Fogger chased off the three-point line. Here's the pass to Harris. Open from the corner. He got it for three. Nobody guards him to let it go. Which is nice and there to close the door. The previous pulled up a while shot. Stuffed in by Blacksmith. Johnson tried to keep hold of the front. Can't do it. Pass comes back though and it's stolen by Shooter. Shooter swings it right side of Johnson. The three is no good. Half-dead by. Well, Jonathan Isaac. And he really sent it out. Wilson guards him. Three ball. Tell him. It's good. We've talked about it all season long. Having a healthy J.I. in the postseason. Listen. Oh, yeah. There's going to be a game champion. No doubt. Here comes the magic. Harris the ball up three. Let's get it for Reba. Damn Thomas. Damn Johnson in a while. Yep. Hold Anthony. Knocked away. But then in the hands of Isaac. Shot clock at a wall. Isaac Wilson. Thomas. Not running. We found. And Thomas gets it back. Shooter again. This one's good. Open chair on him. The loser. Johnson to Thomas. Thomas attacks. Bridges winds up with the loose ball. Sizeable lead for landing. There was Thomas. Blackston. Back to Dennis. Shooter. Three point attempt. It's good. Not the success of the arena. Something blew down with clear over the ring. We have to win by having. Thomas with the. Friving to. Spontan Anthony. Res the needle to the basket. Plots from behind. Max and got it. Bridges. Takes an out-bonger and lays it in. Touch the lead. Shot clock is down to five. Roger. The warrant. Gives the Anthony. Swings at the. Go to the three point shot. And it goes in. And the. No, no, no, no. Shot clock is four. Step back three.
