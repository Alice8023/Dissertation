 You ready? You game? I'm game. My bad was the time. Four. Paul Granandreet, the center court, built Kennedy in between and early got a chicken wing right in the mouth. The game, Kennedy, definitely avoids that and we play on with the thunder holding possession of the ball. Getty on top here to J. LeBoyance. Into the lane to the glass. The lane up in the air. Die after the paint. I don't talk to you. You'll just say, no, Marry wants to do what on the offense. He wants to play in the middle of the floor and get busy by goal by pulling up in mid range. He's what second in the odds right now for MVP. Yep. And you see, Paul Gran's skills and the offensive and a full display in just two possessions. Shider than left eye. Here's Reef. I think they're in. They rotate it outside. Grant's straight away, but Grant knocks it down and he is sent to his backside and he will shoot with a chance. I have a four and a four and a four. You're asking me to go way back inside for five years after the long time. Homebren on the exchange of possession swings over the door and he knocks it down. Simon's trying to turn the corner, waiting for him as Gidey out on top to Reef. He drives by door into the lane, laid it up and in as he got up under. Did they need to take the shot or drive right by? Door drops it off for homebren. The retreats to the right side below the break and knocks down a triple. We're on a little inside out number. Number one defense in the league. And he just set the scene early on. Let his teammates make plays. It could be an X factor for him. Leading back, scoring a shake, yielding to Alexander and the paint. Space the floor. Be ready to be a cat's a shoot player. Fible double kicks, Hagen spares down, nice five. Inside Walker, put her on the deck till he hit him. He's your cycle the ball to Hagen's. Makes another nice pass to Fible. He runs out of room and he makes it even more splendid. Bounce past Walker. Probably been to some of those parents' pass of weeks. Spend one. Hagen's leading up strong as he gets up over Williams. I call two for one cat. And up comes shake, yield to Alexander in a hurry. Toe drag into a runner off the class up and in. Here we'll penetration against this thing moving. Single handedly, Grant turns the corner on the rookie wall. He can't scoop and then wall is releases down the floor for a two-hand check. He gets cross-court here in transition to Lou Fair. Grant, he's done. Tough shot as he turns on Williams and popped it right in his face. Thunder on top here by five, 922 to go second-quarter. The first up six and home for the Blazer. He's on the sprinting. We're in back in it with two hands. From the rim, they get 33.4% of their shots. That's 17th and the most of the really, really good off as the teams are top 10 in the. This is a thunder team that keeps the Blazer in. I said by 62 this year, then to end it against them with the contest on the shot. Oh man. They tried a low-knop on it with two guys. Each snipped that right out and he was gone. The taps were recovered by Pan. Yeah, I'm sorry, Cam. There are a lot of times as the Lama makes that quick move. I know you like it when he says it, but there are a lot of times. He's the only center that has that right now. J. Gilgis, Alexander off the home-grid screen. Drills one outside. Blazer's on the two-for-one and Lou Dord is saying, he cannot be a part of this game. So, J. Gilgis, you got one to the corner. Stan Stil is the open player on that. It's just how the best goal about getting him to basketball. Where it is an easier catch. Williams trying to shake off Simon's. It's a step back, Jim. We're seeing a brass gun. A Canadian connection. The pass. Nice pass. And then slide a reef of a duck. One more to go. The duck's a hard-trees made. And the ability to pass. He just gives you a set of just its a whole other dimension. And then the Blazers on the ensuing possession by the Thunder. Bring him down. Get down the floor and grant with a two-hand hammer. The Blazers are hanging tough now. Thunder throwing up a lot of bricks right now. And opening up. Turning to the Blazers. Grant the jump-ass cross-court deflected. Simon's straightaway trying to like that fuse. Three does. That gets the crowd. We know it is a fourth quarter dynamo. So it's SGA. He'll drive into the lane. Go to the glass and lay it up in here. Yeah, it's not purely a one-on-one situation. And again down on Simon's. Look at the post. There's a flex of scores. And Simon's saying that he got a chicken wing or was put to grant. Simon's step back for free. Yes, sir. Anytime they find that match up, they are going to go at it. Resignments on the open floor. Simon's two or four from three. Fourteen points. SGA backs in turns. Another physical confrontation with Simon's. And another foul on Simon's. What do you want for me? A lot of talent. On the inbound. Simon's in three. Got it. Oh, the light has been on it. Simon's was 17, three or five shooting from three. Okay. Oh, I know. I'm wearing glasses. Here's SGA into the lane. He extends with the left arm and rubber bands one up and then. Is it a make or miss once he gets into the paint? That exchange of Simon's. To walk or intercepted by Gordon Hayward and a three for Gordon Hayward. Yeah. And that gets out of quicker. Can I have not he got six seconds to work? SGA backs weaves, fakes, fires, counter if it goes, pod iron and rolled in. I think it was the bar trying to give Delano space to go right on. It was. Yeah, he was a no man. Yeah, space to go underneath. And providing presence right there on his hip. Two minutes got by here in the fourth. We're back then just to his lap. Right. And knocks down the three Delano bands. Turn in the corner of Holbert going downhill. Level of the ball Walker denied. Shed at the rim. Shed at Boyd's contact. Walker finds the rock. Gives the Simon's pumps a three up and in. He comes alive in the fourth. Jalen Williams a drop step spin under control. The scoop as he's coming down. 80% from the freak ol' line along with. Carletters, Carletters, Kevin Durant and Herb Jones. Find you. There you go, bar. Good find, World Walker. On to Miss by Simon's. Some of the Blazers youngsters who are so promising and stuff, so much to build on. And Matisse gets the deflection. Let's do it. Go right now. There's your talent. There's veteran talent. Is that pretty Simon's? Who bridges the gap? They just want to find a better position for it. It's a surprise if that choice is shot by SGA or in the end of the clock at three. Allowing the Blazers to come the other way with possession. Murray to five. Back to Murray. The rookie gives it back to the veteran. And he knocks it down. A final three. Number one of the league in steals. He heads the other way. Double team. Out on top. Williams to three. Jalen Williams. Knacks down to three straight away. Set up on the pick. Let's grab a foul again. He's still a wrap loaded up and in. And he got cracked from behind. He goes to Salmoget. And they're gone and run away by. Quickly they come to Williams. Off the screen. Longer. He has a good up top two. Had jam. Yeah. Matisse was in a right spot. But that ball went up a little bit higher. From O.K.C. Thunder by six. Williams off the high screen. Reath gives it a poke. He dives for it. He spins and loops it ahead. Murray tracks it down. A galloping two hand jam. Blanzer's within four. Door to mid court. SGA. Now in his hands with 15 to shoot. Off the way. A tenon ocean from Grail. Drive it instead. Go to the rack. No. Followed up and in by Gidey. Thunder by six. Gidey. A creative passer. Leads it outside to SGA. Into the paint. Pull up. Hanks on the Arden rolled in. 13 to shoot. You like that Williams on Simon's. He's switching. Now I like this match up even better. Hold on on Simon's. But he's the long way from home and Williams. We'll take over. Shoot and score. On the year. Coming off a dispoying loss. And Los Angeles to the Lakers. One day one sixteen one on four tonight. They beat the Blazers. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One.
