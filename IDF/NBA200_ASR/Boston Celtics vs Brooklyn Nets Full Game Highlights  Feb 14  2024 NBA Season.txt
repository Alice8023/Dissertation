 ftaus the way. Oh, it's Sinkus. He's not that shy. Yeah, I see what you are. He works on that a hard line. Seltzer's looking to push. Right. It's the cute. You know what I like about that is just, and I think that's the thing that the Selvets have been getting into the last month of the season is they find that mismatch and then they try to punish that. There's a nice little floater by Shudder in the lane and he gets his team on the board. Quickly in on the hands of Hologram. Down low. Sinkus mismatch and his favorite and easy to. Too bad chance really. Just track it down. Skip to out deep. How is it? I expect this Selvets would have played even faster than they had in the lane. Strong mark moves a bucket there. Nine and a shock pop. T is nice pass. Great action right there. Great action, Dill, which is switches. For Sinkus to good pass inside and white. Yes, too. We're killing it. We're killing it right now. The most surprising thing is I remember poor Sinkus and watching him and thinking like one or two options that guy. Oh, strong move by Sinkus. It didn't equate to what he does for this team now. It's a nice move in the first option. It's a nice move in the fourth. And he's good with that, but he does. Smith can't hit the shot. Two minutes of late four. And the strong move through to the hoop again. Time for Sinkus. We can go back and take it. It's all picked off. Riges not straight down from the corner. The only time I can get a seed like this is if I'm hanging out with you Mike. Riges, next down the jumper. A bright light almost every single night. And the Celtics are playing defense tonight, kids. Yeah, the perimeter defense I think is eight more right now. You get to sit next to a legend and then you go tomorrow and we'll get to see another legend. How about that second one anyway? Great put back. Three. Good. Highest score by Korn. I'll tell you what. The Celtics defense is on point. They're on the ring. They're moving. They're communicating. How is there a deep? The difference between the two offenses is one team is getting great looks and the other one is taking congestive. Jumpers. Nonstop. Bridge hit knocks down to three. I'm thinking of these going next there. Down by 30 and then the score. Tate on. Tate is coming back in. Eight in the shot clock. Tate takes it. Highest hustle by holidays. He'll try again. $2. Fun, haven't you? This is so cool. Johnson. Back to back success. This is the reason why I would say it's surprising. I know that we're going to be good but it usually takes a time for teams to get clicking. But the fact is seamlessly size advanced. Double team comes. Bridge hit. Finish it all. But where it's going to be. White knocks it down to the Celtics. Going for a two for one. Oh, run to running about two. 12. This is a three. White is open and he carries them. Tate, checking out who's with them. That's five feet outside the line. I think it's easy. How could that be? You've seen the total evolution from rookie season to right now. What is the biggest leap in his game that you've seen? To piggyback all of that, do you think that is because players around him are better than he trusts his teammates a lot more? That's a real question. I guess if you want to look and really try and try to find things that get wrong, I don't think there's anything really wrong with this roster. I think how they might play the difference of this team is that we played inside outside. And the last few years we were more of an outside inside team. Yeah. Of any team this year. We were on the receiving end. And they're walking up against him. How does it continue to drain? Well, I was trying to give myself free. It's a nice screen. Top of the key and white gets a bench. And I like to walk down right there. We didn't fight. Yeah. What about it, Dapp? He's the best player on the team. The best score on the team will be 10 times. But Bridges definitely is a two-way player. Checked out by Bridges gets a way ahead quickly. And I finished. And then Bridges to her. Okay, I'm up and under. And he gets to. And I'm not. So we should be interested, man. We can. It will be. That was a nice feed by Johnson then. Woffer game to. Again. You're a guy that's coming off the bench. You're always auditioning for 29 other teams. So this is an opportunity to take off here. Hey. Hey. We're pocket for two. We're pocket for two. We're pocket for two. Bridges takes it. He's great patient. Great patient. You learn more and join today, Michael. All right. Thank you. That's probably the best trip you've had up to four. Hey, good. Hey, Bridges continues to watch. I don't know if you're agree with this. Let's go. This is all the size or all the things where you could. You could have any kind of excuses of where you could come out and not play hard. You're ready to go as you put your net, put it in the basket right here. And bring them all back your way. So I'm not mad at it at all. Those guidelines are brought to you by tonight. Explorched. I love those small things and basketball players who are 30 work. You think Kate can be a help? She definitely can be a help. You're set down to use the screen. Come back to the way. And chance for three point play. How you always do this game? Just give them all. I just say this is 50 points. That's good folks. We'll do that games. Now it's over. We'll be back here, ramp it up. It's still sleeping. Thanks for watching.
