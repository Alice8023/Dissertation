 And the Milwaukee Box. Nice flip for BAM. He draws two defenders. That leaves Yolvid's open. Kaboom. That great lead start. His start for Yolvid. Nannis coming right at BAM. Nice pass for Brooke Lopez. Good defense by Yolvid, but Lopez able to power down the 7-1 center out of Stanford. First Duncan for three. Duncan Robinson going downtown for the first time tonight is 130th triple of the season. And that's their three point specialization relief. And former Florida state seminal, having 153s for him, BAM keeps it alive. Goes up for the two hand. Duncan over Yolvid. Here's Yolvid, an angle three. Kaboom. That's easily had to change his mind on the three. Lopez will fire and miss. And Yolvid came right over the top of BAM for the rebound and score. But a play by Audit de Cumbreau is first bucket tonight using the glass. Tyler Hirol like this was home and it basically is. Here's Lopez faking the corner three. Now backing up and taking. And missing. No, slammed in by out of the Cumbreau. Weasel League and Dunks and layups. Here's BAM. 15 footer measured it perfectly. That's his second score tonight. Tyler down the runway. Easy one for Dave Lilley. He's 12 season in the NBA. Eight times an awesome. And the ball swings back to Hirol for three. Kaboom. Five points for Hirol. That's his 111th triple this season. And the 114 lead in last one. Yonnis got two back quickly. So three scores in a row for him. BAM swings in and beat Lopez. Robinson from the corner. Kaboom. Really moving well without the ball looking for any opportunity. Yonnis comes right back with another school in Yovic. Junkim for three. Yes. Yovic from deep. Yes. That one was deep at 28 footer for Yovic. A blow by and a slam done for Yonnis out at the combo. He has a dozen. Oh, the block shot there. Lillard had it blocked. And here comes Yovic's nice feed. Hock has who finishes. What a beautiful play. And what a quarter Yovic is at. Yonnis again. He's keeping the box in and he's got a dozen first quarter points. Martin. Well done. Six on the shot clock. He's got a piece of it. Got it. That's a big piece of it. He's got eight points. Well, I'm almost smashed. And there they are again. The hero at a bio connection of it. Inside the Hock has, oh, beautiful. Inside, outside basketball and a chance in a three point blow. The trail, three from Lopez. Bounces him. Conan and nice pass reportus. Dukton on love then hits the short left handed hook. Hero for three. Capoe. Tyler hero, his second triple. Give him eight points. And as out at the Cumpo, another pretty success story. Here's hero with an open three. Why don't you? Capoe. Yonnis back out to Lopez. With one on the shot clock. Collide with Heismith and hits the running hook. Oh, that's a difficult shot he had to make. Hock has gone at Lopez for the score. Hock has scared of no man. He's on a wall off out of the Cumpo. He spins through and finds porthouse by himself. A Bobby porthouse. You cannot leave him out there. He's got 63 dribbles issued. There's another shooter. Nico Yalbets going bottoms up. That's his fourth triple of the game. He's got 14 points. Oh, Lillard, it counts. Plus a foul. Yonnis. Oh, you can't stop that. You see why it leads the league in layups and ducks. Hock and shadowed by Lopez get rid of him. And now gets it back and fires. Cabo. You can't leave that man. He's still two and a half minutes left in the hand. Yonnis for three. I coughed it up. Hock and racing with Lillard, another box. Hero finishes. Tyler Hero with an eight point quarter. The Mkits from the open. For the school. Yonnis on a reach out against BAM. Both men played very well in the first half. Look turn around. That's a good shot. Show's wise. Just so good. The players in the league. Even when you do everything right. They can still make plays. Like Tyler Hero. Floating and finding the bottom of that net. He's got 15 points to them. Yonnis. Off balance, but on target. They needed somebody with a leg foul there on the floor. He's providing good solid defense, but a shot making is the nonexpected. Now the Lillard's streak continues. Game Lillard gets his first triple. Lillard takes another. And Barry's. Early in the third quarter. 9-40 left in his area. The Stunken Church, the corner. Finds BAM for the two hand stuff. Beautiful feed by Duncan Robinson. That's his fourth assist. Really accurate passor. He's been setting up BAM. Oh, beastly knocks in a three. And his third triple of the game. Two of the Shacklachio. Yovic got it off and in. Yonnis, great spin. What footwork and the finishing touch. I'm a speed. He shoots 50 cents per cent. And I place like that. Bam, high post feed. With a cutting Duncan Robinson in his 19 points. Game Lillard. The left hand dribbles in the lane for the back shot. And Flood gates have opened for Lillard only at five first hand points. Duncan takes the lane. Finds an open Yovic for three. Kabo. Five 20 left of the third. Hock has lost it momentarily. Finds Yovic for the jump hook. 23 for Nico. Hock has going in. Lopez sent it out third leading Shacklachio this year. It gets almost three again. And speaking of three, Kevin Love joins the three points splash party. These are guys that have been there. They want to win. There's buy-in for them to make another championship. How about Duncan Robinson? Duncan and Drive-in. Heismith sent it back. What a block by Haywood. Bam, surrounded. Finds Love for the triple. Kabo. Picture. Perfect. Basketball tonight for the heat. Yonah's bottled up. Finds Beverly for the three. And he makes Patrick Beverly his first score tonight. 21 to 7. Heed and points off turnovers. Bam, knocks in the turn-around jumper in the paint. Bam is the number eight score in the paint in the NBA. Kevin Love straight away three. Kabo. They haven't loved. They have a three second half triple tonight for Caleb. Love for three. Got another one. Love that shooting. Love this game. Beeson for Kurt. By the way, he with 30 assists. Yonah's turn to over again on a really nice defense on the ball on the double team from Bam who found Love for the score. Got it and picks up the loose ball. Portis. Yep. Abby Portis says triple twice tonight. He has 16 bench points for the buck. Heizman. Bam with another offensive rebound. Was hanging on that end line. Finds Love. Fakes it. Now fires it. And makes it. He thought he was fouled. He is fired up. But time out to the bucks. As they heat it. Trying to run away and high. And just such a collective effort. Another well orchestrated half court offensive set with the ball moving. The spacing proper and allows. On the heat of breach 110 points in the game this year. They've got 21 and 7. AJ Green with a triple. Six minutes play in the game. Hawke has Barry's play. He's got well points. Fennasus gets to the basket and. A buck should won the first two games in this series. They only swept the heat and regular season series one time. Oh, Bochan with a jump. He's for come, sealer rookie. Nice behind the back. He could have Bochan slammed. It's so encouraging. Nice slam dunk finish for Orlando Dauvin. What a performance tonight for Eric Spulster's Miami Heat. Take good.
