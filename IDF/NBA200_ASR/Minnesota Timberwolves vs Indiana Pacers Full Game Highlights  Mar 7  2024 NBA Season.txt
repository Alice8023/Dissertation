 You ready? You game? I'm game. 39% Skip has to have a burden out of turner. Tyrese and he's on the board early. Well, he's back because he had joy in that. That's the top scoring defense in the NBA. A hundred to six and a half points per game. And Alexander Walker. Makes it down these sides. Shot clock is seven. Alibur inside and will account. I think they say it's good. We've got to follow and come. We'll get a chance to see what he plays for. He's going to be a good player. He's going to be a good player. We'll get a chance to see what he plays like. Two years ago Anthony Edwards had 37 in this building. They lob it now and McDaniel's don't sit. And words to Anderson. Wow, good pass. He threw that pass with steam. That the only place that he could win. He's with OVN and now you're good. He's got a lot. That's my second. Yeah, now he has two. What he did with all the top that they took out. It's been a 40% or better. It's going to shoot her all year. Ed, we're waiting to see if you're going to get the Pacers. So this is where you can play. He with the second unit because you don't. If you're not going to be able to keep tie on the floor, you need to have Siacamu. Very good. McDaniel's a whip it now to Warren again on the baseline. Goes inside and his return to the NBA. He has a basket. Siacamu spins and scores. There's only the other end, defensively. Eighteen times. And that's a basket and a foul. Gobert got it in. Minnesotta only allows 44 and a half. Edwards for three. Here's Haliburne. And it's the agent makes something of it. That's fine. You get him again. He just celebrated. You got to look at that. You're going to have to look at it. Find Jackson for the dunk. Really nice job. That's because time was moving. McDaniel's. There's Siacamu on the run and he's going to dunk it. Fourteen for Pascal Siacamu. As a 15 point first half, stop and go. Solid defense. Read. Finds the basket. He's got 11. What he can do. And gobert 10 with six rebounds to pace Minnesota. And hard steps into another jumper. Did a great job reading it. Who did gobert? Wasn't going to come out. He's good. We'll do it again. Hit this time. Officer, we found a really nice five turner. To eighteen advantage for the Pacers in Dallas. And gobert got it from Conley. Pacers have cut it to seven. And he's got it from the back. Count the basket and a foul. Minnesota's won the last five. They've swept the last couple of years. And that's a basket by Anderson. Now Haliburton goes inside. Count the basket. He gathered that. And an Anderson foul to the me. He's with it just hit a three. Stop and go. And go to the left to the basket. Close it down to a liberty. Go. Haliburton finds Siacum. Challenges go bear. And we're tied at sixty six. We're doing that just a patient ever. Haliburton. Haliburton with read back. Turner. Pounds at home. Pacers have the lead. Defense gets you some offense. And Shepherd has come in. Here's a deep three by Edwards. It's good. Twenty two for Edwards. Edwards gets inside again. Are they calling that? Are they calling that a basket? Yeah, I figured they'd call that a basket. Yeah, he's been a game changer for them coming over from Utah. Haliburton for three. Got it. His first. He's got three. Whoo! The entire third quarter. Nice change of pace there. Top it up under Pacers back in front. The change of pace made him had to react off the top of it. Stafsport 31 points. Minnesota with just nineteen. That's no good put up. And thrown down by Reed. He's got thirteen off the bench. Haliburton scored three. He's got a nice play there. A little bit of x-action. In that third quarter we had nine lead changes and five ties. So the two rookies out there, Walker and Shepherd. Anderson. Slow move. And they've been able to get the defense. Smith got his hands on it because that ball was being lobbed. And Toppen missed it put in by Smith. And he got taken away by McCommer. You got him. Shepherd puts it up. He tried to tear drop. He got back in there and knocked it out of the hands of Kyle Anderson. And those are the two rookies. Final pick of the first round back in twenty-four. And the tie is in and toted it. Here's Shepherd for three. And right away Tyree's gives up and gives him a doubt. Smith ready to check back in. Edward's free throw line. Anderson with his fifth foul. Inside six to play. Siacum attacks go there to the basket. Spin and win for Pascal. Two teams have similar records. Haliburton got the roll. He's got to go that way. Chris got forcing into it. They will not let him get right. Minnesota 16 and 12 in clutch. The Pacer's 17 and 13. So very similar. Here's a steal. Nim Hard. Raid play. And dissipated it on coming out of Edward's. Haliburton dancing. Kyle Anderson defending. Haliburton beats him. Puts it up off the glass. And the Pacers have the lead. Really in a sweet move there by Haliburton with a little bump. Shot clock down to four. You can still go to the show. That's a good use. He's still going to shout out to you. Is that good, ladies and gentlemen? 35. He is 36. Haliburton. Siacum goes in. Who does that? How does it do this? Other places to get some offense. And then that nearly is affected. In the corner, Conley is going to step back. And then he's going to throw it down. And then he's going to get the lead. Now, he's going to get it. And then he's going to get the lead. That's a good use. And then he's going to take it off the screen. Edward's launches a three and hits. When it's time, you've got to play. He's... And out of the double team, Edward has it inside a minute. Minnesota in control by three. Edward's, again, it's a five-point lead. He's got 41. You would call out. Take shots. Edward's is taking 34 shots, Chris. Haliburton, now to turn her. His three is good. Pacer's needed that and did it very quickly. There comes the double. Edward's again. It's inside and Edward's hits. 43. He'll lose. They knocked him over. Now you've got to foul. You've got to get him to foul. And that took about nine seconds off the clock. That was a difference. He was able to get it out of it. Edward's as tight as season high with 44. Still got to... To give Minnesota a three-point lead, he missed it. Pacer's are not going with a timeout. They advanced the ball. He's missed. Lies it up. Oh, man. It defense the play. At least Smith was trying to get to the rim. They blocked it. You
