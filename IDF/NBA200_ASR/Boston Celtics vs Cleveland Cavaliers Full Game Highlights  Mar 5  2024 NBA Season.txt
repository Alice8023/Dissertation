 You ready? You game? I'm game. Front of us, I need people over here start standing up. You see this over here? It's good now. You're gonna see a lot of this. This is gonna last for about three minutes. Cab has had missed their last six shots and now trailed by four. Brown all the way to the 10, making it look easy. It's a better fit for his skill set. Leverd, Paul Figg on a three takes it in. Inside the throwdown for Jared Allen and the foul. So their ability to spread the floor with the shooting now something they really lack the season ago. Down goes Howard. Carlin, put him on the floor. To get open. 23-15 Celtics, Allen good position. Ooh, if you're believing. Front guard, correct porter, junior is in. The jumper goes into three. Neang doesn't take the three instead penetrates. Leverd, the back end, the turn around. It's got a Boston is six of 13 from three point territory. Tatum, over a porter. Beats the buzzer. Jason Tatum buries a triple. And mobility taps the ball to himself. That was actually one of the better defensive possessions for Pleaton. And kept the ball in front of him. And then I give reward with the triple in transition from the bird. Trying to take Neang off the triple. Neang loses his balance. Open look, holiday. In, out and in. For true holiday. The preparation has been through the roof. The attention of detail. Navi leaders get that bucket to cash in. Sizing up Neang. There's Cornette runs in the knee. Extra. Tatum. Nice vision from Cornette. Then out lead by 10. O'Coro back in. Takes it at Cornette. High off the window doesn't go. Allen is there. Loose change for Gerard L. Gives it up. Catch and fire. Doesn't go. How is her? Offense aboard. And how is her is there? After Brown comes away with 100%. And that's the fight you get. Anybody you talk to associated with the ball is from Celtics. No look. Gerard L. Stucks it down. Off the blinds feed from Carlin. Be right. There have not been a lot of whistles here in this first half. White upstairs. The quick from Porzingus. Gerard Allen is now 6-11 from the field. He's got 13.7 rebounds. Tatum is going off. 22 points. Nine points. Short pot for Jalen Brown. So Boston's lead is now 14. Two for one opportunity. The fate away. Darius Corlin. Nylon. They're going to need him to find his rhythm offensively in a second. Boston finished with six blocks in the first half. Leigh by 10. Mowgli still looking for his first points. And they're gone on the opening possession of the second half. Of seven straight games against teams over 500. So they're doing it against legitimate competition. And keep in mind they played Denver Thursday. So, Carlin cans a triple. Against this Celtics defense. It's going to be hard for him to get opportunity. There was a good one just couldn't convert. Stop and go by White Holiday. He's going to take it over Merrill. Cut. Next. Break opportunity here for Boston. Brown looking for the trailer. Porzinga Shubbles. And it finishes. Sunday they led by 44 and half time. Schimmer on a low pass. And it bounces off the hands of Merrill. Brown. Oh, he went for the big finish. He got the nine by the rim. But the follow-go is for Jalen Brown. Leeda's double figures they can add to it currently in 11-point cushion. Tato coughs it up. Mobley on the run. Give it up. A coral running back for Mobley. Cutter. Allen. Oh, threw down. That's a good job of being patient there by Mobley not going for the pump phase. Mobley. Slams it down. Off the feed from Carlin. 69-62. Celtics. Come shot. Come. Terrius Carlin. One thing I love about by Hauser. Merrill on a handoff for Laverte. Four minutes to go in the third. Laverte Shubbles. And Blacks the rim. What we talked about in that first half, right? Forcing that aggression of the Celtics defense against Brown. Left hand. You know, he likes that. He's a good catcher shooting 56% in the third quarter. Laverte. Walk in the tight-loop turnover. It rolled off the leg of Allen. White crosses. Spans loses his front. Oh, excuse me. The basket goes in. It's all the stuff you're teaching with your G-League squad. Carries over. Yeah, it's almost like play a development, right? Sure. Porford. Can's a triple. White bounces for Zingus. Yeah, that's a good one. I'm the one who's got a double. I've come off. Easy one for Horford. I'm the crowd one or the travel, but I thought that was a good no-car. The A comes over to help defensively. Brown jumper. Golem and a foul. A chance for four. And I also like the fact that they reversed it. And they get points at the end of this third quarter. Pritchard protects. Tosses it on. Cornet slams it down on the pretty feed from Pritchard. That was physical. The official, the allowing the players to play a little bit more. Porford short. Wade couldn't grab it. Pritchard does lay up. Rolls down. For Peyton Pritchard. The two teams have been called for just nine fouls. So fast-paced one here in Cleveland. Much to the liking of the Celtics. And another second chance opportunity. It's Jason Tatum with the doose. And it's obviously Yang has been terrific Max True, who's obviously also not playing tonight as well. And so I do think that this will literally that you're going to get through to the next round. And then he hangs in a triple. Left goes shoes he had on the night. Oh, it's red, the red. Oh yeah. He knows that he can see the shoes. He's a very aware feedout. Man, trucks in a three. Too big for Horford now low. Cut Wade. The stop. The vertical at the end. The vertical at the end. The vertical at the end. Garland kicked Wade. Is he feeling it? Oh yeah. 325 to go. Wade for Nia. Garland uses it. Garland goes behind the back. We have a chance. The side of their last six at home against the Celtics. We are down to a minute 42 to play. Perzinga is back door to holiday. So well done. To set a screen, go up top. Alan couldn't grab it. And it's handled by White. Celtics are on the move. They're down by two. Perzinga for long strides. Lay up. The vert. Ten to shoot. Now it's Garland. Drive to the ramp. Left hand. No. It's Steve Wade. Coming out of nowhere. Seven seconds left. Tatum. That a four seconds. Three seconds. Tatum. Bade. It is no good. And a foul comb with point seven. After a few, the leg kicked by the right leg of Tatum. It was deemed to make contact with Garland. Otherwise, contact would not have happened. Therefore, the ruling on the four is over time. It's not enough enough as a foul on Tatum as it didn't take. By the Boston Celtics. They got very stagnant. And there was no movement. And it really allowed an underman cab fee to be able to defend it. Boston will use a tie knot. They controlled the jump pole. And had a plan in place to call the time out. They didn't have enough time.
