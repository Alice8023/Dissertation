 You ready? You game? I'm game. We'll jump it and away we go on a double header Tuesday on TNT. Celtics with the first possession right away. You see Ubrei picking up Tatum. Now the switch. Jason Tatum going to work on Maxi. It gets inside and gets the scoring started. You're doing that in the post where they've really had a point of emphasis on that this season. Core 3, Buddy Heal. One of the new asixirs acquisitions. Short-handed and they are small and often Nick Nurse will roll out a three-guard lineup. Healed on the cutting. Harris and he's fouled. Porzing is got him to buy his Harris. In the NBA this year. True holiday picks up Healed. Now Maxi trying to turn the corner gets by holiday and lays it in. Boston rated three defensively. They are the number one offensive team as Brown scores again in South. Three raid in the pain right now for Boston and Ubrei with a steal. Maxi guarded by a white. Little step back three is good. Tyree is Maxi. He can get a card. I think he's a little upset to be left off grants. Team USA roster. At least the. Paul's bow. Cocks it back. And powers it down. He strengthens the ability to take the contacts. No question early on. He would pull up now. He's not afraid of the contact. As a result, gets to the line and beat you a multiple of ways. There's post up possessions. There's a lot of peas in there. A lot of litteration there. Poor thing is in post ups and possessions. There's Tyree's Maxi. The flow game is excellent. Maxi scores again. A joel in beat kind of moves. So it does indicate that they are hopeful that in beat will return as Maxi. A big part in the lorry goes. Oh boy. It's been working on that all day. Still not quite there. Great. I don't know. I guess it's working. Ricky council able to score it inside. Maxi with picture on him. Maxi contact. Counted. And one for Tyree's Maxi. Maxi now. How's her is on him. How's her moves his feet well. Maxi gets five on the floater. Late clock. Oh, a follow by Ricky council. Thanks to Christophe's poor Zengus. So him post up quite a bit in that first quarter campaign. First minutes on the floor. A quiet via tree. It is interesting watching how Boston is reacting to the personnel that's on the floor. It's brown. Scores it in one. And a chance of three for Jalen Brown. I'm going to attract to have the most efficient offense in the NBA hits. Here is Batum for three rattles at home. Batum picked up by Pritchard. Here is Ubrae now. Working with Bomba. And Kelly Ubrae with the little floater with the left hand. A strong hand. Through holiday. And the controls here looking for Brown posting up on Lowry and Brown. And we're going to drop one in. Celtic swarm. Here comes Maxi. Shifty. Pain drives floater. No, the follow by Mo Bomba. Why drives it? Maxi with the block from behind. Sixers by four in the ball. Here's Harris now. Take it on Cortet. And Harris gets it to go. You know they have a one or two coming in them. But in transition, Brown flies and lays it in. Like Boston trying to get it done on defense once again. Brown with the deflection. Brown drives it. And Brown scores again. He's got 12 in the quarter. They have grabbed the lead. Maxi fires. And Maxi hits. And big time shot right there. Here's Maxi now. Driving. Pull up over Port Vegas. And he gets the shooter's bounce. Derek White looking for a two for one. That one's good. Derek White having a career year this year for Boston. That was a great contest without fouling there. White on a red line throws it down. The space is cleared for White. Don't want to overlook a team because Joel and Dee's not here. And right away, it looks like Boston coming out with a sense of urgency out of halftime. Boston trying to stretch their lead. For either team at this point. And Holliday adds to it. And Holliday off to a good start in the third quarter. Textbook defense. Textbook post defense. And great contest. And Brown misses that Port Vegas. With the follow. And right now, Boston 36 points in the lead. Just having their way. And Port Vegas going. And two more. And two handed jam. Half time walker room. Sixers have just one made field goal. Missed their first seven of this quarter. But they've hit on back to back now. As Mo Pamba delivers, maybe Nick Nurse was upset about. But Buddy Hill had an open three. Yeah, I'm livid day. Maxie a long three. And he hits over Port Zingas. Got a play like AI here in this second half. Pamba ends up on Brown. That's a mismatch. Brown gets by it easily. And lays it in. And more points in the pain for the Celtics. Match of problems on both ends of the floor. Celtics lead it by 10. How's er on Maxie? Maxie right by him. And Maxie fly into the basket for the reverse. For Zingas ends up on Pamba. And again, this roughs one. For Zingas has been a beast, defensively. Brown tries to the basket. Lays it in. Stacking them up here. Eight-oh run for Boston. There are 14 and a big shot. Philly needed that one badly. Trying to win their ninth consecutive game. As Maxie drives kicks Tobias Harris for three. Got it. And that was all over. And that was great. Celtics have taken advantage. Crawford. No. And there's Council with a rebound. Under a minute to go. 12-point Boston lead. Council. A little loose with a ball, but it gets into the paint and scores. And one. And now Tate, what five to shoot, goes to work. Tate. Drives in, missed the left. Chance at the last shot. But Philadelphia gives it away. And Tate is there for the dunk. Another turnover there. And they were trying to hold step, chase and Tate, on that possession. Hey! Here goes Council. Takes the contact and scores. And the score. The small lineup. They'll be able to get into the paint. No rim protection at all for Philadelphia. Cam. Pain goes high off the window. Land hard. You see 37-year-old now. Horford on the floor. See if the Celtics have an answer. And it is Tate. He is an answer. An MVP candidate. He's got a chance at three. Celtics still won that game. Pain. Fires over. Horford. And Cam. Trills the three-pointer. Lowry comes out of the pack. Here's Harris now. Kyle Lowry gives it right back. Harris catches shoot. Sixers rating in the threes. The last three possessions. And the ball, Council. Earning his minutes by him this game. Holiday. Had a trade. Holiday. Rainbow. Midrange. Jumper is good. Boston needed that. Boston ready to get Horsey. And Jalen Brown. Horford in the paint. And he delivers. And Eric Wright defending. Tate him drives. Fange ro. Fange mach 23. Points in the paint in transition baskets. That's been the difference maker offensively for the Celtics. Horsey goes keeps it alive. Maxi and Harris. Horsey is going to have its stuff. last year in the postseason, that they relied too much on the deep-point shooting and had those lows as well. The brotherhood. Last year that knocked out Philadelphia in round two. Tatum of the Steel, Tatum of the Ace, two goals. One-a-quarter. He's got 28 for the night. Maxie leads all scores with 32. And we hit the two-minute mark, Jalen Brown and Ewan. Well, the Celtics with Dallas coming in here.
