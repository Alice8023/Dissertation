 There's our ball will toss it. And we are underway. Grizzlies have it first. Glad you're with us, wherever you may be on this Valentine's night. Jerry Batty. The ball will in Brooks. Double comes by Shen Goon. Sante repositions for three. It's through. Sante all the way. Brings the ball from downtown. He's last 13 appearances for the Grizzlies. The script has been for his Grizzlies team in these first quarters. Really come out shooting a three ball well at Shen Goon. Thompson. Grizzlies have not seen him this year but out with various injuries. Shot clock down to two. Double clutches. Spires fills it up. Three threes from three different Grizzlies as they lead at nine steps. Three gone by first quarter. A con our deep three. Bang go. All right Grizzlies. TG Jackson in for the first time tonight. Al Dama goes to the best for the Grizzlies. Great weaving his way back. Hand in layup is in. That's what they worked on. Jared backs down. Puts it up. And thanks it in. The beats have shot both. Both into the game. Bill and a little post up turn around is in. Bill and Brooks. Jared out of the double. Zaire extra pass. A GG three. Bang go. GG Jackson. Out of the double scene. Quickly with a good pass. Grizzlies nine assists on 11 baskets. Al Dama back in the game. Jared's out. GG for three. Bang go again. GG Jackson. Two for two for three. One for three. One for three. One for three. One for three. One for three. One for three. One for three. One for three. One for three. Two for two for downtown. Shock lock is dark. Houston has a foul to give. Good one for two seconds. Zaire to beat the buzzer. Got it. Counting for Zaire Williams. Let's say this on. Jared rolls in. She's offensive four for the Grizzlies now. Thank you. Get in. The foul. Jared rolls. K-D for two. It's bounce off the miss. Nate Williams in for the first time. The first time coming in, tape punches that one down. Tape. Caverj just more at that point. Oh! Zaire Williams and the foul. Rose. Drives and scores. But right in. Nate Williams the second year pro out of Buffalo. Houston has lost their last five on the road. Their last road when came in late January. Again, Charlotte, Jeff Green. Good one going straight down into lane. and Holiday thanks it up and in. Jordan Goodwin. 18 for that they were going at 120 again. Around the rim and in for Nate Hinton. And the men are going to allow a quick little run here by Houston. Brooks put the turn around. He runs back into game. Spinning Jared flipped that ball. He's going to have a good time. And then he's going to have a setback. Rejected by Jaylen Green. Hinton on the attack. And the third foul on Jaylen Jackson. Junior. Ford is shooting for Jaylen Green. Airballs are green. And an offensive rebound and a stick back. It's working on sales office and we're just business of jobs. But we're letting it affect us defensively. We've got to get back. We've got to have that same energy on the defensive side spot. And then good with seven loose ball. It's going to be another Houston dump. And the Grizzly's called for time. So your Williams is in Thompson followed by Shengoon. And he's going to straight line drive it. Vince. All done. Vince Williams Jr. has been the assist of the game. 20 when they trail at half time. Shot clock down to four. Bill and Brooks with a drive. Leeder off glasses around the end. And it's a seven point game. Houston has never led in this game. Nice little gift of Vince. Aldama. Card. A clean three. Can go. Luke Bernard. Four or five from behind the audience. Having different points of attack for Jayren. And he gets stripped of the basketball. Thompson. Said in the last game. He's going to be in the lead to Seaheld. Terrific deliver. Another big assistant. And Jayren the hoop and the harm. And Jayren is going to have to sit on the floor. And our Stevens helped the Grizzlies make a rally against New Orleans. Couldn't quite finish it off. Brandon Hagenwood, big shots down the stretch of the bar. He smitten. Banks it in. He should 51% in the second half. And they're giving up 57 points on average. Shengoon in the lane forever hooks it up an end. Hooks it up and in. With a back tap, rebound, Lamar. Going into the paint, 10 to shoot, faces up, builds it up. Exactly what he did in the second half. Get good, block by Vince. And then a foul on him, on Char. Should've been a jump ball if he'd go up, but he never, and he never let's go to basketball with two hands. And the bar, Stevens, deflected it off of Shen Gunzel. Was an over and back, now he tried. You look at him, pull up our Stevens, send it in to Levin. That's why I got to sleep on that left leg. That was all the way. What you've done in the NBA, you've gotten a, at least some of a blueprint. Tom's in all the way to the basket. I like that. Thompson back the other way. Derek Rose at the scores table. Holiday drills the three. Bruts for three. Thompson, take off the reload. It's the three. Second chance points offensive rebound. And the Grizzlies by four. Jiren Jackson, Jr. is at the scores table. Four fouls have kept him quiet tonight. Thompson, I like that point. Jey Shontate, out of throwback. Shontak locked down the three. Hippens got to go. And here is the three. Jey Shontate. Jey G. Yes, taking it to distance. Very violent. Also, that's the fourth foul on Thompson. Shengoon got the hook to roll in. Shengoon out with 14. Shengoon, goodwin, comes to double. Thompson to throw out. That impact winning basketball. And with the physical frame that he has, he's the mold of a wing that we haven't had recently. He's has more work to do with the semilinks. But we believe in him. And we're going to go to court to help him realize that potential. Hinden straight line, Brut, got by. Hinden gets off. Hinden get by Steven's Jeff Green reverses it in. And Houston to Lee. Rose down the lane. Yes. Come shot, Derek Rose. Zaire off the curls. Jeyran to angle three. He loves the shot and it loves the back. Thompson going to the Euro and a slam. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. He's being bold. Shengoon sees it double. Holiday hits the three. And the rocket's back with it. For a rocket's team that averages. 14. And our got to the cut and flips it up ahead. Hinden rockets try to get it into the hands of Bill and Brooks. Good way with a steal. Track by homo Dave and he lays it up ahead. Steven's fight to shoot. Works against Shengoon, elevates and hits. Love Irish Stevens. Nine from a Irish Stevens. Under four remaining shot clock. At five. Jeyran to another three. Go ahead again. Jeyran Jackson Jr. Three shriples in the form. Lost the handle. Thompson, he loses the handle. Jabari Smith, Shengoon finishes. For the rockets. We've lost your last five on the road. Brooks flashes open for three and splashes at Dylan Rose. What's up? It's going out. We come back in with Hinden in that Jeylen Green. Holiday. It's the three. Holiday is one guy. Rebound racked back to him. Jabari Smith. He misses the three. Holiday. One thing for the Grizzies. Rebound is seven assists to go with those double figures. Brooks hits the three. But it does not matter. One, 21. The one, 13, the Grizzies. The Grizzies. The Grizzies. The Grizzies. The Grizzies. The Grizzies. The Grizzies. The Grizzies. The Grizzies. The Grizzies. The Grizzies. The Grizzies. The Grizzies. The Grizzies. The Grizzies. The Grizzies. The Grizzies.
