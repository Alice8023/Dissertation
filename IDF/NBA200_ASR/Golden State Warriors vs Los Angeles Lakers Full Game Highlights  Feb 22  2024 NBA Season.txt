 We'll get one more. You ready? You game? I'm game. Warriors, it's the second of four meetings. You've got it for you here on TNT. Russell, the touch doesn't go. Davis pins it against the glass. Somehow massages it in. They have not been a great offensive rebounding team for Shay. Curry. Right out of the gate for the Warriors with a triple. Curry. Got another. It's a three. Davis layup goes. Dreyman Grand. Bingo for three. Best shooting year of his career. Acheem Murrow. The touch. The touch. The dazzle. It's Curry to Wiggins for the big finish. What a feed. Wow. The launch from Reaves. It's a triple. A Gymsky that sweeping move. D9. Acheem Murrow says no stepping in. Acheem Murrow. Russell gets it ahead. For it's for Davis for two. I like this also. As we said, very good running team. Stop Curry. Smoking high. The handles from Russell, the shield, the corkscrew. The Angela Russell with a nifty play going to the rim. Three-checked it by Davis. And Curry was out of bounds as the ball landed on him. The joker is silky smooth. Acheem Murrow. Bet away. Hot Curry. Touch pass. Wiggins gets an open look. It's a Curry. Golden State has missed seven and a row. Lakers have missed four in the row. Until that fucking from Anthony Davis. Wow. Curry. That banker goes. Stop Curry. Using the collapse. The acceleration by Reaves and runs into the stanchion. He was looking for a whistle. Oh, Davis on the rac attack for LA Curry. Oh yeah. Bachelors game with the Tears drop. Lakers dealing with a bunch of injuries still. Whistle, the corner pop is pure. Warriors are scoring. Will right now. Get Pachewski. Which is hand and Davis. He was all over and he tracked him from the start. Christy aggressive play and he gets to the paint for two. That's a seventh turn over though. That has been a Golden State Grand Prix long time. Plex. Knaps it in from the corner. Dario Sharich who steeped first. Wow. Jackson Hayes with a grown man's jam. Wow. Jackson Davis turns inside for the doose. A Shimura. Heroes and scores. They signed into a three year 51 million dollar deal. Darmin Ham says, hey, we're really believing the guy. Upstairs, Jackson Davis on the finish. The setup by Clay Thompson. Wiggins, dump down. Davis. No. Get the roll. What's he trying to turn the corner tonight? By T.J.D. Thompson. Jackson Davis doing it on both ends of the floor for the Warriors. No. Jackson Davis. Hevers it down. And another tasty dish from Curry. Sharich gets inside. There's a difference in how aggressive you attack the rim. We make them e-bubbles as out of the game. Austin Reeves like to match up with Sharich and he makes him pay on the fade away. Green, the open look. He goes last. Come in, go. From Davis. They wanted it to count. It won't. Reeves. Tries and scores. Green directing traffic. Curry. Now low. Creative. Curry whips it to the outside. Wiggins. Jackson himself with the floor. But Chebsky hands a triple. Green, feed it. Extra. But Chebsky. Got a three. That's the Warriors at their best with that bum. A fake from Reeves takes it in. And it goes down for Austin Reeves. 60 to 54 Warriors in front. Curry. Another. Steph Curry. Squatch it. One by Wiggins. Quick opportunity. Curry. For two. That's the Warriors out of the time out again. Go to that one. Just to the side. And that's going to count. Kaminga got it on the way down. For Chebsky. That's really deep. The following goes down. Put it in by Wiggins as he beats the clock. Reeves nails it with a shot clock winding down to cut into this golden staple. No LeBron James out of the left ankle. Kaminga answers. With a triple. Russell through it right to Curry. Now to reach to the ramp and Curry's going to win. Russell Fendahl. Bounce Davis swoops in for the bucket. Bounce it. Davis. It's good. High screen Curry comes. Manga all the way for the hammer. Kaminga head and shoulder fit. Green. Open look. Flash city. For Kramer and Green. As Curry gets inside and puts some English on it for the bucket. You get the number one seed in the West. And you might have to play a loyalty with Steph Curry on the West postseason. Curry. Bounce. Duff it inside. Davis. The upflaked. The help by Wiggins. And he just gave Davis a taste of his own medicine with a block. Thompson drives. Dishes Wiggins. With the land. Reaves who has put up 14. Jack off two more for Austin Reaves. Diddwoody to spin. Give it up. Davis gets the juice. Diddwoody hangs. Can't finish. Davis gathers. And the baby hook goes for Anthony Davis. Thompson. Hold it on the board. It's a three. Kaminga with four. With three. Kaminga blocked by Christie. Right back. Kaminga is there to beat the buzzer. Russell. Count it for three. Wiggins one on one. Get it to go over Dindler. Josh. And Hamlin did Wiggins kick out. Wiggins locked it up. By. It's a three. Gonna rough shooting that is one of nine. For play Thompson. Russell. Book it. It's a three. Wiggins. Drives. Fend off. And takes off the challenge of Hayes defensively. To get the juice. Dindler. Goes all the way. And a chance at a three point play. For Spencer Dindler. Jackson Davis. A tack mode. Kaminga. What by, not your mark. Extra feed. Kaminga. He gets around. Friends. For the power jam. And the flush. Jackson Davis. Curry. Mr. three point territory. Back top by Jackson Davis. Kelly. And Roaster Hill. Lot of activity around the NBA today. So, her key jerky moves. From the Skylar maze. His second bucket. And at 117-102. It's just over three minutes to go. Cento. Skylar. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Golden State has 30 assists tonight. Gideon S. Run one-handed on the go. Clear by Sharj. Kravitan. That's a good one. That's how the Warriors play off the offensive blast. Warriors trigger in. Golden State just keeps on winning. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one.
