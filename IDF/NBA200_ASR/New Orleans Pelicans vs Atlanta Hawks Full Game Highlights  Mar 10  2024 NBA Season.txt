 Welcome to one. You ready? You game? I'm game. Beat. Looks, Spine's Murray on the bass line. Cross to Bogey. Six on the shot clock sets up, Bay for an open look. Oh man, let's do it to see Bay. Zion Williams and draws to the defensively right to the basket. And he puts that to close. He kept a live by Coppola. Good job by Clint. Bogey. Oh no, those three Spogies. What happens when you keep the ball? Brandon Egrif, back to McCullum, C.J. Noted three point shooter drills it. Yes, one the best in the league. Dijante underneath, Coppola. Boy, getting Clint Bob to prove the first quarter. My goodness. Good, B.I. took out some frustration on that one. Now to Wesley Matthews. Cross court to Garrison. He gets in close and throws it in. Versus another rebound. And underneath a big time jam. Up top Murphy. And he nails it. Against the Raptors on Tuesday night in Toronto. Helikins lead at 24-18 and they are running inside out flies to tuck at home. 11 to three Spurg here by the Pelicans. Bogey. From 15 right elbow for two. And he's got a good job to cut off the driving lanes for Williams. But the other guys are going at it. And a shot at the end of a quarter is denied by Bruto. It's 50%. Zion gives it up to the corner Marshall. That's a three. And you have different people each and every night that could be true. Bogey rises up and connects. Like I said, you know that S. Or I said Hawks are in a zone. Deep and trying to keep Zion out of the paint. Murphy likes it flying. It's another one. But if he didn't shot, call him out two at a time. Just got to move the ball from the side to side more. Murphy. Good again. And John Zayn-Mori off the Bruto screen. Over the length of Nance. Flush. Follow Bruto. That helps. Nance. And a crowd gets rid of it. After Murphy. Man is he hot. Mine goodness. Four or three is off the bench for Drake Murphy. Hunter lost the dribble. Taking away by Zion. Zixx on Bruto. Lobs it. Flush by Murphy. He's got a 24-24. Flim. He's got a 24-29. Bogey. He broke loose. And again, you've got to know your personnel. Valentino's back in the game. Herb Jones. Banks one out. Stop it. Stop it. Yeah, you're going to tell me him. Bogey. Good again. Again, you don't close it out. Brandon Agram had a driving lane and capitalized. Yeah, you know, the Hawks. On. Off the glass. That's his fourth. Plinkabella. Sidi. Demory. DJ. Quick three over. Murphy is good. And Black like that. On Peach Tree TV and around the state of the Peach Tree Sports Network. Here's Agram on the drive. And in. Brandon Agram has six. Second half ahead of Valentino's. Valentino's is on the bench for the Rawlins. Murray up the lane. Murray going right ahead. Backer out to Agram. Post up Zion. Oh, the big man can motor in that post. DJ's pants rolls out to Beats. Acrobatics save on a Sidi. T's up, Coppela. Oh, my, how about feet? That's what I'm talking about that activity. 61 50 New Orleans. In the middle of Zion to the basket. Well, again, if you're going to have your big guy on the wing, now showing a little two three zone. Coppela in the middle of it. Good hands on a steel. Herb Jowl is going to take it home. Number 16 of the ligands. Here's CJ. Starting to cook. Gets in the paint. Heels it out. Another one by Murphy. Oh, some more Murphy. Really at three point of the game. Inside Bruno. Valentino's back in there. Bruno with a nice visit. Brandon Higgler, Fosma Colomont. I caught. Oh, your herb gel driver. And he lays it home. Now with students. That is just good defense by Bruno Fernando. Bogey stops. Gifts. Murray. Oh, that's a big three. Five seconds. Bogey. Three. Two. Three. Three. Four. Five. Yes. Big shot. And that keeps the hawks in it. For the block size, he was really playing well. And I thought as a team, their defense was excellent. Hunter with a three to start the fourth quarter. No doubt. So, next band up. Beats back in the game. And the three ball is good. Murray has just been on top. And he's got a nice hit in the game. Oh, another turnover by Amorado. Here comes Marshall to lay it in. Marshall only have one time out left. Gisotte Murray gives. Bogey fires a three. Big shot. Another big shot. After the pelican time out, Nigel Marshall gets it in. In the middle of the nance. He gets it over to Zion for the dunk. There is nothing you can do about that. Once he gets it. What did you point for Zion? Murray bottled up. But Bruno is there. Look at him. Deep for three. Got it. We were just talking about life. Good night. I knew him since he was a young kid at Tech. And always been a pleasant guy. And I was like, I'm going to be a little bit more like a young kid at Tech. And always been a pleasant guy. Bogey. Beauty. All of a sudden done. They've got the clippers on Friday night at New Orleans. The team are battling fourth four in Amorado again. 20185. Nance. Count the basket. And a free throw to come. Oh, over to Zion. He's got no off switch on his defense. Bogey. Got another one. Well, he's just a pleasure to watch him shoot the basketball. It's the first of January this year. His third in the NBA. Zion. Oh, man. It's just a freight train coming. 50 left in a blowout game. Pelican still have their starters out there. DJ, putting it in. One away, 94. No. Zion still in there. And he's still dunking. Oh. Oh, he's got a few. Butter. Off the glass of good. Oh, Bella could still double teaming. Coppella, up and in. And two behind Chicago. And the race for nine that gets your home game in the first play in. Basket counts for CJ. 30 seconds left. Five of the shot clock. CJ back it up and training a three on Garrison Matthews. At the end. 116 to 100. Bogey. It's him 25. To end this game. A reverse split. The Hawks won in the Orleans. And the Pelicans win tonight in Atlanta.
