 Well, we have another one. You ready? You game? I'm game. My bad moves are time. I'm game. Who ain't you know yourself? Tatum and Durant doesn't get any bigger than this. Durant had 45 against the Celtics, Saturday and Arizona, and Maxine is first offering. Now on the offensive glass and rebound meeting in general for this sun's team. Saltics are coming up, a five game road trip. It's over on top of three. And no hesitation. In this system. Perfect. Takes a left to the rack. It's a mercantory bound inside. Durant the other way. This is over white. He takes a lot of the rain shot. He makes a 1-2s day in Salt Lake City with a toast grain. It's Durant with a 40 scooping at home. We're talking about one of the gifted scores our game has ever seen. At that size, being able to handle the basketball from three. Yeah. Maybe that's three point shooting season. And just recently two is over 50% from three. The last 23 games, Biel, Maxine and Trey. At the other end, Bradley Biel. 45 inches. Nice pass there by Murr to the top. Trey to the other. Trey to the other. Sons are in 11 games over 500 with a Trey Biel. He is off to a terrific start. Three or four with seven points. Here in the first, the Sons and the Saltics. One, three to hit. Perfect. Miss communication defensively there by Boston. After this and the game against the Seas and the Valley of the Sun Saturday, Trey to the left. It is off to a terrific start with a first quarter point. Soon, houses got the ball. Trey to the move. Met by Durant 3-4. That was a tough start. Right over Durant and right down the hatch. Well, you're gaming at fun. All the great teams do exactly that. They trust each other. He said they're comfortable communicating as they give up an easy bucket to Tadeum. Durant's got 13. Tadeum's got 12. Only two players so far and double figures. The mentality for 30 below the close. And the shots, chess kills are his there. Under two minutes to go, they quickly blitzbroker. Roy Sonia, picked the way back. Richard picked up. Tadeum chased by the Nier. Tadeum's in the lead. Richard teams up the other way. It comes to Roy in the trailer. Richard is a free. See what happens when you give up the ball early. You get it back. Pension pressure. Onion. Bucker. You back. Burt's in Makaray. How would I? How would I? Everywhere defensively. Here comes Durant. Shipping. Richard to put it up in. In. 15 now for KD on 7 of 8 shooting. In a red mess. Chrono got it inside. Thank you. We start the second quarter. White has got it. Beal defense kicks it out. And Xavier Tillman. The newest solid gets in the game. She's in inside. Brown. What a play. Count it with a foul. He's along the record reflexes. He's rotating with the ball. Ends up the beer. And the corner free. Ellen. Good. He's a foul ball and Nirk and cheer. You'll be ball on. Boom to three. Boom. Boom. Pension in. Brown with a three. He's a foul ball. Shot clock at four. Onion. Three. With an other move. He cannot find the distance. A two back up and in. Left up a book of the second all time leading score for the Phoenix Suns. Driving into the paint. To ball. And the corner. The three. You know, when Binyana there was bowl ball, right? He was the first that could be able to do a little bit of every best. Tillman's right. He's beautifully inside. They have the great series of moves. At the best road record in the NBA. 22 and a let us out to be all white closes. We might on three. We might. That was what going October went to Portland played seven games with the Blazers. Suns got him back. He hasn't seen a lot of time to play in tonight on the road. Hartford with a triple and other one for big Al Hartford. No doubt that he can see the trail inside him. Let's roll him away. Three and another one for big Al Hartford. No doubt that he can see the trail inside him. Let's roll him away. Three and another. Jaden Buffle is close. Three over the lead. And pick up the baby right gap. The other way. Four point lead. And three. We go down. Ten of again. Two go against white. Shot clock is at seven. It's Booker in the pitch. Devon Booker with eight. And his five and a half. Austin controls it. Brown outside for three. He's picking up. Very left off. The Suns here. 23 points. And it's Suns up. She's the best 11 games over 500. Beal three hits the deck. Got it to go. Can I get the two brown clutches onto the rebound for the Celtics? It's Tatum to white. They went right into the field. Seven to one. Saturday and Phoenix by ten. Find his sweep of season series. White three. He's from St. Louis. As is Jason Tatum. Durant Allen. Triggers of three. Off it becomes so simple. In the corner. Brown three. Bradley Bill and Devin Hooker were looking for an offensive foul. The official Brian Fortay wasn't having it. The Wolf and traffic stripped of the ball and others are over. The first one. Holiday of three of the five. Tundown Phoenix. Tandem's up front and in the back corner. If he can and Durant hits his first shot and gets his first points since waiting the first quarter. Faced at the bench by Allen offensive. Rebound by Hartford. And down low to go. Royce and Neil off the bench and in the game. The three of the four fourth quarter teams. By now they're trailing by a ton. Hartford tickled. They're one game and back in number five New Orleans. And the rest they get a half-game lead on Dallas. Three booker. It is down on the evening. Sam Hauser's the number five bench player and three points shots made this season. two score. Okay, now someone's foot. And on the other hand, cutting Wayne Wright, trying to slide on Cornette. Out to Roy Sonion. It's on top, but Ray Sam, three is him. Is he newy at time with no defender within three feet of him? Good observation, Brown at the featherweight. Brown continues to score well. 18 with the sons. Shotclack at four. Brown makes some move on the yellow. Is there the need of a move? He's still going to go. Let's see off that bitch. No problem. One of the question marks coming into this season. Nathan Answer. I will put it before you. The goal ball right there. Time out taken by the Surnison. Free goal. Grand Pace has been over this season for the best offensive rating in NBA history. That is amazing. 15 foot shot by Luka. And those are his way inside for two more. And Luka with twenty-three. Brown with a three. Look at this. It's still by Brown. Brown. The shot. Roddy. Roddy has got the rebound. Roddy. We have the division one for four offers in Oscar. Many of them. Final score. The final score. The final score. The final score. The final score. The final score. The final score. The final score. The final score. The final score. The final score. The final score. The final score. The final score. The final score.
