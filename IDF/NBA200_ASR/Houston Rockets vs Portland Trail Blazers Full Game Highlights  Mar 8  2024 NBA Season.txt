 We'll get one more. You ready? You game? I'm game. I'm game. I'm game. I'm game. Who when you know yourself? To learn more. Get my list of try this along with Derek Collins. Bret and Nancell are in position. They got March 2nd half. Flips. They won that one. One 18 to 1. I'm going to step 9. Game losing streak on the road. Green starts off with a heath of Jabari Smith. On the van fleet in transition. Gets an early look and it's six nothing used in the game. Man. Simon's picked up on the switch and it's spiff outside. Defending Simon's quick move on. I'm shifting to his left and nail on the three. This is wide blazers. The rebound here comes to money. Come on, boy. They're going to need him tonight. The lead leaves it over to bat outside and comes to Murray. Side winds into the paint. Attacks the racquet lays it up. Well, 45 and 16. Recently, again, San Antonio and a win. Murray's into the lane off balance with a retainer. Flicks it up and in. So his best luck. Top thank you, Shigun. Coming off the triple double of 23-19. Bored 14 to 6. Laws against the Clippers. Man, it's an outside. Shows his chops from three. Smith, the course, was the third pick in the draft. Coming out of Auburn a year ago. Murray to the baseline. Slinks a pass to bat. Catch, shoot three. Up and in. Then the pairs. Right now. Come on. He got the bar. It's also in a way that the band had transitioned missing the three. Murray, the rebound, goes up and under the flying green. Well, tip. Grab by Brooks. Out in front to pass. Over to Smith. Running right down the center of the court in the gym. Either turnovers or get it off of misses and running. Sign his office screen. The double team late and getting there. I'm with him. Spake this an hour and a half game. Shigun, I got a choice. I got chores at home to take care of. I got to put a foot. Thompson comes down on the board. Shigun, between the wickets, leaves it to Van Leaton. And he flushes the three and Chunchy calls time. What Tom said about the blazer switching specifically when Jabari is in the game as the blazer's double chain going again. See, that's two points that goes the chain going. The anguish of having to repair his old plumbing at home. I'll have somebody do it. And he scores at Sotas Whitmore. That three from straight away. Cam Whitmore shoots. It wasn't good. It's up at Thompson. I have to out my Thompson. Yeah. Both of the top to twins. There are two players. Oh, Moses. Go get that, Moses. What he makes it do you think? I was lying down. That's what I've been out jumping people my whole life. And those two even know their rookies. They will make you start to think twice about well, maybe I should put a body on their first. But the lanus still going past. That's a career. There goes that switching defense from the Rockets. It's down to the head on the back. It's off the terrific two on one down here. Yes. Point blank. No rebound is smithed. Red van bleeding. Run and whip smith at sticks of three in transition. Simon's turn to corner on a screen into the lane to the glass. And lay it in. And for the time we see the last time we saw this. We're all according to Garb if you're wondering what is really up. Richard Goon down low to Green. He slips back door for the two type of game form based on how Houston is playing it. They're giving him a lot of space out there. Sometimes they're switching and they're not getting back to him at time. They're saying Gouryll's patience. Smith quickly peels out of the pack to Brooks Crossport Green catch. Look. Six-eight come on. I'm forced him to dribble. Swords down. And scores. He didn't get a piece. Simon's come. That he's feeling. That's low. And then there's our 11 of 20 from three. Van lead off the screen. And the corner reads it up his Smith. He counters with the triple of his own and uses it. Green. Van reached in. Either tipped in or bothered him. A turn over. Simon's come on in transition. The three got a catch and shoot triple from Tomani. Come on. Welcome back to money. The career high four threes made four of six. Simon's has gotten his rhythm going here. He shoots on this possession. He deep silver bent. Flicks and scores on a three. We'll learn how tough is that. Chris Murray now screen rolling. Finishing in the paint. Van swarms driving into the lead. Goes right at Dylan Brooks and lays it in. Simon's a double screen up top. She good comes up there. Did I hem the pass those? Oh, oh, oh, something. Oh! Cocking rocking and knocking it down. And landed with a pose. Now to man's leave. All poppin. Works. Oh, the board. Green comes up and steps to the class. This is one of the top. Have I thought you might have gone back to back the way Simon start did? In this month, he's got 12 assists to just three turnovers. Eighth four to one assists turnover ratio. Compare that to back in January. Again, more turnovers than assists. Did those Chris again, plain out of the middle? Not all assists to turnover ratios created. Equally, the assist to turnover ratio for Chris. All the team doctors. Always available to help anyone in Blazerland. Outside, they rotate it. Bant the three to beat the clock. Catches iron, can Smith control it he does. Definitely. Now to win. Green. Now top another two hand, Jamesy. Scraps the sky. Here's Bantin now. He has played well. First by getting into the pain. Leeds and uses his size to get up and over. Green working on five. The settle for the three and stuck it. Jim and Green. Start of the game with a couple of threes. 85, 84 count. Green with 19. Used in the lead. Whose pair goes to work? Has it jostled away by Thompson. Swings at a head to green. Another pull up three. Yes, sir. He's got that step out of three. Arcted up short. He gets the rebound, releasing his band. Nobody with him. For the flush. Bags off short. Rebound Thompson. And up the four race. These two nuggets. Thompson right down the middle for the flush. Yeah, the Blazer defender on that left side started to fly out to the shooter. And Matisse, one of the lead's best. And deflected the basketball. Add it again. Whitmore swoops in with a scoop shot. Reef gets a line. The Blazer's getting another offensive rebound in the possession. And the Simon trunters off. They push it ahead. And Thompson has a step on the pack for the two hand jam. Laundale picks it up. And again, used to win the loose fall battle. Laundale winds up on a triple and got it. Oh, that's a back break or sometimes. It gives used to the lead of 11. Talent successful for the rock. Used and balled. Band lead, trailing for three. Red van bleed. Not gonna down. He's joined by Smith. Telling Duopp, watch the post up on that end bounce. The rocket started running. Everybody above the perimeter. No throw it over the top. They don't get that first look here, but that's the look they get. Love the way they, love the way they change side. Yeah, they're working around. Yeah. Shingoo. Fible. Murray. And this man, Delano Bantley will drive it into the lane to the cup to lay it up and end. Good crossover. Go to Billup's wanting to get Brian as many minutes as he can. As he said, he's filled by Brian's development. It's coming along. This Murray, as we look forward to Ryan as he grabs the rebound in his career in years to come. You know, that was not a good pack. No, that's not. Looked it by Grant and Thompson with the hammer. He's gonna get better. Bruce Bant, nothing for. He gets out of the corner races and scores on the triple. Yeah, nice pass from Delano and also he needed to add a little bit of the ball. He needed to ask him to do that because had he not done that, that one rocket defender could have guarded both of the blazers on that left wing. Now when asked the slash to the corner, they got the spacing that Delano needs to deliver that pass. Do you think the guys have any idea how much he volunteer and everything? Moses Brown has the ball. Delano is supposed to be in line to McDonald's tomorrow. As a blazer, and his third year started off with Toronto. I'll play a couple of years there half season with Boston. Thompson got a going away present from Reethwood inadvertently turns a clipped him right in the nose. That will do it. Rockets defeat the blazers here tonight, 123 to 107. The blazers home record out those to eight and 24 on the season. They're over all Mark 17. Thank you.
