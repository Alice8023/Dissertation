 You ready? You game? I'm game. My bad moves are tough. And the top shot locker in the NBA, Collins will try to win the tip that jazz do, sexting the steal. And great hustle by San Antonio to block that shot. You've got to work on your handles. A lot of good exercise. What's up with shot? The prayer answered, where did that come from? T, it was a quick call. Collins sexted. Now it was left. Drives inside. Denied again for the second time by Vicell. Wimbum Yamma runs the floor. Here's Vicell. Triple drive inside to hand it down. Marginal contact. Great blocks. You're right now going on out here, Bolo. Everywhere. They blitz, Wimbum Yamma with sexting the ball taken away on a steal. Big man slow to get up. No look fast. Triple drive to sell. Baseline two handed again. And jazz will look flat footed. Marginal shot clock at 10. Jordan lets it fly. Here are three corners as you talk. Three Jones, Reeves Bounds and not the way. Mark it in a three on one. Take it off. Collins with a two handed. Great defense by Lauri Marken. Not the way. Another steal. The jazz. Getting it done on the defense event. Oh, whatever it was. K, on tape. George. Threats it. Repound. San Antonio. You know, that's a whole different trajectory when you get. Wimbum Yamma's hand in your face. Will Hardy talked about down? We knew him as a defender, but he's really improved on his catch and shoot. Freeze. And he drops one from the corner. There's Clarkson, Walker Kessler, screens marketed. Off the wing. Three. Bam. Beautiful. If executed right, the pick and roll is the hardest play to guard. This league. I like that. You know what? Marketed. Aggressive. He's a shot blocker. Are you still a strong body? Look, it's done. Picks the pocket. Once to run. Space. And hammers at home. Osman. On the drive. Another steal by Dunn. Outlet. Marketed. Beautiful catch. Runs at home. Oh, man. The flicker. The risk. Final shot. Final possession by San Antonio. Outflut. Deep three. Got it. They see a 24 points. And. A rebound to San Antonio. Just after Christmas, some of the fucking drugs. Down in San Marqueted. Down at 29%. But you know what, these shooters keep shooting. They do keep shooting. It's easy if a Jordan one. The defense is great. To the team. On the lead. They see on that step back. Oh, what a shot. It was his first bucket of the half. Their sense of awe. You know. That's what the thing. You have a part of his game. Still developing his own defense of it. That's what hard he talks about. And working on both sides of the ball. Random in the paint. I think Walker got a piece of that. Random try to go into time. The rebound they see somehow deflects the path. The way he goes. The way he goes. The way he goes. The right hand. Random in the pain. I think Walker got a piece of that. Random tries again this time. Finns of ball. The Reban. They see somehow. Reflex the past. Saxton. Hendrix. Oh, yes. 1530. Jazz by 20 here in the first half. Inside Walker. Nicely done. Step through. The two defenders. 13 for Clarkson. 13 for marketing in the first half. That's what. When the Niyama does it does well. Florida. Right now. You can tell as Brandon knocked down his 10th point at a quarter. What the jazz can't do is settle for outside shots. Now they win this back of the game. Wesley. Smooth shot. We love the energy he brings. Even when he's not hit a lot of shots. He's really moved before well. Wind and Niyama. Parks drives. Passes off the section. Somehow got that ball. The common inside glass. Come on. I did. That's a 10 the hard way. 10 point first half. Great Jones front court. I have a feeling. Windy's going to be a center piece of this all messing right there. Left hand flying. Pass it out to Hendrix. Right baseline. Nice. Nice baseline move and drive. And Taylor Hendrix. We're trade Jones. Two threes. Piazza. Nice. Little head bit. And then drive. There's a free fall at the moment. Champ penny from the corner. Up and out. The tap. Rolls up and in. Look the switch on the jazz. You thought led by 24. That least been cut to 15. Why don't we jump college with a hammer. And a foul. The triple team. The big man. The cell drops a triple. The cell with 15. Well, front away. Sexing. No one's going to catch you. The ball. Horns out. Fries in. That was awesome. Head down. Pass comes right back. I think. Tacey. Very triple. Jazz trying to snap a five. He ain't losing. String him. Not once. It's a great deadline. One bouncing in. The cell now. There's Collins. Three. Good. That Collins. Wild, the easiest puppet of the night. A vision. Jazz. Give it away. They try to force it into marketing. Here comes Chris Depp and another steal. The top JC rifles a pass. Mark it in. But. 6.5 rebounds. Give it go inside. Custard got it. It wasn't going to go out. No, it wasn't going to go out. No, it wasn't going to go out. Clarkson stop and go dry. Stop and go dry. Left hand. Spin right. What a pass. What a pass. Clarkson took the right coach for the right player. He said something great. Players develop under him. There's a triple knock down by the cell. Yeah, that's just desire. Yeah, you. Depends is not well out of players. World on in all season. The fact that we need to do what he does. I think some of the chemistry in your team. But. We'll see. We'll see how they can come together. Best to see. But. Walker looks out shot. That's how you beat the big man. By the way, the Hawks did lose tonight. Tour Lando. Oh, my foot. Put together by San Antonio. Under nine and a half to play in the 95 84 game. Jasmine outscored 10 to make it 10 to five. The cell leaves the pass out front. Drive it. Score. And time out after the random bucket on the break. Eight minutes left. The cell. On the elbow. Right now they've been outscored by nine. Marked and drives inside out. It goes to Clarkson left hand dribble. Stop and go. Stop it. Pop it. Jump or do it. Do it. You're going to be able to get the ball out of the 20-23 grabs. That's what it's all about. Right. You're going to be able to get the ball out of the fly. That's 15 for Collins. And Utah has now hit 13 to 30 for downtown. Still in. Marked it. He has Collins on his shoulder. Up it goes. And scores it. Sexton. Black. Marked it. Been a Black Party all my wrong. How about that's good pass. Can't take one more time. Clarkson from the corner. 11-0 is the run. Until that bucket. Sexton surveys. Uses the gut. John Collins. Green. Collins jumps it from three. Got it. He has just 149 percent from behind the yard. High pick and roll. Collins easy. Remember. Just past three minutes remaining. And a 121-102 lead. Utah trying to break out of a five game slide. And that will help as Marked it. He's handling the graphics as always. That's a special moment. Teacher of mentor. Popovich. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
