 You ready? You game? I'm game. Showing improvement, right? They've already won three games, then they won all more than they won all the last season. So they have progressed. They've just hidden a little bit of a bump in the road here. Let's see if they can shake out of it here tonight. Red fan fleet in year number eight in the NBA. Putting up outstanding numbers and he's just put up a silky smooth jubber. I'm going to shot five. That's another thing this rocket's been there starting to increase the pace with which they play here this season for breast. Get a snap, Sinnoh, jump shot. They went showing some aggression here early. Green had a block by Hungren. He's averaging 2.6 per game. Hungren, showing off the handles. Pick up by Smith, Hungren fades, connects. Diagonal feed, Gidey. Not going to take the three instead drives in and the flip is good. We've listed at 6.5. Green. D9. Hungren there to suffocate him. Here's Tori. And that's blocked by Shanggu. They lead Houston by one. Shengu in on a kick. Extra. Smith. Hot potato. A three. That was a really good possession. One of the first time they attacked. I think that's great stuff, Jared. And there's no doubt about it. A lot of it is not just what he's done statistically. It's about empowering his teammates. And the fact that they've been able to elevate to the very elite of our league. Especially coming from a small market where they don't get as much attention nationally as some of the elite gold fans. Right on the tee, you're able to knock down that triple. For the Rock, it's really kind of the tone setter for them defensively. Hard drive, the pull-up. It's dancers and goes through. Impressive handles. Guilda Salixander has got the height advantage on Van Ville. Uses the body. And hits. He's just so patient. Aaron Wiggins in the game for OKC. So he goes deep. Whitmore. Got a three. He's impressive. And Vickery. Coffinant. Holiday has a screen from Green. Uses it. Explodes to the rim. Holiday gets the juice. And that's because of the space. He's seven-oh-run for the Rockets. Four seconds to play in the quarter. Double team, Guilda Salixander. Wiggins makes his move. Push it up and in at the horn. The Baker goes for Aaron Wiggins. Shenguin Smith, Thompson Whitmore, and Holiday for Houston. Hongram with a downtown hit. Plays with such passion. And that step in three made it look very natural and easy. Shenguin in a crowd. Whitmore off the heel. Tiptoe Thompson's got hops. Well, that's what coach Edoka talked about, right? Over to Holiday. The drive hangs, missed it with the offhand. Wall is pushing the pace. Right down the middle. Wall is gives it up. Hongram rocks the rim. 33-33-9-25 to go. First half. Smith, the length. Got it to go in a foul. And if you're the Rockets, that's what you want to see. And I think as he matures and gets more confident. I think you're going to see him look to take more of an initiative. Offensive. Nine points for Jamari Smith. The jumper from Williams. Bottoms. And Williams already taking that initiative. He is tied to 37. Then lead circles. Kick. Green. Got him. A three. Yeah, that's a... Get it back. Joe. High pass handled by Williams. Fixed out Shenguin. Strong to the rim for Jalen Williams. Right now it's green matched up with Hongram. Williams comes to the ball. They switch. Fire. And hit. Jalen Williams. Perfect from the outside. Every time I see him, he impresses me. Tap the ball to himself. It's said the possession here for Houston. Trying to take the baseline. Give it up. Brooks lays it in. Tremendous blind feed from Alparence Shenguin. Under three minutes to go. First half. Dork with a purpose. Side steps. Kick out. Jumper Williams. Got it for Perry. Young man. And you can tell, D is got a tremendously bright beat. Gildes, Alexander. Nails it from the outside. Van Fleet, feed it. Nine to Shenguin. Next away. Williams with the steal. And the lay in goes. And to end action. For OKC. So Houston gets a reload here. Brooks. Drive fade. Bottom. They needed that basket in off a second chance. And that's what he's been able to do with the veteran leadership that they brought in. Homegrown on the reverse rack attack. It's stayed to the game. OKC. Shenguin. Big finish. And the foul. Right back at you. Shenguin. No luck. Died. Homegrown. Dune. Nacka in there. Jambari. Smith Jr. Dork. Finally. Three. Seven-three-six-six-seven. Thunder. Shenguin. Isolation. Double team. Shenguin feeds it out. Green. Chuck. Shenguin. I like the patience there. Three-point lead for the thunder. Three-point lead for the thunder. Three-35 to go in the third. SGA. It's clever. He is so good. Second unit on the floor for OKC. Other than, shake Gilges Alexander. Wallace drives and finishes. It's a seven-point lead for the thunder. Stop and go. Green loses it. Williams gets it ahead. Gilges Alexander. He's going to be back. OKC, Aaron Halliday now for Houston. Gilges Alexander. Step back three. Bulls high. And he will be the trigger man with 53 seconds to go in the third. Gilges Alexander fires and hits. Always at his pace. Shenguin. He's going to be back. He's going to be back. Always at his pace. Shenguin watching from the bench. Hongren back in for the thunder. Tend to shoot. Turn around. Nice touch from Jabari Smith Jr. He gets the matchup with Shenguin. They help from Halliday. Skip pass. Wiggins. The bounce. Hongren. Push out in and out. Swam down. On the follow. He wasn't boxed out. Player, that's when I'd like to see you. Not allow Hongren to be that close to the basket. The bounce. Jailin Williams. Mr. Automatic. Extending the lead. 92-76. Thunder. Whitmore on a control. Didn't turn it over. Green is there. Give it up. In a crowd. It goes for Smith. And the foul. Back in by the Maryland product. Turn fires. Wrems out. Swim down. Hongren with another hammer jam. 15 point lead. Giddy. Beautiful bounce pass. Avrilyum's rocks the rim. Break through the legs and Williams controls. Hongren, lob it up. Swam it down. Gordon Hayward. Off the special delivery from Hongren. Hongren, homer, homer, five assists for our none better. Jailin, one on one with Williams. Ball fake. Ten to shoot. Jailin Goon. The spin to the rim. Yeah, good patience there by Jailin Goon. You're not going to see that very often. And you talked about those rocket shooting numbers. Green. Sky Walker. Finally got a matchup with Howard. He could take advantage of. Right from a defensive standpoint. They created some problems. I like what they're doing in Houston with this point. Staggill, just Alexander. Jailin. The bucket. He's been out of the rotation for Houston. 112 to 92. Final 50 seconds. Jumper goes for a holiday. Coming up next. That's honestly right. Lost in the second round. He's going to be back to the next year. Other than 165 and one on the one at 10. He's it. So you had never known.
