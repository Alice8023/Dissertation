 And I'm really looking forward to see how his guys are going to answer and come out here and play aggressive. Look at the end of the day. There's always still something that you're playing for. Campella, move claxid. Here's Bridges. Skimmer, Johnson. It's a three. That's good to see Camp Johnson kind of get going early. You have enough talent in my opinion to go out there and get this victory versus the Hawks. That shouted at 26% from long range against Orlando. He'd have 31. Hurry with a pretty move going to the rim. Here's Bridges picked up by another Villanova. Stand out to deep bay. Claxid, drive and kick. Johnson, let's apply. It's a triple. No trade, young, is that he's going to be aggressive. But the aggressiveness probably looks very different than when you have trade young on the floor. The set up of Donovan should Campella, who slams it down. Truder. Six-ack. Johnson, hot hand. Yes sir. Another three. It's the types of shots that players are being able to shoot and knock down that are different than at the past. That's getting multiple chances here. Bridges treats it from the outside. That's a by 11. Chances to add to it here. Truder gets into it quickly. Bridges catching fire. Time out. Quinn Snyder in the Hawks. Just passed a halfway point of this opening corner. Murray pull up. It's tough. But offensively they do miss something from his grace. Bridges short rebound. Sharp put back against the bounce. Walker, great one on one talent. Truder trying to save it underneath the basket. Control by the Hawks. Murray's got the angle. Little shimmy shake to the rim. Time out. Kevin Oli. Wait for his teammates. And now they'll settle in here with 3-13 to go in the first. Truder. Over Johnson. He's got it. Johnson got body five for Nando. Extra. Bridges. Count it for three. Don't mess up my system. We're going to triple double here. That's every player of just you. It's most players. Hunter. Good looking jump shot from Deon. Oh, Pup get head shoulder fake. High off. They've got time. Five seconds. Smith peaks the clock. Leaves it for Johnson. Two seconds. One second. Johnson. Swarves the down. Big finish. Where he stands. That would put them on a 2-week left in the regular season. Johnson hard drive and stuff. From Shalant Johnson. Johnson surveys. Poked away by Walker. Break opportunity. Low pass. Walker trying to handle it. And he's forced to retreat against Fernando. A three. Walker snaps it in. You're able to calm down and still go get up the shot. Pup get handles the first wave of defenders. Now we'll fire it over. Clashed it. It's a long two pointer. Toe on the line. Shot clock is winding down. Murray trying to make it happen. Bounce it. Copella kick. Pupkin. Cans a triple. Kobe buffkin with a shot clock. Nothing run for the hawks. Out of the timeout. Hand off to Bridges. Tend to shoot. A jumper. Denish. Rooters. Splash. He said that has to do. Probably. That's a look by ten. Pupston hard drive. Swaping move from Nick. Blackstone with the finish. Bridges crosses. Flokes. Missed. Crap by Murray. That's trying to get back defensively here against the hawks. Murray. Great hand. If I had the point to one thing to net, look at. Shoot the ball. Welcome three. The guy has started getting down. He'll only two three throws so far. He has his first half. Shooter gets the shooters rolling. He's got the gun. He's a bit. Inside. Cahela lay a good in a foul. Johnson gets his hands on it. Controls from Brooklyn. Feed the post. Diagonal. Shooter. Nice fake. Shooter. High on the window. He put major. He's the third net and double figures with ten. Hand off. Bridges. Drives it in. Kicks it out. Johnson. Got a three. Shooter. Peaks at the clock. Three to shoot. Mixers move on Johnson. Flips it up. Brims in. Circus shot for Shooter. 50-3-44. Murray. Six to three. Straight away, Jay. Easy at multi-time all-starring the right situation. 100%. Fitty Smith. Back out. Johnson. Bulltie. Cam Johnson. Fitty. Johnson. Bulltie. Cam Johnson. These are the games that you have to win, especially when you look at that upcoming schedule. If you can go four and one in that situation, now you're in the mix, now you're playing for something. Bridges, the fade is good. That's a good one. Johnson, big first tap with 18 points, trying to drive in on Johnson. Kick. Fitty Smith. Seven to shoot. Johnson turns the corner layup. Shooter, four to shoot. Against a really good defender, Murray. Shooter gets space and hits the high-arker. The net's up by 10. Johnson lines it up. Cam Johnson. It's a three. That's lead by 11 bucked out of it. It's the hard drive and shields with one arm to finish with the offhand. I see your block. You're the best. You're the best. You're the best. Thanks, Rast. There's Johnson, hard drive. And he adjusts, versus the range that he has on that pass. They tried to swipe it for Murray. Instead, he sticks the turn around. Bridges, no one. Johnson. Swing. Shot clock winding down. Shooter. Three. Ball movement. Fitty Smith. Pick the by-bay. Shark shows. Johnson is cooking. Killed it. And a foul for Cam Johnson. That's on the move with Shooter. Johnson, give it up. Shooter, does he have the hot hand? Yes, sir. Tennis Shooter. That's eruptive. 50% from the field. Swing time here for the rookie Wilson. Smith pull up hot. Nylon. Buffkin back in for the hogs. He was effective at the first half coming off the bench with seven. Jumper is smooth from Bogdanovich. Bogdanovich. Buffkin. Short. Long rebound. Base steps in for Bogdanovich. Lips it up and in. Bogdanovich. A minute 14 to go on the third. Bogdanovich. Accelerates. It finishes. Tomato tomato. Buffkin. To the right. Five to shoot. Smith has to hurry. The drives. Nice fake. The window. The kiss from Dennis Smith Jr. Lead feed for Smith. Give it up. Fishes. It's a big blow. The ball. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Fridgez. A ball. Good. Good. Welp. Birchz. Boit. A bread. A этих HOVParades. woj Dej natives. Ba gebek. Offs soak the pitches. Five. Ops. chest. Three. Cartier. Get the goon down the table. The spring rolls. 40 booze. Evey. Opsiz plays for the trigger. The spring rolls. One bird. One bird. One bird. Three.ranferow. the pressure thing in the defense by Dennis Smith. Ascent. Trumps in the tremor. It's a 15 minutes very efficient off the bench. Back door. Climb down. For the post game, that's the end of the game. What you say, we, I always find that interesting. Another jumper goes. Fourth time in team history, they've done it at home. Cappella ball fake, sped and bucket. 15. Very tough move by Murray contorting his body in a chance at a three point play. 20 to 95, Brooklyn. Fake the handoff, Watford crosses and spins it in. 124 to 97. The fall.
