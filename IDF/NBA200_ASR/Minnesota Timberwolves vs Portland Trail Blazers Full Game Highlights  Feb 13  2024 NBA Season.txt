 I used to be back in the old days. Yeah, but one hit in America for 78 days. Well, that's been the Minnesota Temple of this year. They can ill afford a hiccup here tonight in Portland. The Blazers hope it to upset them. The first quarter brought to you tonight by First Tech Federal Credit Union, the Fisher Credit Union of the Blazers. Visit FirstTechVed.com slash Blazers to learn more. All right. Good start for the Blazers. Yes, break it down and defense. What? This has a real limiting effect on this team. Here's Edwards spinning into a turnover. Simon's up the floor. Ming wants five McDaniel switches. Look to right hand. Leason in a transition. Brilliant. Blame by Simon. Yeah. Kick out of that and find Conley. Ball jabbed into the air by Grant, recovered by Conley. Scooped Edwards. He's boys. He fires the three in scores. Double screen for JG. Bit of a stagger. He didn't like the look right away. Gave it some at ease. Here come the wolves and numbers. Conley with a pick two on one down and hit on. And no flutter one up in it. Come on. Indeed. Loves it at that foul line on the elbow. That's where he lives. One of the best. By Simon Jessica. Anthony old 10. The last time these two teams met, McDaniel was a reason why the Niggles Anthony don't take me right out of it. Lobo. Yeah, he's quickly forgotten that. Oh, yeah, here's go bear into the lane going lefty over. Good pressure, but an adjustment by go bear. Want to see them up and down the floor. Bring young talent next generation of the NBA. Anderson a step back. Go bear high screen. Above the art Edwards hesitates. Zigzag dribble. Fire is over eight in scores. It's a good defensive play because I thought school did the right thing there. He celebrated before going into the shot. Mike Conley. Eight one oh one. Step back. He eats and scores with a soft touch over go bear. Yeah, he got a lot of space on his pin. We barely have a little friendly banter before him. Bantan is in for the blazers. He is six nine third year pro. He is defending. Good job from Jeremy after the switch. He just in right behind a defense in that open area. Everybody thought Edwards was going to pull. No, that mental tick tocks says I still got a little time. I'm going to dribble drive. Blazers 10 eight bench advantage. Blazers. Minnesota already with four steals. Here's a lob inside from Anderson to seven one go bear for the flush. I beg your pardon. I'm going to six nine point man distributing. Okay, Anderson. Here's Henderson jam right over. Up the lane to land up an end. That was a forceful. He comes into the picture. Try to sweep it by. Can't find. Bantan for three. And the guy shoots 25% from three with Bantan. Shuffle his feet across the timeline. Cross it over zigzag. Good. Nice take right to the rack to lay it in. Andy is foul. Simon's advances. Bantan into the lane. Climes into the year. Good strong delivery. Got by Walker. Volley by Reeves twice and flixing it with a left hand for the bucket. It was a whole lot of good basketball being played. Go screened for effort. Well, I'm at that opportunity and go bear with it. Pick him up. We worked his lines. Anderson checks the clock backstab on Simon's and scores on a roundhouse post. Took his time just to get to a spot. He knew six nine eight dribble handoff. Simon's snakes have passed back to eight in the scoring zone for a bucket. That was a really nice pass. Anthony. As soon as he came home. Tip one by Minnesota. Edwards ahead his team zigzag. Brooklyn to a spin back up in score and a foul. Anthony Edwards double-tank. Get it out of his hand if they do. Go bear. Fixed to a slithering, lobbing Alexander Walker on a time to go bear for the flush. Here in the bottom. Spines combo. The backs up to get it sets his feet between the wickets left to right and right to left your own for the old bag. And then the pose. Because we've seen games like at New York. He blocked Julian's Randall shot. So many time Julian's gravel goes over the closed bullet as it knocks out a three. And said who is this can? Because you just what you put it out is correct. Go bear has such a high defensive IQ that other big guys aspiring to be what he is. And watch his film. He's got a little bit of space to operate with. Drives it inside around. How so can we go bear? Snaps in the board and pumping it right back in with the left hand is the Andreate. Another really good year. We got it done. We got it done. On the attack. Towns clears out and a good slumber. That's what Anthony Slimes did on that week's time. Right there. Help prevent and offensive rebound for the table. Towns explores the pain. Draw two defenders. It's looked out by go bear. Grab by Edwards. He means over the edge. Ripple. Suddenly will pull on the tree. That's big time. Lana Banton. They're going to run at a wing now with Henderson. Simon's at the guards. Eight in the middle. It grand on one of the other forward. And then he's going to be able to get the ball. And then the guard's. Eight in the middle. It grand on one of the other forward positions. Simon's a three. Nothing but net before McDaniel's against Andrew. It's wasting. McDaniel's a quick top of the three. It's off. Simon's pitches in the corner. Grant waiting. Four three. Knocks the down. There's so many times where you just need him to run to distract the deepens. Get the ball balanced. We're not going to go out to you. We're going to JG about that hand. Big man. Keep running. We need you. Inwards. Working on the go-beer screen. Henderson forcing him over to eight. And he splits a pair into the lane to the glass, lay it in. Beautiful diagonal from Edwards right to the cup. Over towns and a spores for the recovery. Suner eights. Cut off by Henderson. Trailing is cat. The one two to the cup for the slam. And then see the inner guy. He must have rode his ankle somehow on that drive. Good cut Delano. Quick and bounce Delano. Banton, the bucket and the foul. So, Chelsea, the last time up, would bend at a wing. And so, read on the attack. A high bounce. They got away. Again, they go in. They back. They fall easy. Good move from Mausreet. Fakes a little bit. And with my colleague at Delano, Delano will be able to shoot over the top of them. If it comes to that. Oh, scoop does a great job to draw. Go bear out and just beat him to the baseline. So now the stellar play makes sense. Banton on the attack. Loms it up. Tom Aiden feels it and frees it with two hands. Those are the shape. Kill just out. Example. Foot pass. Anderson Reed. Look out. Broken coverage. Read a two hand jam with nobody near. For the Blazers and Henderson. 14 and night. Speaking of playmaking. And pretty silence. Looking for his teammates on the end bounds. It's unfortunately Edward steeling from Henderson. And pro bowl of the screen. I was looking up on the floor and I thought that was just you talking. It was just me talking. Oh, it wasn't broken. We're just here talking tomorrow. That's what we do. That's how it goes. Stop it enough. You and me. How about Edwards tonight? You know. Your second guessing yourself at times. And that's one of the hard parts about that job sitting in that chair. You have a lot of bubble. Yeah, go to the left. Off glass. Off the move. They have that combination. There's just some teams out there that can really make life. It should be difficult on you as Edwards gets another bucket. I believe as things get closer they can sign up for it. If you look out later on and Sacramento is in the West as the top of finals. I hope it's not. This bench will be coaching the Western Conference All Stars. We'll see him again on Thursday. 121-109 final. Minnesota goes to 38 and 16 on the year. 19. 19.
