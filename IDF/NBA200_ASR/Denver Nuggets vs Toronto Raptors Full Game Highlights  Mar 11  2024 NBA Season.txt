 You ready? You game? I'm game. About the focus of the Denver Nuggets in the first five minutes here. The Nuggets can pull the tap, Tyler Ford. That's how the Toronto Raptors are going to look to score though. Getting seals, getting out and running fast-trick situations. The Nuggets are going to burn his first dunk of the night. And the Nuggets lead in. In some way, shape or form. You'll get your Gordon that connection is next level. Now, a limit who's a good three-point shooter. Good outside shooter period. He knocks it in three points when they announce the additional players out to them. Can confirm not an error. RJ Barrett throws it down. So, six five. Now Gordon. Gordon inside. He's just, wraps on the road this year. Just 10 of 22. As Olenek hits the triple. Okele Olenek off to a here in the first quarter. I'm just trying to find an inspiration. Bossy is in in the quarter. Gordon, Gordon, running for the Revenant. Aaron Gordon. First time he has played against his brother Michael Porter, Jim here. Yoke is passing a good, oh, look at Gordon. He went for the river. Opportunity said Katie, would you after we listen to the head coach? Yoke is with the deflection. Richie's got it. Can a jam one for us? Yeah. Yeah. You talked about it Chris. And holy Yoke is another person. He's won the leading mid-range in the NBA. Centered to it. 58%. Barrett. Round the goes. Bossy. Yoke's out of the last six. Now, dump it in. Yoke is battered away. Bad pass. Now Brady did. There she was three. And Nailie. So, the caravan's loose ground guarded by the river. Chris, you were. Bruce, wrong three. And he nails it. So the Raptors are. Christian is made. And of his last, the lead shots in the last three games. In a fire of three. Got it! Get that, Hastings. Given the way that they started against the Utah Jazz, they're only down by two points. So it's a competitive game obviously, but there's some things that the Nuggets definitely need to lead up, including second chance points. The two. Go back for Bruce. Go back for Bruce. Go back for Bruce. Go back. Man, the steal. All right, McDaniels has been a hit. So far. How about that? Jalen McDaniels put three bounce for McDaniels. Barrett's for three and the Raptors are all over the Denver Nuggets right now. Brown lay it up and in. Let's do. When Bruce Brown, two within the flow of Denver's office. War. Good defense. And nobody caught him out of the weak side. Barrett gets away making threes. Remember, there's no greater duo in terms of passing to Aliuk. Yokech and Gordon. Our Jake Barrett. Now the three is good by Raw. In the corner. So Freeman Liberty got the ball. Yokech draws the ball. And the four, Richie Jackson from three. Look, it's Camp B. Here, Yokech. Look, it's in. Yokech with it again. Inside, surrounded. Yokech. Check Gordon new lays it in. Yokech just in time. And Eric, where's he going? Find it and he's going to make it. Ready, Dick. Side step. And hits a tough three with all well past 12 points. So does Gordon's order with 11. But the ninth back court has not scored tonight. Murray and KCP both scored. And by Barrett, they double. Murray, good luck. Next hit. Looks like, hey, we're going to double Yokech. We're going to double Murray. Pass the ball. So you're going to fire a three. And then, the three. And then, the three. And then, the three. Pass the ball. So you're going to fire a three. That's nine seconds. You can backstab Brown. They double. Murray. Very long range. And he knocks it in. Brown goes out. I'm Chris Marlow, the wakiti. When do you heard from Scott Hastings? Yokech, for the cast. Three of knocks it in. K-dick. Let's bounce our step, man. That's good. Nice three points shooting. Has to approve this 18-percentral ball. Letting drop sit in. I'm counting on him on a school Toronto with a lead. And he's getting overcome a 20-point deficit against the Republicans. Give it to Yokech. And look, it's going to be good. 17. And so, Murray, yes, NFL. Here in the third, or maybe a quarter-four. The Linux, he is just working over the nuggets. And now it's like on the loan. Brady, Dick, way out. And we're down. Both of them. A little basket counts. Follow on Yokech. Hey! Hey! And Yokech's the block. KCP on the run. Hellio. That's a good point, Jeff. And again, that's what he bought. If you're done with the office, that's a shot that he usually makes. Why it opened up with a budget? And a boss, he puts it in. They're wet. The wreck was at energy. Bring the heat. They have to have that spark drop the bench. It's a Murray and Murray, he's up for the end. Yokech's coming back in. And on the other side, he's up for the end. Spin cycle activated. Go. And away top. Stolen! Yokech! Over to Murray. He sets. He fires. He gets the triple. He's left it. Yokech again. Give it to Brown. Christian, Yokech, come on in. No, come on in. No, come on in. Come on in. Yes! He fired 86. Now, Barry, snap it into corner. Corner again. Yeah. John tape. Corner. Can't leave him open. Trying to get the final score here. They're down by seven. There'll be two man game. Seven to shoot. Reggie, come it in. Lay it up in. There you go. I'll just can they get a little closer now. Reggie, on the dribble. Lay it up in. The gate's open. It's not like, you jackson, you can see he's playing with a little different path of his step. Soon here. Now in the lane. And the bucket counts on a foul. The nuggistly, late rotating. He's up here. Interesting. The linux very physical. Payton Watson steps into a three. Yes! Today, this call will pull his mysteries only three shots tonight. Maybe he can get going. Murray. Good set up in. How beautiful play by waiting to come back in. Should be fairly soon. One pass by Murray off the bounce. And Nazitha. One on seven, one on four now. Murray by his men. And the basket counts and a foul. So the nuggists have a chance. That's nearly traveled. Coming in. What? You'll get your pie. Murray's got it. Murray on the run. Down the middle. And put away. Now here we go. It's 19 to 9 here in the fourth quarter. 61-40. And a good play by Abazhi getting inside. Toronto to score a single pass break one after a long 15 in the first half. It's Murray's clock there. Now Murray and Yokech to make a game. Murray. Got it again. He's in his own. Covenant win before they get out on the road for four to roll. Miami is next up. Barrett in the lane. Wheels and scores it. Shoot. I'm going to get it back from Yokech. Murray against a limit of an under-school. Laugh is good. 26. Yokech. 35. 16 and 12. Murray. Pass it out. KCP for three. Get it. Yes. Says it. 1-21-1-15. KCP, hidden in his first three at the perfect opportunity for the Denver Nights. Rappers have it. Murray's tired. Or Ty Rina should say Barrett in the lane. That's good. Yokech against a limit. They double. Murray sling it over the corner. Michael corner. Junior. Such a heads up. Now gets a record of streak to season series from Toronto. And the Rappers there. Four straight loss. The Denver Nights. 22 and four. Again, sub five hundred.
