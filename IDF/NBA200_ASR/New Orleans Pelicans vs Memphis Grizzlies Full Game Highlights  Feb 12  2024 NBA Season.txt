 And Joe Ingalls missed a last second potential game winner and the tip won by the pelicans. Glad you were with us wherever you may be throwing another log out in the fire in state of the game. I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls, I'm Joe Ingalls. Which I really think those candidates and those candidates must look forward to your thinking. Herb Jones hits another three. Herb Jones, 41% from beyond the arc. It's the downside of her life so heavily on two-way players. Vince, a three. It's through over Vince William Schoen here. Free throw shooting is where they drop off a little bit. But they average a plus four point differential per game. A Jaren corner three is through. The Grizzly three of it from downtown. He's always using his feet to be in the tag ball. Vince Hatchard was a knock away. I'm looking at the off-dommout. Drop off Vince, reverse layoff is in. The one thing that Grizzly want to continue to do, you know I say good move here by Jaren. Yes, the smell against Beljudis. That's two on the honors. I don't see them coming. Herky jerky dribbling style. Nice drop off here. Hatchard picked two. Another double figure, first quarter for Jaren. Four game offensive slump of averaging fewer than 10. But big against trailblazer. Oh, that's a good pass. Hatchard to finish. Vince Williams Jr. had eight assists against Charlotte. Canard, Jaren, Conchar, Aldama, and Vince Williams. They played a total of 45 minutes together. Ingrid, cutting back door. Wades out Conchar. The second set for Beyond the Arden. A look ahead to Ingrid. Sends it away to Murphy for three. And Murphy responds. With a three in his own. Train Murphy to third. Honestly, this season, they will get the 28th. Alvarado splashes a three. Jose Alvarado. Zine against Stevens. Drop off extra pass. Alvarado back to that freeze. Jose Alvarado. Canard, uncover it. Four, three, two, one. Canard, two for two. From downtown. Canard. Alvarado, the rebound. Loft, Resiah, and the foul. Two gone by, second quarter. Stevens spins and hits the fade away. The light Steven rebound, Jemisin. Kippin, I'll pull up three. Thank God. Scotty, Midman, Jr. And not making an easy layup attempt. Kippin, another three. Good again. Scotty, Midman, Jr. from downtown. 23 bench points already for the pelicans. They average 33 games. Alvarado, Stevens. The rack attack off is set up by Midman. This game is being shown in Japan with Japanese commentary and Leo. Mr. Color Tiger, step through by Midman. So he's been around winning programs. That got deflected and stolen. Perfect. A look of half hurt Jones, and a slam. Ingram. Rebound Jared. There's a dip. You got another telegraph pass. Agram, a walk up three. What's it at? Rebound Williams. Grizzies only two offensive rebounds tonight. In the color for three. This is the second field world of the game. Top 16 in deflecting's per game. Ingram Flutter, yes. They needed him to step in and the way that they have. He's talking about Scotty, Vivian Jr. He's a pro-rated. Situation for him is, can our knockdown referee? Helikins 28 and 9 when they lead in intermission. Grizzies this 8 and 26 when they trade up. Williamson. That's how he's among the league leaders and layups made. They'll at least make a move towards the person that's moving through. Right. You can't just get it. It's not enough. Dance with a throwdown. Not because of Brevon Night? Yeah, it's not. Well, what's the liar when I got there? Well, what do you think about, you know, let me use that. A veteran Caesar rookie like, could I have your number? Right, 16 pick it out of you. I'm surprised. Vince on a drive against her younger versus it up and in. Rebound her Jones. Vince with a knock away, but Ingram is able to recapture. Her Jones got all the way to the cup. Ingram. Really great. Done a good job of getting through to them. How to use their hands and passing lanes. Jaren, walk up three. Tank up. And Grizzies still stuck. I too off into rebounds. Tonight. Getting dominated on the glass. Her Jones. Places his third, three of the game. Canard, corner three. Tank up. Blue canard, four of eight. Jaren off the exchange with Pippin. This is the three Pippin tips the rebound, but there's her Jones. And Ziya the flush. Another Grizzies timeout. He's shot at him by McCullough. Steven's gone strong in the rack and put it in up and in. The higher Steven. I don't know what I'm going to tell James. He wants to see here. He's got a little bit of life and energy for the Grizzies teams. Nice move. How about the bar, Steven? There's some life and energy. Where he's at, 10-10 on the block. On the one hand. Straight by Jamison. Steven slips through. Ball line. Or a zander by jumper. He's in. Watch it out. Flopminabi. Nice, Jamison. The most group is Gimettaylor Jenkins, what he's looking for. A little bit of bounce, a little bit of juice. Jamison. Nice, pretty play. Shot fuck down to five. Ziya knocks it away. Jamison. On the Jamison under deflection again. Got it back. Beautiful three. Bang go. You to one, now, man. There's a whole bunch of long way. That's Jamison alone. He goes at Balanchunis. Blanc it up. Blanc. And Tray Jamison. Why not? But we've seen it work on the hook shot. Jamison. You to size advantage against the column baseline jumper. It's in for you to win. And that will be a turnover. Murphy. Wadadabit. Around the screen. Balanchumberg. Got it. You to Wadadabit with nine. Jiren. Got the step against Dan. Back to Dan. Something. Ball fake. Oh my god. Back to Dan. They are standing in the next corner. The Grizzies from 25 down. Final five minutes. Margin within five. That's where we are now. Shot clock down to three for Abram. A-Grip packing down. Three to eight. Jumper is in. Defeat the shot clock. And the pelicans needed that in the worst way. The pelicans are struggling with our partner. They become very individualistic. And he's in the game situation. Which he by chance. A lot of you. We talked about that at Malzik. Yeah. A-Grip. Good again. Money for your brand in England. The big difference. Dance. Hunter of Jenkins. With 11 Lamar Stevens with 10 and 8 boards. Off the bench, Drejemason. Six. You
