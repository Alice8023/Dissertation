 You ready? You game? I'm game. The Westman just spectacular for the Celtics. She'll jump against Harkstein. Austin also won seven in a row on the road. Whereas the Dixie have been a good road, good home team. They're 19 and 8. A Chua is on Jaylen Brown, the first three-pointer on the night is Kurt. They tip more threes. Missing is as Lisa said, the 11th straight game. Porzinga gets inside. Well defended by Harkstein, although Porzinga thought he was hit. Brunson steps into a three. It's to start. Porzinga is being guarded by Deven Chenzone. Now gets some help from a Chua. An off-balance shot is good. He's completely... They'll play five times because of that quirk and the schedule from the in-season tournament. Brown rattles in another three-pointer. Relax and breathe into it a little bit, Jay. When you're confident you can manipulate the game and get your shots. It's amazing how different things are. Brunson knocks down another. Both teams. Hark chasing Tatum. Harkstein picks him up. Porzinga is now trying to get positioned. Tatum again gets inside. The layup is good. Although Jova Zula said right before the all-stop break. There's 10 to 12 things. Why he picked 10 to 12 that we have to do much better. As Brown, nice turn around jump over there. Brown off to again. Another good first quarter start. There are quite little hesitation. Spins kicks it out. Brown back up top. Tatum off the fake. Extra pass. Good ball movement through holiday. He's shooting 63%. Brunson looks for an opening. On. Up and under. Where you talk about footwork from Tatum. Mixed shooting 8 of 11 from the field. Celtics right behind them. Seven of 12. There are quite steps. Knocks down the three. Makes one of the elite offensive rebounding teams in the lead. Alec Brooks fires away. And that's a three-pointer. They've already got five threes. That's part of what makes the Boston Celtics so good. In transition just so many shooters. That's his fourth game with the next. Richard gets inside. Take goes inside a horror horror. He lays it up and in. J.R. Point about Tatum. Great. There was no leak out. There was no transition. Drees. There was no cross matches. He kept it five on five. Take first. Mike. All right. Lisa Luke Karnat throws it up and in. You know, when Joe Mizzula was in a system coach when he started his coaching career. Doos McBride responds with a jumper and nicks back within four. Eight of double team gets away from that feed inside. Beautiful look. And Hawker lays it up and in. So Tatum. I got him it to its sixth to shoot. Lost the dribble. Good defense from Holliday. Pritchard picks it up. Pritchard slows down. Laugh is good. He's appreciating what we cannot do ourselves. Oh wow. Oh wow. Knocks down the three pointer. All right. Shot clock at eight. Holiday gets in the paint. Oh nice. Been moved from Holliday and gets the soft touch and bounce. Seven points for Drew Holliday. Brown chased by Deven Chinzo. He's back in the game. Top shot. Jail Brown knocks it down. Tatum out of the pack. Jail and Brown goes inside and the three points. Four points for Jail and Brown. As an NBA official, Jail and Brown, 16 points to lead all scores. Deven Chinzo connects out of three. Celtics right now. 14 point advantage in the paint. They're shooting a very high percentage. Oh McBride drives to the basket. Brown turned his head and McBride first passed him. I think Jail and Lisa learn what I needed to learn. Which is McBride. It's better than you think he is offensively. Absolutely. This year a big step. As white. As some room. And connects out of three. Seven foot three. You can give that cushion and still make a good challenge. Inside the lob, Porzinga's counter and a foul. The Celtics have the largest lead of the first half. Seeing different looks, different players going in. Brunsett of three points. It puts it in. 19 first half points for Jail and Brunsett. But we don't want to be caught in rotation. We don't want to give up wide open freeze. You might have to get 60 to beat us Jail and but it's going to be just individual one-on-one defense. Now count it and a foul. That won't go fight for the rebound. Another offensive board. This time from Hart. Hart drives inside. Laugh. Bangshot is good. And the foul. Brown wants to shoot this one. Drives inside. Swatted by a chua. Final seconds McBride to Hart. Hart drives inside. Laugh. He paints it in. Shot clock at three. Hart lines that one up. Connects on another three-pointer. How many fights over the screen? Draws a foul, Brunsett. And one. Those two bulldogs going at each other. This time Brunsett wins that match. Not one single defender and they're starting five. You think about this. We talk all the time about Derek White and Drew Holiday defensively point of attack. White hits another three. And shooting 27 foot jumpers. If that's not a unicorn, I don't know what it is. Tatum launches. That's a three. Now the Celtics three-point garage. Opening up here on the third. Time for the ball. Calls time out. Brunsett now with Porzinga. Got to step back. Gets the shot off. Cut it in one. Damon Brunsett. Josh Hart goes right at Porzinga. He's right at Porzinga's reverse layup. Banks at home. 12 points for Hart. But I don't care. I mean, he's just working so hard. And I love that he's in attack mode. Porzinga's no hesitation. Brown, look at a post up, Brunsett and Deven Chenzone looking to help. White off the bounce. Holiday White open corner three. They always seem to point for the corner. We're not fall. And Tatum, the rebound and traffic quick outlet to White. Orford running the floor trying to post up. Brown drives inside layup as good. And he's, him and Peyton, Richard Boat, have done a lot of improvement defensively so that they can stay on the floor for longer stretches. Porzinga's catches fires and hits again. Christophe Porzinga's now with 16 points. He's only taken nine shots. Ali Brooks on the drive. Elbow jumper. That won't go. He's going to be flying in. It just won't stop coming at you. Nice pass. To a true. Brunsett drives back up top. Heart. Fakes now goes up. Cornette drives. Bangshot is good. Josh Hart. Beautiful move to the bucket. He's got 16. And still able to finish. It's impressive. Orford looking to post up on Donovitch. Tough match up for a by Donovitch. And Orford immediately takes advantage. Brunsett looking. Orga, none of it fakes the pass. Drives. Now pulls up. Off the class is good as the shot clock expires. And the Dix cut it to nine. Ali thought he was foul. Pass deflected by Brown. Brunsett and the turnover Brown inside lays it up and in. A costly turnover there. And the Celtics back up by 13. No OG who's an excellent corner shooter. There's times where Josh Hart's having to do things out of character. Tatum drives. Tatum finishes. Now it perks just one of seven from three point range here tonight. Brown drives goes inside. Lost it. Orford gets it. Brunsett up and in. Five percentage of offensive rebound. I imagine that win on the road. At Minnesota felt like a huge, huge win. Hey, Wally. A three point of. You know, appropriate switching. Timely. And sometimes the late closeouts to challenge. Oh, white to Porzingus. Brunsett meanwhile continues his spectacular play. Flips out. One right hand. Another 34 points. Another eight assist for Brunsett. Tatum to Porzingus. This time puts it on the floor. They just knocking them down. 22 now for Porzingus. And then the next one. Celtics will go 4-0 against the next. And again, they'll play one more time as Deepen Chenzone knocks down that three point. 19 and nine on the road. And they coast here on the second half. Here at Madison Square Garden. And then the next one. And then the next one. And then the next one. And then the next one. And then the next one. And then the next one. And then the next one. And then the next one. And then the next one. And then the next one. And then the next one. And then the next one. And then the next one. And then the next one.
