 You ready? You game? I'm game. That's where he begins with the pelts, where everybody on their feet. Toron Lewis willing to live with that shot. You can tell, because Siubash didn't even rotate. Paul George, he's going up. Over C.J. He's got Highland in the corner space. He's going to take it himself. Blocked away. Z from behind. Flora's space now. Brandon trying to get to his spot. Fancy first block out of the game. There is a such thing as going too fast on the fast break. He waited. You're right. It'll be quite a letter. You want to stay away from that switch. Now you might want to take a look at Siubash right here on the box. Or C.J. wide open as well. He's having it. And it's a change in the way that you're playing in the back. You can come out and make some pay. Yeah. Good call. Now Siubash out the run. All the way to the hole. This is what I mean about the officials allowing a little bit more physicality. Yeah, playup games are traditionally a lot lower scoring. Where Koaliner's at is best. Box! And that's why. Because when he catches the ball and is blowing down and allowing the defense to kind of run by you. And then using that elasticity after real. Paul George. Remember the last game here? Bell's Paul George. He was watching the corner. Paul George all the way to the hole. Maybe he attached two to be eye. Switches it over. CJ on the reverse. Right, but this is my second key. Because he's got it. That tray picked it up. Train on the run out by Leonard. Catching shoot Jose. Yes. Leonard does anybody touch you? It's tough here. That's tough. So the bump BJ Tucker basically out of the bonk balls for this one. He has not played a lot at all. Brustradic. That's a Jew tray. Got it. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. It was nice to see trade knock down this first one. That second one. He didn't bring that ball down. Now Paul George trying to get it. And he will. So that's tomorrow night. Go to puttacons.com slash tickets. Puttacons.com slash tickets. We'll see you here mid range. George, it's too good to look. It's tough because they're in drop covers on Paul George. They're going to find the upper man potentially. Tyson taking himself. And he can't. And I like that because you're putting the owner so someone else to make plays. It's not accustomed to making plays. See on the trail. All the way to the hole. Jose has that. See you there. Jose has that. Jose has that. Come on Jose. He got it. Come on Jose. Jose on Paul George. He's going to take the long one and get it. Great looking inside inside of South of the play. And now the flipside, 11 of their own. It'll be man. It looks like he heard himself. That was by a couple. And this is really like a half-board playoff game. Isn't it? Good stand. He heard corner three. That's it. Who's that? I have to have them right here. Go fast. Find your space. Right. Right. Sometimes you got to throw the playoff the door to orchestrate the way you attack offensively. And read the most batch. Paul George sets it up. Highlands shares it after a misunicoppo. He got that one. Go out of the double. That means Z is available. And instead, CJ with a runner. You said that. You saw that. Now set it up. It'll be mid-range. Why? I'm ready. I'm out of mid-range back at him. See, after it. Took it away from Tucker. He wants to go back up. He will. That's strong. That's strong. You have to understand when PJ Tucker is down there. He's going to reach. First turn over in the second quarter of the play. That's a good turn. Yeah. Landage. Hold on. Maybe Paul George is fall away. That's good offensive. It's really solid defense. Now on the handoff. Brandon held up on the double. Good pass inside. And Z got home. That's a great double flash. Right? CJ gets in shoot. Zubat Zazid. But it's taken away by Ziah. Going back to the post. Z gets the finger off. Paul George with a great pass. And here fell. Zubat's got it. He could always challenge by Z. So it's back to three. After was up to eight. Z again into the post. And that's a thing. Everyone continued to put Zubat in that screen. Yeah. That's a good turn. We're going back to the back. I'm going back to the back. Z. That's a good turn. Paul George. Paul George with a great pass. And here fell. And here's the little one. And here's the little one. He's going to get the ball. You can continue to put Zubat in that screen. You see what Zubat did? Now he jumped on the high side. You have to still get there. Didn't matter. Now the run, her, with the euro. It's locked away by Zahid. And there's a good turn. The ability to block Zahid today. Go ahead and let her. On our series XM show. CJ on the run. The owner's answer it. And her captain alive. Gonna be picked up on Leonard. And now the floor is spaced for the clips. And Zubat. Yeah, bad Tucker. I thought for Z. And Z got what he wanted. So here's a three, a deep one. Brace. From. Go on Leonard. I'm gonna give you a straight. That day is five. Say you count that. It's a laser. It is. It's a laser that goes straight through. It's lands every time. CJ on the run. Sets it up. Herb on the fly by. And he's got a Larry from. I tell you, that's an excellent decision making by Herb Jones. When you get to the foul line. Clips now with 12 turnovers. That was just seven. CJ. Ooh. Nice move. And he finishes. It's interesting when they let certain things go at certain times. Leonard. And Norfolk. And David Bond again. Same result. And he did an excellent job of relocating. Was it wanted to go back to Z? Well, you got to flatten out. You got to flatten out. And get ready. Z got there. Got it. Do it. Just in mid-air. God. Just switching it. Paul George. Denied. Coffee. Challenge. Got it. Big shot. One-boy game. Our check back. It is all eaten. Yes. All eaten at 80. Z the distance. Got it away in time. That's 3.5 seconds, Joe. Did 3.5 seconds. Didn't take long. It's all going to blow down to. Can you get enough stops against this veteran squad? What a save with interesting stuff. Sue Mox is so far back. Right. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. Try on the lock. What now? Oh, oh, oh, oh, baby. That's a great pass by Najimarsu. They are coming out to help. Step back. Paul George, look good out of his hands. And Paul George. His second triple is up to 21. Jose. A three. Got it right back. That three-point line makes a difference, doesn't it, Joe? Yeah. Where were the desert last game? Paul George. Can't go under. You can't go under. Good defensively to be in drop coverage. Now Brandon held up by Docker. Followed away. Base line. I'll tell you. This is your stop making going over right now, Joe. I'm about to... Fifteen of the clock and Z's back on the floor and Zubok's going to his strong hand. It pays off. I'll tell you. He is going to. He is going to go into... Z shares it. Brandon, a triple. Got it. Seven-boy game inside a five to play. But it's going to be a five to play. Seven-boy game inside a five to play. Paul George. Finding space and finding the mid-range. So smooth. It's an honor ball back into the game. Train on the run-out. Going to the hole, sets it up. Her. He's got Larry. High percentage. He waited. I thought he was going to go. Now that ball's going to touch number two, Dan. They have two right now. Boy and Leonard floats it. Oh, my gosh. Old school. Five-point game. Hells of a chance is having to. Z's got to talk to him. And herb on the run. How about Larry again? Larry, grid in space. And the finish! Right. So now what happened is, hey, what's smooth? Or you don't want to give up a three here. That helps. Yeah, is it taken away? Herb to the ground. He's got it. That helps. So to the pound. Now you take a time. For a turn over. Take your time. Portland, tomorrow night. Listen to this. It's going to be a two-to-smooth kickstander right now. Z, lowers the dribble. That's a two-to-smooth kickstander right now. The balls needed it desperately. And they came through in a playoff type of situation. They went it by eight and beat the clips in the... ...and they were all in the same place. And they were all in the same place. And they were all in the same place. And they were all in the same place. And they were all in the same place. And they were all in the same place. And they were all in the same place. And they were all in the same place. And they were all in the same place. And they were all in the same place. And they were all in the same place. And they were all in the same place. And they were all in the same place. And they were all in the same place.
