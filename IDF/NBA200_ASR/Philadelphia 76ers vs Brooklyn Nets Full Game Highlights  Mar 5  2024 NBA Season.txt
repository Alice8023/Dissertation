 You ready? You game? I'm game. Here's Buddy Heal the choir just before the trade deadline. By Phil LDS, Bamba able to hook it in over Nick Claxton. As Nick Kners just likes the height of Bamba against most starting centers, Rich's pants the jumper, Reed and Nick was batumed as a small ball five. Let's play off the bench for Philly and Cameron came and on orthodox South Post Rope for him. That's really struggled on that. He fed some glass last night as Rich's not sent the three. Here is King, Claxton switch top, Heal the tap spouses. Lowry will fire and get in from the corner. Lowry started the last two games. That's one the last beat in between the scenes back in early February. Here's Lowry giving it up. Heal will let him fly. Johnson, Pitterpatter dribble. Nice touch on the bank. From King's Claxton able to secure the rebound after some help from Bridges. Dennis Smith Jr. Lobbett. Beautiful play back Brooklyn on the break. Dennis Smith Jr. Asking for the screen, then tricks Upray, plays it in, plus the foul. 50 fake from Dennis Smith Jr. Dennis Smith off the delivery hits the three. Beautiful pass from Dennis Smith Jr. Upray. Hey, Paul, try to throw it down. Whatford would have none of it. Upray the rebound. 26-23 field outfield leads it. Harris, connects on a three. Upray. Upray. Upray. Cups it up and in. By Upray. Five to shoot. Get lifted in. Wow, that's a nice one. There was five minutes of Lowry. Sometimes it makes it tough because there's Misha for long rebounds. The allowance of a team to get out and run because of the Misha puts stress on your position defense. He's so dangerous from B. And Brooklyn needs a timeout. He's had some big games against Philadelphia this season. Upray. An X. On another three. Shooter. It's a classic. It's time. It could be patients there from Shrewdys. With the first two Roe T1 bull. Flexed it could quite grab it. Lowry pops it ahead. Two on one. Buck rocks the ramp. Dennis bit junior after it and that's winning. That's half-numbers. Flexed it. Dips it side. And throws it down. Plus the foul. Real Abustile. Could be fun. Oh. Had to reverse to a layup. Still able to finish. Just Harris. Or this shit's Watford and that sticks the jumper. Harris. Poor hesitations and in the flip. 9.5 rebounds for Tobias Harris. That's 40.5%. And yet down to three. Stunning. And to Dennis. Explosion. Roe there. Rage is three. Stunning. Start here in the second half. Replacement of camp Johnson. He's a really effective in addition on the top left side. Blocker on cue. That's what the next thing. You go, I can feel you clapping your hands next to me. Listen to the PA. Telling me to do something. You are so childlike in the best way. You see only the 10. It's a foul trouble. Frutor. Oh, how about the touch. The high scoop. Most took as nose when you do. And on this end, can you try and target Lowry in Bamba both with four fouls? Fiddy, Spade. On a three. Time out. How about a drawout in Walsh? Uh, to tell him to make a triplet. They're going out of the half. But, technically, we saw him come out and he's got out of him. Oh, Schrooner explodes to the rim and finishes. But Harris has it. Well, don't you look at the push. Harris. Wieves. Dumps. Oh, what a rejection. For the walk around the floor right behind that was Dennis. It's a free lane and a free rim. Now, Sylvia's got to go. They only have three on the shot clock. Lowry, rings in a three. Lowry, new and lowry. Five to the next. And I could remember him going to one of the games, like walking off the bus, walking somewhere strange to go get it. Riches flushes it down. Close out, flips it up too strong. Rebound, re-down court feed, Ubrae to the rim. And Philadelphia jumps back. Next level here. Next level here. No problem, yes, brought back. Harris quotes it in. Harris. Double team. Off the pain. Pain of D3. He's good. No look, but two extra feed, Ubrae. No. Harris though there for the put back. That's R8 plus three on the glass tonight. Walker, Carves through the D and Blazini. 4-1. Five seconds left in the corner, Ubrae darts in. Good flushes, a throw it natively with two hands. That's still a time though. Two seconds left. Walker's three. Bang, hit it in. For the only walker to fourth. Using the window at the court. Give it go. Throw it around the finish. It's in the short. Got this man off in the air off that passenger who that was coming. Here's Hiel. We direct Ubrae catch fire at hit from three. It's an eight point Philadelphia lead. Then he's smitten the corner. He got it. One of three. Placston, great position for the flush in the foul. A chance for three is the net's are back in front. Truder now they do get back on defense. Hamed finds the cutter Ubrae who scoops it in. That ends the 11-0 run. Oh, he comes Dennis Smith Jr. It's just him and the rim of three sixty two in the row now. From Dennis Smith Jr. Dennis Smith Jr. Three sixty-dum. Here's Harris at an inefficient night. Smith all over of Harris. It's able to finish. Use the height. It's a small ball five. This is tire four. Harris massages his way inside and hits. Tobias Harris calling for a screen for bridges. It's the switch on Harris. Truder accelerates. That plays it all. Ubrae. The crossover. The cleaner. Trops off. Tipped from a two. Won't go. Truder chance here. Ubrae gets denied. Clacks it all over and then a submers on afterwards. Here comes bridges. The mismatch on Reed. Bridges to the corner. Finne Smith Jr. Dory and Finne Smith delivering winning plays down the stretch. Here's for two. Weaving. Ubrae getting into the paint. He's able to finish plus the foul. Five to shoot. Truder trying to work around Reed. His layup is good. Dennis Truder using all of the shot clock. And finishing. That is going to do it. Bridges in bounds. A much needed bounce back. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We. We.
