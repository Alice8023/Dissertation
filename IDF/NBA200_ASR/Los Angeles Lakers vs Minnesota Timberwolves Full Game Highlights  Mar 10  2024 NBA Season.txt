 You ready? You game? I'm game. My bad, I was a tie. Who ain't you know? It's so... Beeps. Averaging 18 points for Game and March. And he hits his first shot of the game. A steal by Edwards. And he stops and lays it in as game displays by Edwards. Well to the NBA and scoring at 26 points for Game. Nice pass by Anthony Davis and Hachimori. Drills at corner three. Dos Reed is really good from behind the art. Right on cue. Here's Davis. Fires to Russell. His first shot of the game is good. Hachimori got position deep and throws it down. Davis with a slam. It's Russell with the pass. That's five assists already. So all of the baskets for the Lakers have been assisted. Daniel's driving. That's a tough shot with a great shot blocker trying to swan it. Here's Russell three pointer. It's got a hand to the Russell picking. Not where he left off. On Friday night he's two for two. And one almost climbed over Anthony Davis. He missed a dunk but my goodness. On the way down he tried to throw it down. James gets his first point to the game. Edwards is really upset. Thought he was foul. Hachimori is seven shot attempt. He's taken half of the Lakers shots already. And the one that he made was huge because they were down six against Milwaukee as Reed answers with a three. James underneath the Davis. Davis up and in. I think it's a first doing the Sun one night and the father the next. This Davis slams it. So a D three for three from the floor. Edwards and gets the layup. Also Luke of Garza is out there and he drills a three. The poor for Minnesota. Timer at five. Prince. Feet Davis for the slam. They're shooting nearly 67%. What do you got to do particularly? Yeah, I think putting two on the ball, making them throw it around. And right now they're making shots. And the shot, Chris Vincis, won so many games. It's just three plus seasons. He's already number two all time in wins. Behind the great flip solvers is James banks it in. After an Oprah seven finishes, the first quarter hangs with the throw down off the ditch from Russell. And there are nine from the west. So they need to win these home games. McDaniel's banks at home. He's got eight. Here's Conley who's yet to score in this game. He'll try three and hit it. Lakers by one, three and a half gone by. McDaniel's on the attack. And the Lakers get the board and get it out quickly. Here's Christie. Reverse layup is good. James went the five. So good in transition. Russell downhill lays it in. With the Braun James back on the floor, he's not going to have the ball in his hands as much as he does when he's off the floor. But he can still maintain an aggressive mentality. Is Nasrid knocks down another three. And four five from three for Reed. He's with the slam. Lakers turn it over. But Edwards just four points two of six shooting. Reed goes for Alexander Walker. That's the eighth three for the Timberwolves. Now these wings for the midst of the Timberwolves have opportunities. But also means how the answer. That's a great first shot attempt since the first shot of the game. And Christie has a bad effect. And into the hands of Edwards. McDaniel's good defensive play. Edwards cans that long too. Reeves dribble that entire possession. And Barry's the brave against Reed. So Reeves starting to heat up. He's knocked down to an arrow. Edwards. Boy, how about putting on the brakes. And then barking at the Laker bench after he knocks down the shot. Hachimur. And another three in a row for the Lakers. From D. Reeves going behind the backs, spinning away from the Glockland. The crowd loves it. Reeves putting on a show with the fancy grip. Underneath Davis. Powers it in. And a foul on Reeves. A three point chance for Davis. If you had been the play and had tried to get to seven or eight, as Reeves cans another three is fifth of the first half. Alexander Walker fires to the cutter. It's McDaniel's for the flush. Here's Davis. Boy LeBron James. Only four shot attempts. A size it up here. And a three for LeBron. His best three point shooting percentage. In a decade. Down court. What a purchase pass from James. Hachimur is streaking down the floor. And a lay in. Reeves. Reverse lay up. Nas Reeves with 21 in the hand. Reeves with McLaughlin on his hip goes right at his chest. Back shot is good. James wide open. Pulls the trigger. And drills another three. He's two for two from D. They working around to James behind the back dribble. And the step through. LeBron with the strong move to the cup. Russell's only taken five shots. Tonight after a 44 point game. Edwards downhill for the slam. Got past Davis and flushed it. James wide open. He'll take it in slam. Thought about the three. But in two steps get right to the rim. Davis gets his third block. He also has five steals. James driving again. Hanging and scoring. Back to back. Buckets off penetration from James. Hachimura lost it in the lane. It somehow got to Russell. Hey, splash is home with three. Nine nothing run. Lakers. It's all happened in the last two minutes. Alexander Walker ends it though with a triple. He's just let the game come to him. He's done a great job of getting his guys involved. And now Alexander Walker knocks down another three. And think about the added pressure that that puts on a player like Anthony Edwards to create one on one. Not the three backing it in. Finishing group contact. Edwards looking to drive into the lane. What shot by Anthony Edwards over two lakers. Edwards in transition. Stop to the following. Pulls up hits. Ties the game at 84. Russell's step back three. Falling into the liquor bag. Hays with a put back slam. Three. Beautifully done by Nas Reed. And the West 25. Play multiple positions. They'll play in some of the three. Speaking of threes. Anthony Edwards drilling it. Prince. Nice move. Backing it home. Russell drives. Misses. Davis. Another offense at rebound. Goes up and scores in a foul. Brick point chance for A.D. Lakers by Warnigan. McLaughlin ahead to Garza with time. Garza. Get the basket. At the buzzer. Davis with rebound number 15. No towns, no go where to deal with him. Russell. 50 move inside. Get the blotter. Reaves picks it up. Reaves. Driving. Get to the left. Russell on the kitchen shoot. Davis. Another offensive rebound. And the step back. He's got seven offensive boards. Nas Reed corner three. No good. Rebound Davis quickly ahead to James. Now Prince up and under. Lays in. James drives. Lays in. A point laterally. Time out in the soda. Davis again blocked by Reed. Davis gets it back again. Reblocks it. Lakers keep it going. Prince with a great block. Unmagnuals. James finds Davis underneath. And Davis gets it the drive. Plus one. Conley. Able to get that one. Prince. For three in and out. There's Davis. Another offensive rebound. And then goal-tending. Here's James to the corner. Reaves on the spot up. Barry's a three. And Edwards gets going. 20 points of pull up. The three goes down. But Ryan gets a back down Alexander Walker. Spin baseline. Get to the rim. At 23 points for number 23. Edwards. Down the middle of the lane. And finishes with his back to the rim. Edwards trying to get around the screen to defend in shock clock at five. Now on the switch. Warren on James. James should go right in his chest. And finishes off blast with the left hand. Russell with the deflection. McLaughlin for three. It's good. Minnesota back within 11. We mentioned they got the clippers on the road. They played Phoenix twice. So, skills have been around for 50 years. Anthony Davis is the first player ever, ever. With 25 points, 25 rebounds, 5 assists, and 5 steals. Any heads? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
