Fixing inside. Gets his two steals. Five blocks. Hit five threes. But only did it all. Siacum works his way underneath. It's over. No collision. No whistle. No foul. Again, we've got to get off the creative with the big toe underneath. The saddle. Get corner of the green. So, man. I'm a shot. I'm a turnover. Here's McConnell. Well, this is very, very tricky. You've got to push it back here. Wrestly, it picks up the earned cash. The only area comes from supply. Oh, my goodness. Boy, he's got a steal there. And he's still a dupter right now. But he didn't realize that mountain still hanging out. Six for the visitors. Colle is looking for help. Gives it off to Blake. He's going to be in it. Yeah. Seven. Seven. What's the matter with him?

He's coming into quick decision. Now where there doesn't, With four rebounds in a block. A cow. He's going to fall. He's going to bend that by a random anzyc. Rebound off to the pace. Siacco, wanting it as he set up burly with Joe Zon in the way. Find it. That was a Siacco. Vintage Tories. Howdy boy. They won by 42 the first time. Kevin. Rock. Turner. McConnell. The Siacco. Starts to retreat and then. Gran. Look about it. The rest of the conch is nice. The first one to become more of a school to be inside the game. Inside. Halliburton, the second try. Get the bucket. As Halliburton coming in, averaging a career best 21 points per game. You're going to be so mad. Try to swing it back in. Finding college comes up with it. Couple around him. So mad finished it.

Halliburton pushed off against Jones. And the Jones picked off by Turner. And Halliburton. Victor pushed out a little bit by knee-smith. Looks to base one jumper down. Turner to Halliburton. G3. That guys me a little bit slowly coming. Yep. To start the second half. You got to maintain your focus. And finally, he is cornered underneath. Back out. Bacel. Well. Just in the midget top. Or give up Bacel credit there. That's right there. Webby. Back into the three underneath. Bacel. Where's it? Back. For the second half. Brandon and double figures now with 11. See, I got that.

Let's the crowd know you appreciate this. Devin regains it. And on the shot box, I have the victor. Stop the fires. Goodness for injuries. That's impressive. 46 injuries this season. We didn't have that jump and we got the lead. No way. So, Johnson. Kill another one of them. Final. Wesley. 303 to go in the third. West and five. Collins. Exactly with a style. Exactly. Great job. Keep it to deep. Devin, miss. Pull in the brakes and the turn around. It's important. The drop is dribble there. It's back to master. Master of the baseline. By Collins. The victor is probably there in the low block. They just stayed after it. Cattle pulls up over the lost one for two. Johnson. Turning the turn to drive back. Cattle. Use that good body.

Near the paint. So hand. Got it. Got it off the window. Two twenty to go. The cell. From the corner. No. So hand. Perfect timing. The tip of him.
