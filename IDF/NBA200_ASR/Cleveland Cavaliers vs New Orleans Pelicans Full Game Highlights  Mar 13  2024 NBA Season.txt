 You ready? You game? I'm game. Good as he? That's what I'm interested to see. He'll be controlled by Jared Allen. And our three officials and I debit got-braised. They call him the SUV. And I got you in the start, sir. I like this. Bring out that away. The person is aggressive. Or they weren't even as aggressive as playing through him. He's gonna say touches. It's nice to see him knock his shout down early. I love down to the mid-term. This is in his seventh year from... ...get it up early for Daria Scarlett. Down to the mid-term facts and facts. And I'll tell you the thing that you remember here, Joel, is we talked about it all the time. Guys, we're on that three-day road trip. It's you and I have gone by. Sometimes you'd like us to hear. Tells them their first leave of the game and Jared Allen for the extension. The three-day pass. The stretch of the contest has won for four. Take a road. Turn it all over. Down to the mid-term facts. Z, go to the rim. Follow your own. So to last year of his kind of crisis, there's always some expectation about him. Mid-range. Brandon got a call out of position. Dude. Jared Allen. Waiting for Mitchell. Good pass. And that's the thing that we started before has to be in there earlier. You have to point Brandon. Z, go to the distance. All the way to the corner of the five. And you know what you love when Brandon and we're dead? Three. On the break. Get it to the accord. Should he transition points? Right. He understands how to stay out of the way until it's time. Mid-range. Brandon and we're dead. He's got his going up. Marrow with Damien Jones. And. Transition bucket. One more. One more. Yeah. That was now one of five of the triples. What? Damien Jones and Jared's level 45 left in the corner. Yeah. Carlos got home anyway. You can get anywhere you want to get to. That's not right there for Movin. It's open quite often. Garland. Deep triple. He can't go to the screen. With his own. He's it for Larry. And. They're letting them go. They're on the defensive. They're not going to get it. Marrow with a wide open zone. It's up to an eight-point game. Run off the line. Man, take it away by the handle, Larry. He got down low. He's got Trey. And Trey with a great grab from behind. Good soft tag against George Neang. He's ready to get two fouls. Inside he goes. Doesn't get the roll. And gets it back in. He's playing through it all. That's all right. There's nothing there. Swing the ball around. And get the official shot that you want. Good rotation. High tray. But nothing you can do about it when a guy's left. And the floor is spaced and scattered. It's a low bird. He gives it off to the other three-point. Brett and Marrow gets it. Yeah, you're in scramble mode. CJ starts again. O for four and O for three on his triples. The Pellets hit their first three. They missed their last seven now. And you can't leave me out. But the thing is, that was the correct covers now. Shoot or shoot. Yeah, six for 37. Now Brandon. All the way to the hole. Goes to the line of the Bells. That's brilliant. This is what I'm making a recovery at the point of attack. Seven plus to play in the half. Good fouls. And Jonas on the finish. Brandon with a beautiful set up. Marrow. Man. Good nod that time. Wanted to go back inside. It's Mitchell instead. And then with their last five triples now. So is the ball movement, Joe. Yeah. Good pass. That's a great pass. The finish. Barely got there. Right into Brabskin. For shot that he's shooting right now. Looks online. Drain. Thirty-footer. Okay. Speaking of online. That was required. And he can dance. And he got there. And he taken away. He will. From at him. You got to go to finish. Yeah, the Brandon on the track. Nice. See, this is the difference. Right. This is the difference. Now the defense is fueling the offense. They have made as many as the Pellets of Attemptive. And then 10 makes. And there's a great look for Garland. And what? The screen. Yeah, but it's miscommunication. They did it away. They could have good defense of presence. On tray. And that's Karrie's record. See, he's going to get there. Yeah, when he brought. And he's got it. And now I just did a great job of taking away. See on the run. All the way to the hole. Right. It's the little thing, Joe. And in the boot. Gosh, I was a nice crossover. It brings up Garland for a three. And that's the issue though. That's the problem. Is you help? And once you help, they do a great job. And CJ had a great look. He's over six. Over four in his triples. So right now. There's another three. They're allowing this. You have to trust the guy defending the ball to guard his yard. Z. The runner. Got the roll. Try and get a switch. That's a thing. I said, Coral. She's going to get it. I'm going to get it. I'm going to get it. I'm going to get a ball. And that's the thing. I said Coral. So Herb gets it done at the free throw line. He's got four boards, three points. I can't get it. Yep. I can't. Especially Jared Allis. Really good going. What about the three point line? And you're OK. On the trail. Branded. Good pass, Rosie. And oh, that's a bad ball. Oh. I'm scared. Herb is out. Get it. Herb and herb and herb. Z. That's pretty. And now the defense. Again. The defense is. Lover. Steps out. Great. And an air ball. It's a great block by CJ. Got a piece of it. Now, Brad and on the run. Hold up. Got three on the way. Five point game. Believe it or not. And doing the little things well. Mitchell waiting. Gets the mid-range. Makes the most good. That's his first, inside the off. On the end off. CJ. Glowder. Got it. Nice little runner. Good play. That's parents lover for it. Looks like it was out. On the run. Jones. Jones has done a great job at just bringing energy. That's it. The honest on the down. Baxter pass. Trades. Gone to the hole. And gets the finish. Good job. Three Lover. I train. Can't buy it. Man. He's a good player. He's a good player. He's a good player. He's a good player. He's a good player. He's a good player. Lover on the run. And the finish. These are huge and they move it. They everything is what pays. Every cut. Every pass. Jones. That's Jones, is simply moving without the masquerade. You've got 12 points and I got that after the first. He's got 12 points and I got that after the four is spaced to getting in transition. Garland. Marrow for another. Yep. This is what they do. They're dominating now to close the third. and Garland. Garland is to be some easy river. They just keep you in a rotation. Here's Laverg brings it off. And he's one of the few that's down on his threes this year. Garland, you got the rhythm dribble. This is right. To find the three-point line of do that, Joe. Yeah. Z held up and he'll go to the line. The three-point line will do that. In decision, we'll cost you every time. You got it. You are 100% right. On the run out, Garland, on the layup. And that's how it works though. That is just how it works. Inside a nine left. He's off the foot. And that's because it's Laverg's presence. Merrill. Insole to injury. Yeah. Time out. Dye the Mitchell on the reverse block to way. And then close the game the right way. It's right. It's right. Here is the momentum. It's right. And Z on the finish tray on the draw. It's got a beautiful stroke. Good pace up game before the USC Trojan. CJ got there and gets the finish. Yes, he was. Really good grip. And a guy he's missed the last five of the right knee strick. First game, he's missed the entire year for that. It's Jared Allen. And Garland set it up for Donovan Mitchell. This is Garland's 24, Mitchell's 27th. And good catch by a Zile. He'll get another one. And then he's getting as if you look at these two. Derrick Garland has had hit the best games of this career without Donovan Mitchell. Donovan Mitchell has had the best games of this career without Derrick Garland. Garland, the corner three on the late close. He carries. That tells you. It also tells you he don't pass. Yeah, well, he's always been a shooter. That's what he did. He brought it 10,000 hours. It's not the black world. Outliers. JB's put in this time. Now it's paid off with Cavaliers. That's what he did. He's got a little bit of a goal. Yes, he has. And you look at somebody like Jamal Mosley. Submels will fall to 39 and 26. Step through for Modeling. Isaiah's out of the US. Because it began to mean so much. The bulls right now, the ninth spot in the Eastern Conference.
