 Well, get one more. You ready? Your game? I'm game. My bad, I wasn't. I'm a bad boy. I'm a bad boy. I'm a bad boy. Trying to get into the play-in tournament and they lost two consecutive games recently to the next. Now trying to be victorious tonight at the World's most famous arena. So, Pella, the fella with the rejection. As for Atlanta, they get to the basket easy layup this time. Big 28 point game on Sunday against the Caps. He played 39 minutes. Very good rebound to foreguard. I have just five pounds again. Johnson across the lane, head and shoulder faked and around J in the paint. Ispiel. Shake it and picking two consecutive hooks for Johnson. You know, I'm out with a four-neil lead. Mixed firing now. Johnson mid-range J in and out and back in. Eight-one at Atlanta. Very comfortable. Early lead for and this time, it's a two-up. Pressure's a two-up just elevating. Sadeek Bay, baseline, reverse layup. Got it. Yeah, they driving a truckly along the peace line. It should have been easy when you can't get it to fall. Bay there, contesting him. By Donovan's the kick. Three threes again among the leaders in NBA. Three threes made. And this time Murray answers. Which means that the next objective both the bone and the tissue around J. Lensney. For instance, considered day today. He's not on the bench tonight. No doubt though, we'll be working around the clock to get back. Harrison Matthews on the court now for Atlanta. Where's number 25? Murray straight away J. Rebound that inside to Dek Bay, reverse layup, counted on the five. Ride the long kick, Devin Chinzo. Continues to misfire, Gets his own rebound up and pop off the glass. Got it. The big raggo. In and out. Long rebound, Devin Chinzo. Somehow keeps it alive, gets to the hole, hands it off in the corner, make rise. Got it. Nick started. Oh for seven from the field. Since then, there's six of their last 15. Oh wow. Big time, Jim Bruto Fernando. Terrific. Founding in a sound in that time. Got 11 points on five of seven shooting. Nick's trying to answer in the corner by Donavitch. Contestant and. It's the next gig in a style. In a turnover, he gives an easy opportunity. 16 footer straight away. 100. He's smoking off the pints. And here come the Hawks in transition. Faris. Nice look to Jalen Johnson, lays it in easily. Yeah. Opportunity to show what he can do. Hunter. Deep jumper. Got it. The Andre Hunter off the bench inside Fernando. And he has a stripped heart with a good slide of hand. The numbers, the kick in the corner by Donavitch. Pure. That's what they need. Claim. All seemingly gravitating back to the Hawks. How Murray. The John Day Murray. Splashes one down. Hawks have been working hard on the defense. Attesting. A Chua. Big hop. Hitting shots. Yep. Right. There it is. Time out in Atlanta. A little more mention now previously. Devo Re3 ball. McBride deep. Now the Johnson's starting to fall. Even Jinsa trying to create. They swing it by Donavitch wide open. Drives blocked by Coppela. Make that by Sadiq Bay. Johnson. Rats it around deep in the corner. And that's the John Day Murray with a long rage ball. Brunswood out random. Without Robinson. But still got an uphill climb here to come away victorious. Even Jinsa just sliding to the basket off the throttle. McBride. Seven to Chua. A Chua. Quick turn to the basket. Force it out. Bang out at the fall. Pracious. A Chua. For the next for this one, however, with no J-Lim Brunsson, no Julius Randall. Oji Annamovi. Meanwhile, by Donavitch off the back rim, Coppela with the offensive rebound, and the tipping. They went on a scoring ramp. The three balls started falling. Nice look. Even Shin's going to Harton Stein. Old display in the game. Skip pass, Jalen Johnson. Ross Corne. Hey, deep. Got him. I like the boys in composure. From the three-point line. McBride. And he'll knock one down. Inside Marie Jumple. Oh! Hart. Face line. Here's Diven Chinzo. Got him. 38 percent. 24-63. This is the top Johnson. He has been on fire. He's leading all scores with 22 points for only food. Now with the New York Nicaragua. Hart. And J-Charles. 75-66. Oh, juice. Clyde, should give you 49. Yes, sir. Inside by Donavitch and he scores. Here comes Josh Hart. Racing Euro left the guy. Ryan Hart. Trent Forrest. Forrest Traveller. Deflected. Big Duff. Johnson. Quick turn and bucket. Trent Forrest. Spitting. Pumping. Got Donavitch. The Andre Hunter with it right now, along with Bygonovitch. And Hunter. He shot off the mark. Fernando taps it back out to Johnson. Lobb of the baseline and a two-hand flush. That's for Hunter. That's winning basketball. He rebounds the averages as well. So he's really distinguished himself tonight. The lead back up to eight. Now Brooks. Striving. Takes above. And makes it in. The New Shot Clot. Cross-court. Baseline. Brooks again. Reloads. And sends a zanvan a two-hand jab. Murray. Hawks would not really cross the lead. And Patelio. What, Jalen? He's got Bygonovitch on his right side. Here's a cutting, even chinzo. Back to Hart for three. Josh Hart. Still has seven rebounds. Six assists. The usual versatility from him. So Linda Deepens as well. Murray. And over here to shot over. The outstretched arm of Dante. Not pay deep in chinzo just for all of the shooting. Not five of twenty-one. McBride down the lane. McSteal have a chance. Hart. Not until 1973. He just started keeping the steel. Murray. And it'll splash one down. Pujante Murray so calm and relaxed. The World's Human Box like the championship. Now by Donovan. Got it. You mentioned the four as a component of this kind of ball. McBride poking away at the basketball. Five to shoot. Murray. Just throw it at the rim. Airball rebound. That has stuck back in by Coppel. Trying to figure out this Atlanta team. On a night in which the mix have not shot the ball well. Or defended well. And that is a perfect example as Doreandre Hunter gets to the basket again and lays it up. Six of a line out of here. Now Murray. And Hillhand. Murray down the stretch without let his team lose. Next couldn't buy one down the stretch folks. The Maginzo gets that one before. 137 to go in and the next off. Johnson the lob. Baseline 2 and Jam by Coppel. The next is a team. 16 of 52 from the three point line. 30 percent. 38 percent from the field. 38 of 9. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent. 28 percent.
