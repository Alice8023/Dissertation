 You ready? You game? I'm game. Richards will jump against Collins. And we're underway in Salt Lake City. 13 and 41. They won three in a row that jazzed drops or straight competitive along the way in the first bucket by Brandon Miller. And see if they don't try and get it yet right there on a backdoor cut. Throw it out the column section. Mark himself in the corner, back over the top, up the wing three and back. Mark it and it did work. Mark it in. Nice job. Shot clock. One's dry. Turn over. Mark it in one's and four. And it was showtime. Cody Martin, backstaff, Taylor Hendrix, rides his belt buckle. Good defense by the rookie baseline drive. And that's a nice move, Mike. Cody Martin down the baseline, reverses it up and in. Out to Charlotte. This passes seven minute mark. They'll step back triple up and in. That looked pretty good from Trayman. Trayman had four threes. They beat him up by 0-23. And the thing they've been doing, they've been really inserting the effort defensively. That shot. That's what Chris Don will give you. Bridges passes back out front. The lead. The close critical was talking about we traded for Grand Williams. He said, he said his physicality allows us to place. Williams just missed that three. Will Hardy said the same thing. The play for me, he got to play D and that's one of the focus points. As the season continues on, market and world won in. It's an on the shot clock 17 left in the quarter. He said in traffic backs it back out. Deep straight away, three down the barrel. 37%. Done. Little push it up and in. Chris Don. So the pain is how much I've enjoyed my year here. How much I learned from guys like Green and Green, Dale Griffith or me. I mean, it was a ton of betters when I came here. I see a young group that's learning how to win. That is hungry to win. They're very well coached. Will Hardy, well, best young coaches we have in this lead. We'll be right there in the other three. You can tell both teams have a good locker room. They like playing with each other. They passed the ball well just like that on the one. That looks like my home, Kelsey. How about that? I got a little track to be going here. Both teams jury athletic both fast. Off the glass, cup of rim and in. They marks him with a couple of glasses. Those are the Dallas and O.K.C. They think that PJ going to Dallas and Gordon Gordon Hayward is off-priced, frozen in the middle of the three. I think those two guys are missing pieces against Chicago in his day. And it tied a rookie record. I know you're speaking with three balls. That's what he does. They see this as the three straight away from court pieces. Based by Kion say once through that string. Here's Williams, another three. Back to back. The jazz two point shots. Our fantastic well over 50%. You know, Parks and just 51% from two. Yeah. And you know, the three ball has been kind of an human seal for him, of course. And the first half. Collins, one bounce inside. Drives, hangs and hits. He's been terrific at the rim. Yeah, they got the nice seats today. It's up in the balcony. Out front, the wiggle, the drive, Miller. Stop some pops good. That is probably the greatest innovation in the NBA game. Is the slow motion two-step layoff. Through traffic that Miller just did. Two blocks, nine rebounds. Mark and pushed off behind the three point line to put a body up on him. Euro step. There you go. And finger rolls off the two. Charlotte definitive really well. Fall knocked out of the hands. Hendrix. Got it away. Kion say. Under pressure. Maybe I don't know what it portends, but it's probably a good sign on a drive inside the hands. Up the mouse goes down. Hendrix. Steers down. Grant and Miller. Collins. Hands it off. Sepson rolls inside. Step back, Jay. Up and out. Put it back up in any young man. Nice bucket. Taylor Hendrix. This is the layup. This could be fun. This guy gets up. Ooh. Hendrix. Disrupted the shot. Put the bucket. And the smallest man on the four draps are rebound. Sexton to Kionte. The trailer. Straight away. Three. Five. It can't get a better shot. It's a roll right 27. Something to know. He's on a roll. He's headed for Hornisex. Oh boy. That is a flush with an attitude. They're going to go. Three point game. Jazz with the ball. Seventy-six. He's on it. Here's George. On a runner. Walker. Collins done. Taylor Hendrix and others. It's a nice roll. Up and in on a power. He hit a home runs on Jason Tative and Jalen Brent. And you can also say more in his smart. Well, he may head on this kid. They sure did. You know, he started the last few games, but Hendrix gets the call the night. This isn't coming up on Walker. The fight is not only his offensive game. He's a big advantage. It's guys you can give you 20 on a given night. Jazz bounce back. Over the top. Taylor Hendrix. Three. Rainbows at home. What a big third. Now nine boards in 26 minutes. Thompson. Pulled mine. He turned the clock back a year or two. Oh, you're a top 10 pick. Number nine. Potato Hendrix. And it was a day you're supposed to be instantly ready for the NBA. How about that pass? Wow. Oh, what a fucking JC. It's tried to do too much. In other words, dribbling make a move. That's just turned, jump hook over a smaller defender. Well, turn over for the jazz. I give a three point shot. Back to back, tripled by Williams. Now you got to kick it. Sense of all. Wide open. Got it. And the buzzer. That's a big shot for him. He's a big hit up. Bullly. Dumbled and triple team. Sense of all star selection. Last year. Walker. Up and under. Nice move. baseline drive. He rotated out front for a three ball at the hand of Miller. The little end hit shoots. One man to beat. It's done. It comes with Walker. Walker. Listen. Oh, it's not a big hit. What was the big hit? He's a big hit. Hey, Murray fills the paint for two. That he was fouled, and Walker's got to go top of there. But he probably was fouled from the corner. What hit? It's a five point turn to the back. Right here. Oh, Walker. Richard got the position in front of Kessler. Move these new hornets are, what the jazz youngsters are made of. where the jazz on the third quarter of the fourth quarter has belonged his Charlotte until that bucket. Because they just left a really good shooter with a wide open look. Besides, it gets it back out of free, straight away. And Grant Williams is the 20 point guard. Isn't it amazing how you could change personnel? And Charlotte believes. That's a big group. Coach coaches the Wimby players are playing their guts out to work. Beautiful pass, though. A little Richard, John Collins, at the backboard. They pass it out. Here's Williams. 11 on the shot clock. Tiantay, George drives it inside the dish. And the bucket. Oh, my. That thing, that ball was out and dropped back in for John Collins. You got to release. So take away the triple. That would have tied. Or faded to two point. Now you get the swing back. You missed it three. Stay up. He's a shooter. Rich's backs out and now drives. Gives an elbow to marketing. And the bucket is good. Rich's got to get a stop here. Right to left. Left to right. He'll take the shot. Tiantay, clutch. And that seals the door down on Utah. The jazz, 9 of 39 from three. There's a moment with Clifford and Will Hardy. And the jazz will try to recruit.
