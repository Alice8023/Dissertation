 You ready? You game? I'm game. 28 points 10 boards. Seven assists of ammo. This first quarter brought you by First Tech Fence. Dot-com slash Blazers to learn more. Up top Simon's, lines up a triple. Got it. Can't keep a good man down. Man, pretty after the tough shoot tonight. Ain't no he's a better shooter than that. No better way than getting to rock early. Okay. J.D. joined in a party too. 12 games as he's average 19 points or those games compared to the first 27. He's up fire. Yeah. With the rebound as well. I'm going to be 11 again over that span. Trying to get Rozier obviously integrated into the Miami system. He's ready for the spring. Here's a high bounce on the run. Bummer makes a beautiful bounce pass off. Any good shot Blocker does for you to commit to the shot first before fully committed to the jump. It ain't knocking his down on the sand. We will see it more and more over time. It is a different level. The way he's able to move his feet. And he Chris Murray active as well. And he gets away. They get the more alert. Chris Murray saw that cut. He wasn't guarding the cutter but he had help position. Slid in there. Help his teammates out. Yeah, can't see. Yeah, he did. Last defense a possession for Miami. They were in zone. But since they didn't score, they don't go back and set up in his zone. Typically, teams. Seven attempts per ball game. He's been doing it for a while now to 60 or so. This guy, Simon's a deep three. Man, he was way out there. Yes. Against the Hornets. And I know we mentioned that game a few times. Yeah, because it was that bad. It's so bad. They didn't even watch football in afterwards. And I felt like that was the right. Because the bar he stood in a position that take a charge. Martin Saw and then it changes approach to the basket. Butler. Jump pass inside the love. Snare just the scores. That's a good pass. He's in the two leading scores for Miami. But he was getting put into the lane now. Keep things up. It's love for free. The love. Rules look free. That big message. And here is a well executed. All that's successes. Here is Jeremy Granford, a two hand hammer. Once again, the blazer. He's just trying to chisel out a window. And this would be the first in the month of February for a man. Over here, Matisse Thibon, a triple up an anion. And he has really been struggling with the three slowdown, Jimmy Balloon. So the Lano can load up the tie. That's a nice pin. That's a nice pin, Jimmy. This pin's in it. Yes. Martin had a tremendous series last year in the finals. As did Butler. Butler Knife said drop step spin. School score. So Jimmy Balloon goes into scoring mode. Shooting percentage in the next game is a collective 54% from downtown. 54% from three is out of reach. All of them here in the area. He's very effective, playing off the two feet. He did to the paint in the takin'est time. As Anthony's effective, playing off the two from the three point line. Is double team or hard hatched? Two players, all of them from time to time, and he used that against them. How about that, Louisville? Hard dribble. And it's an eight point, please. You're just a lead here. Devison from IELI. I don't want to be like outside of C'mon right now. So money rises. Drain the shot. Laura sitting on that left hand of Butler forging the break to help. And then finds a band out of bios. And he seemed to affect it and handling it. Murray Short arms one there. He picks it up. Flicks it outside the C'mon. Fakes drive. Side steps out of bio and leading it in. It's off here to add a bio. Spin's into a jump pass. Get it into low. Drop high by Rosir for three. No. And high to the Huckes. Terry Rosir out a little bit. Founcing to add a bio. Eighth doesn't quite on the multiple pump makes. That's both. And a bio with the leader. Scott into the final since. And two nothing lead on the Milwaukee bus. Butler into the lane. Founcing over the high step. He's in and scores. He went. He's going to dribble up out of back court. Again Charlotte the other night. Go to the hole. Following from Grandwon Go. Rebound Rosir up the floor into the lane. Hippening up to the glass to lay it in. The acrobatics. Only because of the way they've operated in the past where they just kind of awaken. They're extremely well-coated in T.D. Making a strong move like that. They've had 30 different starting lines this year. So, Sphol is still taking her outside. C'mon. That's good. Raises for three in Doxah Downies. Looking better and better. With Rosir alongside. The Lv. will come over to brush straight. Robinson turns. Fires the three. High hands from Clara. But Duncan Robinson drills the three. To Walker Kessler right after saving Sharp Got him. You'll see that kind of bounce on that kind of screen roll lax. Jimmy Butler with a steal and the drive and the lane after Duncan Robinson three. And I went to the middleman Jewish community center as a kid. The Blazers practice there. Group and B. I wasn't going to root for the Lagos. Absolutely not. I started wasn't going to root for the ball. So, had to be the Blazers. From people here in the road, see me March 23rd. I'm going to be at Revolution Hall recording my very first stand-up comedy special. Ticket still available. Two money Camaro's coming after the game that night. Off the murk. They're rookie for mile. The drive in. Jump stops ripped away by Jimmy Butler. Sides settled. Gribble into front court. Insighting spots out of bio on the post up for the hook. Power is through the contact of Siamonds. And lays it in. Twelve games in a row now where he's made at least one to be points out. And he's the longest streak of his career. So, for some reason, he's feeling good. He's feeling extra frisky from the pre-port line this season as Anthony Siamonds is back to doing. He gets rid of a Jerome's ear. Cosh, court, Robinson drives into the lane. Jump pass over to Yovic. Or three. So, the thing is, to money and to worry, it's not like they did a bad job. Grant handling. At a bio attending to him. Grant. Little shithee. Into a bank of an end. He's got space. He will make the right calculation on that ball. Walker gets one off from the key. Now it's Murray's time in the torture chamber without a bio inside. And they swing it to the opposite side. Robinson gallops in. Lies of the hole, lays it home. So, then to Mark gets his anthem in. And it is Yovic's. Yeah. Get it around, when anthem in. After it may pluck you. Because of a missed communication. Miami looking for their first lead of the night inside. In transition out of bio. Shubbles to the cutter. Rosier scores. And Miami is in the driver's seat. The 405 left here with the. Behind the defense on that weak side. This ain't put in the painted areas. They're inviting him to go in and throw their pass out there. And then they'll recover and it's led by his. Grant by Hagen's cross court. The tease with the lemon is shoot. Out on top, Camara. Between the wickets. Into his spin. And the hesitate. And the lead. Up and in. Overhawk test. Hagen's playing in the seventh game as a blazer. Two way contra. Grant leads back. That's a heist one out. Reeth is after it. And always at the rim. Hagen's up to happen. Tied at 80. Love. Reeth's defenders with a pop fake. Over to Martin. Riggles into the lead to the glass to lay it in. But the heat might have opportunities to do that throughout the remainder of the game. Off to go on the right. Look at the edge. Five of a fronting clumber working. And we tore the ball. They swing to the top. And there's Kevin Love. Oh, the pendulum. I can climb in the lead to three. Double team Simon's hook pass after Hagen's. Five of a pop fake drive. Into a beautiful delicate runner on the line. Close to go over there and help with all start break stuff. Now that he did some flippings there and interviewed her and stuff. So very nice. Yes. Yes. How about that? Look at that move from Simon's. No class no run. Here's Simon's over to five of a line to the lead. Drives it kick. It's Hagen's with it. Backing down. Spin Hagen. What a play by Hagen. Yeah. Pull it up a little bit. Look at that. Some battle download. Well, the sock for deep. Lunging Ford Hagen's drawing. I guess off his balance. He swings it. Two rosier. Pull up stick. Got a beautiful move from rosier. He's got 17. That's a good pass. Give that ball a walk around back to Avery. Who is knocked down several threes in this game. Gonna get that to go. There goes the look. More or less carried up in so many areas. 28-10 and seven assists on the road against Sacramento last last night. Blazers, boys and gentlemen. Simon's into the lead to the glass. And the flush. Whoo. It was already off. Long gone to hit. Not impact. This up. Mark. You had a sprained right hand. You could not play in the second half ever getting a double double in the first half. That'll do it. Thank you. Thank you.
