 Yes, Dennis. Here's Thompson. He goes in and scores while he and his brother both making waves in the NBA. But Rui, a monster going to the hole with a nice spin. That's a good dish for Dernfield. But by Davis, A.D. was right there last line. The spin of the score that time by Jalen Dernfield. Devo from the corner. Yeah, knocks it down. The Angelo Russell. It could be an easier pass to, I think the Bronzo, A.D. going on the lane. Try to hit it through his lane. Five is where Rui, two hand dunk. And Hippity hop into the fuckboard. Great pass to the Bronnie scores. That was an excellent backdoor pass. Here's his in the corner on its way. Thompson. Thompson's got a couple of double doubles. Is run by the way. Four reads. Rui, Genji's been really shooting the three better of the last two three games. Absolutely. Behind the backdoor. Oh, BG. How about that? LeBron reads, he returns the favor. We've got under five minutes to play. A little push off. Oh, run in the floor in the trailer. Throw it down big guy. Mr. Troy team's been in L.A. for quite some time. LeBron, down in the lead goes. And he spins it up. Backhand layup is good. Pick it now. He'll twist it. And get some easy buckets into defense. Outstanding. As A.D. works in, the little jump hook is good. Nice. I saw right there taking advantage of his size. Good pass by Spencer. And he gets the assist. Finish by one timeout. Evan fornier missing. And he gets it right back. And he turns it to his right at the foot of the line. Go to get the shooters touch. Evan fornier. And I want rattles in by fornier again. So he's hit a couple of the road. That one from downtown. Yellow Prince. Spot up three. Got it. Good to see Prince knocking down in three. I believe a former piston. Detroit's not going to go away. Nice shot from the corner. That's Troy Brown Jr. 100% and that one is thrown down. Once again by James Weissman. Lakers trying to move it around the perimeter. D.Lo on it. Twin. Donne goes. Yes sir, DiAngelo. Tap once. Twice. Underneath. Weissman again. Got a fifth footer. Yeah. And writing it up at end is DiAngelo again. Knocked away by Pritz. Saved by Hayes. What a play. Now to the Bronx three on two. LeBron. Poor Ann. Score it. Poor Ann. Rolling Weissman. Another dunk for James Weissman. And weissman. Played play by Hayes. Up ahead for D.Lo all the way to score. Defense offense. I just tell you Hayes is just an amazing to take that lob away. Comes Ivy. All the way to the rimmy goes with a little roundhouse. Yeah. You got to get back on defense better than that. Donne. He's spending his scoring. Oh my Jesus. Happy birthday Ivy. 22 is a great eighth brother. The boy Ye from deep knot down. Another rebound to Anthony Davis. The broad lead to that. Rod and outlet. A.D. LeBron. They don't pick up Reaves. Davis aren't able to tap it and results in a three point play. As he got his own rebound in score. Look at this. The hikers wowing the crowd a bit. Davis. Boy he has been. And he enjoys himself coming down to the other end. Rod, free trade. Nobody picks him up the trade down the track. As you said, just go who's gonna stop him? Reaves. They don't pick him up. He's open for free. Fresh. Snow for Austin. They can six to 10 from behind the arc. Little post-moop. Speaking of that is a gallon dirt as two for Detroit. It's a strong body. Nobody can say anything. Cutting him, nobody picks him up. And he throws it down. Little confusion there. The Lofa. He's gone. He's gone. DeLog. Down it goes. Yes, the Angelo timeout. Long shot, long rebound. Funtakio. DeTachamore to the rim. Coming up on the final minute. Spin A.D. Loft-hand. Loft-hand for two. Real quick. What do you think about the half the play of that certain amount of games? As DeLog scores to be eligible for all the awards. It was just that far thing game when they were out in A.D. As you see Detroit scores. Gibson comes out. As a strong rebound. Oh, A.D. Get it out of here. We're going to restart it with Rui. But they've only got three to shoot. Rui pulls up for 14. Now how about this? Three on one against A.D. Three on one against A.D. Come on. It's not going to work. Wide open. DeLog. Got it. Well, we're seeing a team that had several different lineups. Nice dunk by Thompson. Thompson's underneath. He's away from the defense. And the two hands. You know, you think, oh, no. We haven't ended the All-Star game. I mean, we're in the final third. And that is a jumper by A.D. K. Bounce. Bontecchio. Oh, he sees A.D. No, he's going to win the ring. He's going to win the ring. Now, but this is a good drive by Thompson. Played pretty well. Rui's down to the ring. Goals. He's going to win the ring. He's going to win the ring. He's going to win the ring. He's going to win the ring. He's going to win the ring. Pretty well. Rui's down to the ring. Goals. Rui first layup, but he can't score. Now it's cutting him a nice bounce. What a nice bounce. And a quick run on the left wing side. And Thompson throws it down. Detroit led a couple of times, really, by one. Cutting him into that little short jump shot. Well, you know, during their 28 game losing streak, that you know when you talk to everybody from Detroit, they just, they stuck together on really down the lane. The linkers get a lot of that inside. A bucket here, and it's going to get a lot more interesting. And they do hit a three. The blind steps out for a three. Got it. I think, Bucket. They can afford to treat buckets. A lot of time left. It's coming out hitting it. You let your guard down, don't you? It's just natural. It's a good rebound, Rui. Left hand slam. Don't. See if we can get Spencer on the board right here. Yes. Good one. Welcome to Los Angeles. James Weissman making a both out of here in a minute. Yeah. Pounding the glass. That's a pretty blank right there. Yeah. Shot is up and in by Milko. Extra effort against three extra rebounds there. Oh, D-Lo mid range. She's made awful. We're going to think about how well those three have done to. Yeah. Spencer, ring it up. Down it goes. Jake Milton down the middle of the go. Kicks it away. Take him away. Dan Witty. Here's a two on one, Lakers. Two big steps by Christian Wood. I like Christian Wood's footwork. On a night, Troy Brown Jr. And there's Weissman again. Got a box out early. I know it's an old trade as Prince shoots from the corner and knocks it down, Bill. More yay. He's known for his three point shooting and shows it right there. The Angel in the attacking 47. Surveys the floor. Fines LeBron. It's up. It's down. LeBron James. LeBron's got another one. Oh, he's got to call up those logos. Here is Jake Milton. Not a great pass. It still finds Weissman for about his 50th dunk tonight. Underneath. Put up in and by Thompson. I don't like it. You know, it sets the floor of the game. LeBron schools. I can see, you know, on the last couple of minutes of the game. So, Mike Jackson. Jackson Hill. He's getting out tonight. Underneath. Throw him down by Weissman. There's a lob underneath that a good land. Now here is Atomora. Couple of big steps again. And it goes for Chris and we're coming out. By the way, Thompson throws it down. We saw the big smile of Gabe Vincent. And you talk about Christy was playing very well. Yes. You know, all were playing well. Vanderbilt, it's been Peter, our defense. Reddish. So, just the thought of having everybody back. Healthy. A lot of big time challenge. Big time. Health. Big time bench. Good, Desch. Oh, the trafino. And nearly came out. But he'll score the bucket. Throw him around. The tacos are still alive, by the way. But we just want to get two more. You know, I've seen everybody's face. When they see their statue, it's just a little damper. We'll say that there could be was there. But Vanessa did a great job of coordinating this and her speech. I feel Jackson speech was amazing. Allie Clifton tomorrow night. That'll be fun. Allie. Very much looking forward to that. And it should be a lot of fun. By the way, this game is not official. You know, it's just a little bit of a big deal. But it's just a little bit of a big deal. It's just a little bit of a big deal. It's just a little bit of a big deal. It's just a little bit of a big deal. It's just a little bit of a big deal. It's just a little bit of a big deal. It's just a little bit of a big deal. It's just a little bit of a big deal. It's just a little bit of a big deal. It's just a little bit of a big deal. It's just a little bit of a big deal. It's just a little bit of a big deal. It's just a little bit of a big deal. It's just a little bit of a big deal. It's just a little bit of a big deal. It's just a little bit of a big deal. It's just a little bit of a big deal. It's just a little bit of a big deal.
