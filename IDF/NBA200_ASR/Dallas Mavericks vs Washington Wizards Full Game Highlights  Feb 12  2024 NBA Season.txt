 The least amounted to 18 points within these last four. Skin pointed out the deep end of rating and the points allowed an average of one oh seven in the last four and in this NBA. Daniel Gapert has a defensive rebound against the team he played with for almost three years and who traded into Domles last week. Gapert paint catch hook shot Roseanne. Kind of maneuvered and a nice little reverse inside with the soft finish. Giant killer Roseanne for Tias Jones. It doesn't all have to be. There's a lot of reasons to have new energy with the Mavericks right now and it's happened. The energy was off the charts on Saturday. Kuzma offensive rebound situation leads to a three pointer. Gapert is controlling before. Here in the opening minutes of the game he already has a half dozen. And he even hit by Luca Dunchich, the Western conference player of the week. Now she has to play Kyrie. Lakelock situation. He drives through the defense. Oh and Kyrie with that little extra bit of levitation. Before it comes down he puts the shot up at score. He's a uniquely talented offensive weapon. Got a little basket for him so far. Three ball on the money. Kyrie Irving. Along with a first round pick to the Mavericks acquired from the Thunder and then rounded to the Wizard. Tias Jones to pass and here's Homescoring in the face. Domles controlled it because of the one by Kyrie in the paint. Luca follows in his own miss. He's getting it stance. Derek Jones grabs a rebound. Jones had eight points against the Thunder. And he's seen last week against New York. Oh there's a Kyrie Irving special. I'm the misses both. About 75% on Fritos this year coming off a 21 point game on Saturday afternoon but a doughnut on the Fritos line and a catch and a finish. Last minute and a half of the first quarter post-house. Any idea foul. And that will count. We got a Mike in the headset for him down to the bench. That's how he's going to celebrate his first day. Yeah. His 20th birthday today. Elbow J short for Ardaway. And his goals for Gabri is right back in the game and for once justly. Kyrie holds and patiently waits before attacking. And he attacks it side and he got him. Pull up three to beat the buzzer. No good for George Paul. You know where people. But we're off. We've got to show them every day and make sure we play a basketball team with that's of our ability. As you speak on that Derek the travel aspect in the pro aspect you come from a program that was obviously a great program in college. We have a lot of great pieces. We have scores. We have stoppers. We have people. We have shooters. We have people who just anchor everything down. Honestly feel like we the dark horse that no one wants to talk about. You had a great working year in one of the honors of that. And then the first time he was getting shows to be part of the rising stars challenge. Oh wait here. Something good to get out of here. There we go. There we go. Now a chance for it. I want to give him all the credit for that. He deserves it. By all its green goes up strong. And got knocked down hard too. And we'll head to the free throw line. What a finish. Long rebound. Green. Makes a leap for it. And then Tyus Jones in transition. Tyus Jones running with him. And a score for Guzma which puts the wizards in front and an opportunity to extend that lead by a point with Guzma on the free throw line. Burving leech Dallas with 13. Luca has 10. Part of a way looking for another basket. Gafford with an offensive rebound. Bites a cutting. Oh, he's playing with a macro. Bad. Brad Davis didn't take bad shots. Sorry. Sorry. He knew where shots were coming from too. That's bad. That's bad. He's got to be in the pass and homes the finish. Perfect addition. Maybe another block. Oh, I think he got a fingertip on that. He may have helped that ball to go in. I don't think we'll see too many of those. He always should transpire this. I will concur with you. Obvious. Look one. Rift from outside. The arc. 14 rebounds for Gafford. Inside position. Catch and finish. PJ Washington. In that case. He's my corner three. That's good with point nine. The Wizards are going to take a seven point lead into the locker room. The Mavsaw. An 11-2 run occur by the Wizards to end the first half. They're up by seven. They're up by ten. Jordan Holt for three. Oh, boy. That's his first bucket. That was a pretty good helping recover there by PJ Washington. And here's a pass off the handle Gafford. But Green reacts quickly to it. Oh, and Green. Nice finish. He's been rewarded. It's out on the floor. The stock is still afforded. Now here's a drive across the paint PJ Washington. Ducks it off. The reverse jam. Right over the court. Stop, Dr. Brad. You know, I had lots of good comfort there. That's exactly what he said. He says, I'll get you trained right away, hard. You ever did ready? I would be. Come on, man. Bagley just had three offensive rebounds in that sequence. Tyree, you're a stepping and finishing. Pula Bolly hopes Jones and the double team of Pyrepe. Right back. To cutting Green for the flush. A misogist missed. He's over six. By the way, Pula Bolly off the bench for Washington is over seven. Has Luke a phase and scores. And Dallas creeps back. Tyree out of the open court. Going in Pula Bolly. Another Tyree special. Can't wait. Nadia floats it all the way over to Pula Bolly and he hits. That's his first basket tonight. Pula Bolly hit. Jordan Pula on the move. Pula, good deepest by Tyree. Rashont Holmes in a loose ball. He throws it out to Nadia. Shot-faked drive. Leigh for Kisperch. He's going to lose it on the way up. Still champs it in. Obvious. Looking for Bagley inside. Tipped away. Dallas in a ill-peak court. They need some best break points. Oh, Pula Bolly. Wow. And Jordan Pula tracks it down to the corner. A quick three and a miss three. That's Pula Bolly. Wow. And Jordan Pula tracks it down to the corner. A quick three and a miss three. That's Pula Bolly. Wow, man. He's in their fight for everything. That's perfect. And that's what Washington wants to do. Jordan Pula. No, but Bagley there for the rebound and put back. And you can chip away with two for the eight minute flip. That was a stop. And that is a good thing. Party for three. A rare one made tonight. And it is an important drop buster for the Mavericks. Looking back in at that dead ball for the coach's challenger moment ago. Look at inside working against Pula Bolly. Pretty good defense with some better offense. Great offense by Luke the state patient. Pula Bolly tries to knock away inside a swing pass. Washington. Party party party is on. One point game. Look at has a triple double this rebound number 10 to go with 12 dimes. And 19 points. Double on Luca. Clean up for three. Come on. Just playing the ball. Play the week again. First points tonight for Maxi Clema. And the first Dallas lead since the game was 49. 47. Really aggressive defense right now. Oh, Kuzma. Now Pula Bolly's up on Luca. Luca on the drive. Gonna shoot a little penalty. It's on the money. Revenge Luca. He's just so comfortable. Well, the game has had a weird beat. And the game is going to be a little bit more aggressive. But it's not going to be a little bit more aggressive. You're so comfortable. Well, the game has had a weird feel at times tonight. But he's knocking right now. Remember some time ago for a stop. And that's why it's knocking. Good defense by Luca. Second go by Othie Estil. Three. Oh man, it was a lot of contact inside. He is still down. And it's 5-0-4. Clema! Who is now a Mexican cleaner? Who is now a Mexican cleaner? Othie, a underneath. And scored. He's crafty. Well, these making shots, not making shots. Clients, Jones, so good. Good pass. Hey, Pary, out of hand and raise your hand. Turn out. Whatever the case might be. Play 48 minutes. Yeah. The game's not over because you've had a bad 36 minutes. Right. Play 48. About 25 seconds of plot time. Now Kuzma. Against Maxi Cleba. Good defense and an offensive shot. Oh, that's a shot. Use that on final, I think. Ladies and gentlemen. And this is it. Thank you.
