 Well, get one more. You ready? You game? I'm game. But add in a cantama, such a keeping score. Pat Flair, with a ball fake there. Yeah, that's a rarity. In recent weeks, Nick Richards has been letting every single jump ball. And that's one here in this building, early in the season. The Hornets won in the next building in the second game. Rookie, truly good neck, threatening roll. Cantama's good golly. What's he gonna do? Shoot it. That guy's incredible. I love watching him play. He's the inclastic guy. There's a lot of rim action. You find your rhythm quickly. We had an honest debate early in the season. I thought he was gonna support 25 points tonight. And he helped me not to do that, but he said good news. He said replay it. I've had one or two of that. I think he shouted it out. Yeah, a lot of it. He missed into the game. Rookly players wanted to challenge that. Where did it go? Maybe they showed. Second field goal, Brandon Miller's Thomas in the corner. Kyle Bridges with the rebound. I got the pass, Brandon. Now I got a win for the battle. Shoot it and give it to him. He said I want to do something. Shooter knows the plays over. This possesses over if he gives it to Thomas. That area in the clock. And Flagstan won on one with Richardson front of him. There we go. Oh my goodness. He is six over seven. Take seven shots to six minutes. Oh, thank you. And then by Richard and then Paul. Nick is gonna work hard. You get off this is production after the ball. It's the rim by teammate. Shooter. And the shooter is everything is Germany one of the whole ball of the way. Dominated that entire tournament. It's 31 to give the short game to them. Miles behind the back. Get two out of the blue. Oh, hey, body control. Yeah, both teams shoot the good ball from two and three. Pretty cleanly played game so far. Bill is going to continue to work. Brandon Miller is third field goal. Well played all 12 minutes of the first corner. First time turns the corner. Waldoff, five six mid-Juneer. I'm gonna end first field goal. I'm gonna end the good job. You've got an arm in Gillian right now. And the Smith-Juneer. Blackston. Big Richard is gonna battle each other. The offensive class all night. They're super aggressive. Nick Richards. How do we bolt in? Blackston, a good way to get the tune in Nick Richards. Blackston. Great play, great time. Dory is pretty smitten. Tough spot right there for Davi. Williams bounce pass time. Richard is like a runaway train. American court player right now. The fourth guy with the ball, Miles Bridges. First time sector pass, Regent. Yeah! Give me a sense to bird time. I'm gonna get one. Finish Smith. Balls. I'm gonna end the good game. I'm gonna end the good game. Finish Smith. Ball attacks the Blackston. Maxing in a ride as quick as they come. He-Gitch as the full attention in the next right now. Richards rolls to the cup body's blind. And an in one opportunity for Nick Richards. The one with that is you. He-Gitch takes it right to Sharpless. Play it on the shoe and score. Then say you take advantage. Miles Bridges that the love to. And put it alive. So long to Bridges, mortedly by four. Shooter. He-Gitch plays her. All that's been. Go go. Offensive rebound Wilson. Max the way in by Travis. And the. Miller. Ball fans to the floor. You bet. Our bridges with 15 air bridges with seven. Just say it. Brad William. Score the goal. That life ball gets hot. Get rid of it. Oh. That's. That's. He made the playoffs. Each of the last five years. But they're in the cup body right now. Bam. Thomas. And a foul. Chance for a four point play. So it is a four point possession. But that could have been seven. Talk about a way to lose a levy point lead in a hurry. Throw it at the heart. His kid is nails. 23 points for Cam Thomas. And only 15 minutes of court time. Miles Bridges with the right hand. We're going to give an assist. See Bridges gets the goal. 26 points. One assist for Thomas. Me, Gitch puts a double team. What the hell? Because it's always a pass blow. Thomas high three. Run down in the corner by Trader. Bridges. Second three pointer of the game. Perfect call. Bridges. Two mix. Going out of here. Yeah. There's Brandon along the baseline. You called it down. What a big kiss. What a hesitation. Just like some of the agitation of change of speed. And it's a chance for a three point play. Hornets catch up break. That would have given Brooklyn the lead. Brandon Miller. They run sharp. Second effort is true. And he quarked. Sharp. And he quarked. Sharp. And he quarked. Sharp. And he quarked. Sharp. And he quarked. Brandon Miller. Another jump from Brandon. That was Brooklyn. Yeah, it was only there when he earned an end. It made 62 straight. JT ball. Oh, that was a combo. And it's coming in from the goal. Trader. Black stand. Black stand. Black stand. Good to meet you. Great Williams. Cross an opening. Get the whole town roll. Next miss. He could shoot it. That ball over time gets hit. Bridges. As Bridges in front of him. Rolls it over the front of the iron. Three, you fall over the top. Break goes behind the back. Nope. In which you had at least three jumps. Lock her down. Get the three point at the ball. And she's out. Miles Chitnon 19.83 bounce. Meijich. Got his own miss. Back to the ball. The two. Both year pro just coming over. Welcome to city after the Thunder Wave. Seven fun. And to be full. And a foul. And to the ball. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. One. Two. One. One. One. One. One. One. The Calvins has never got there. Good defense played by Trent Williams. I bought an exclamation point. That was my practice in the end. You will have to break the scare. Come back home. One of the few home games you have. You know it's big game. You go back all the road for two more. You go back home. You go back home. You go back home. You go back home. You go back home. You go back home. You go back home. You go back home.
