 You ready? You game? I'm game. Bunker or the Ram? Get any kind of rest, one of those guys have to do with Jordy and handling the basketball. Something new. It's late in their career. We're starting with the basketball. We're in there all white. Remember they were in Boston yesterday. But they get the first basket of the game. It's Bradley Peel. Back course got three fouls already, earlys. Better and Peel and Sclob don't think it bands with that. With the right hand, mild bridges breaks the seal. Peel. Finds Alana. He leads the NBA in three point shooting and that was a wide open. The other side is ready for the fall. Beach itch, extra pass into the corner. Man. Pointed first three pointer. I like that. He was for the booker. Five and half minutes into our game. Rich Williams picked up a low pass and rings the barrel. Absolutely. One of two humans in the building tonight. And it had a six minute a year of war trophy in their mag game. Look at me, chitchat of the window and the men. They bring a Dobby's burtime. Merkis didn't look to the basket until he knew that he was open. And the little half hook goes up and in. Alana. Oh my goodness. Ring in the barrel with a lot of time. 12thunk of the year for Grace and Morgan. Much like Grace and Alana. Good shoot up for Greba. He's strong up to put his head down. Offensive rebound, mild bridges. Spitting on time with Grace and Neal. So with Kevin Durant out of the game, he's going to go the attack first quarter, not a field goal. One is going to spend Paul Kuchit all the time. Paul Kuchit is trying to loosen up his knee on him right now. Has a patient pass the bill? Hey, burtime, spine. Paul Kuchit. Starting a new thing, hesitation pass. Air Gordon. Too open. It's got to get a stroke. He's been doing it for 16 years. Yeah, early in the year. Paul Kuchit. Will you put the pin down? Did pin. You knew that time to get it up. Sons with nine. Assistant, they're going to make a shot. Burntime. Oh, look at this. Let's bring it free with the finger roll. First dunk of the night, Frinnick Richards. He's now dunked in 26th straight. Bradley Beale quickly the other way. Richards in a sight. Shock locked out of three. What are you going to do? Oh, put it in his eye. Bradley Beale put it in his eye. I mean, he was tight. Miller. Rick Seale. He had been pulled for two and six minutes of portage. He just knows the lane. That runner's like the layup for him right now. Durant by you, guys. You've been dunk number 50. Durant. First field goal of the game. For Kevin Durant. Nothing you should play in. Two three minutes, Stint, so you can pick up that third. Three play by two. He and mine made up new exec. It's going to do the minute he got it. All fake. That did work. No, let's have the field. Start the goal. Make it. Deflicted by Burntime. They're not going to get continuations. All they are. Crazy thing. Swing it up there for three. He did. That's the first. Bucket for Devon Booker. Had been over even. Mejich. Another layup. He's going to get it. Right now. Have four guys. Durant with only six. Durant with only six. Great. The show. Yeah. Hornets down. Nice. Mejich. Hold the pole. Fulton Charlotte. Lee. Allen. Lost it for a moment. Fies. Gordon. Aaron Gordon with some foul money. Regis leaves it for Brandon. Relocates. Press. Re-pointer. He is real savvy. Realizing at least one three pointer made for Brandon. NBA rookie records 33. Nurgish. His throws away in a vendor and gets that. She got the handle for Richards. Durant. Durant. He got six and eleven. He's super smooth and the clock is at seven. Kevin Durant. That's the first three point of it in a pretty durant. Yeah. Sun's a jelly. He's a jelly. Regis swoops in with his opposite hand and scores. Booker. Score the goal and a foul. Kevin. Booker. Kevin Booker. What? Jack Locks down to four. Man. I'll run around the verse. That's the point. We'll confirm Boston, Portland. Eric Gordon. Born three pointer of the night for the Hobbit. That's you thinking of. I like that. Here's Meets you. Turn the free trail line. Easy. Something you can get set out of. I don't think you can just hold it up. Up and straight up straight now. Got more than a third of the horn. Point. Gordon finds Allen. Three said the Allen. Well. Extra pass Williams. Squirrels at Crown. Green Williams. The triple. That was 16 points. Third quarter has been his best scoring quarter. You back to turn around. Take the D.H.O. Good to be your spot. Booker draws a crowd. O'Neill. Roy Stone-Neill. Booker to bail. He's got some, they got some upside as a team. Trayman. Just beat the middle. We need to run that quarter. The screen was set high enough. Not sharp. Man. The win. The win. Where the fuck? He's got a ball. He's got a ball. He's got a ball. He's got a ball. He's got a ball. He's got a ball. He's got a ball. He's got a ball. He's got a ball. He's got a ball. Oh my goodness. The hit button to make Richards. And Mick is called for the final. He's now 3% for the line. That's how Brandon Miller uses the window. Yeah. He's just five. He's been working with the size advantage all night long. Born at stout 13, 7 minutes to play. Well, I was printing with a man of mine. I heard her. Per time switches out on his nerf gauge. Beal. Shot clocked out of three. Allen. There's a reason why he's got the highest 3.3. Cally. That's like Dennis Rodman. Oh, get in there. That's what I'm talking about. A staggering retreat. Five-twenty remaining. Beal. Paying to his left. Still hitting. Everything changes when you marry into the Curry family. Two percentage goes way up. Kevin Durant doing Kevin Durant. All the buffs did hand the last night. Still no Juel and B. No. Another offensive rebound for the boss, Ian Bear. And he gets himself a dunker. Stand time and score. Grant Williams. Re-pointer for Grant's. His third of the night, he's going to have a 20-point game. He came in second in the shop put. Still work to be done there. Nick Smith. All right, maybe something built on for him. Okay, Juel and B. Nick Smith Jr. They're better at having a little bounce. So the Phoenix Suns are going to win the season series from your hornets. Two games to nothing. It's an 11-point final score. Thank you.
