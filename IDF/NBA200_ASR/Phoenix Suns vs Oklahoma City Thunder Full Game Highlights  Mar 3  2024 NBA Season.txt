 it. Нคร Trace, we came back again. Early after this one got Ben B for the sons. O'Neill with the strip. KD on the fly. Got it in one. Doris, he might be the guy that teams constantly but their weakest defender on. No question about it. I mean, a nice backdoor comment. It's something he's seen from Nurgut. Quite a bit. He's... Drops it off for Peel on the fly. Got it. He might have something in his contract here. Of course. He thinks there's a bonus. Peel sprays it out one more. Great ball move in Andrew. With the cash out. What? Chris movement right there. No, this Alex Hander. Snatches it back. Works on Peel. foul. And one. SGA with the three point play coming up. And you know, give it up some inches as you see. Check it or work. Whoa. Big time move and finish. By check home grip. Peel raise him right now. It's yokic's is to lose. But he's got to be right there. It has to be when you look at the fact that he is the leading score. One of the leading scores in the NBA as Gordon fires away from the Rayman. Knops at home. Saving the league. Roaming the point right now for the sons. In the back court with Gordon. The lob you backs with a nice catch and go. Look at how small they are. The zone defense wrinkle is something rather new. Frank Vogel tells us. Gildes out center. Gobs with a rim on the zone. Pies four players like pilons. Thorce you don't see somebody penetrate a zone like that. Oh come on. I mean the handle the ability to get into the middle. You're backs inside. He's done four goals. And more miscommunication by the sons. Williams and one. It does it feels like they play beyond their chronological age for sure. Frank basketball IQ Josh Gideon with the lane his first field goal of the ballgame. Doris they're shredding that sun zone. Inside ball ball up high and lays them home. Here's Wallace on the fly raises up. And home win with a cleaner. This team will get out and run opportunistically. Their first in the league and points off turnovers. But miss shots. Yes. Get them out. Heal from the. O'Neill inside. Gordon didn't even land with it. And he missed it. That's a chip you got to make. If they're going to double him that aggressively. He'll just Alexander put it on a plighter and lead it in. Loot door not get away. And a little room service coming up at the other end. Loot door is in KG space like acne right now. He'll just Alexander double team. Beel and Durant all over him. Loot door for three. Bottom. Well Sky what an improvement. He is the master of controlling possessions and making good decisions. Run a little stack pick and roll. Heal just Alexander lost it. It came back to him and he laid it home. Talked about Durant's prospects of all NBA defense. All defense this year he said. If he was guarding the media. Keep the first team all defense. The old steps through out to Gordon one more to Alan. He's going to be a big win and picks him out. Here's Beel for three. Beel out to O'Neal. Three on the clock got to get busy. The three on the way. Cut it. Let's go to George Sedano. George. He's got 17 points and 16 minutes in the first tab. So I followed up on said minute restriction and I was told that it's a range as opposed to a hard number. And that the current pace is on. Okay see under. Another turnover and a two on one as a result. Billions with the easy. Again we keep saying despite their youth this is what I mean about them playing beyond their years. Beel in the mid range not to hold. The on ball on the delay. Gidey he's made three three pointers tonight. That being his third. Nine for 19 from the field O'Neal for three. Nurgut's battling got the offense and put back the ball. The on the with the ball screen. Gildges Alexander with skills to pay a lot of bills. 24 making a look. No you're right. It looks easy. It looks easy. Great screen by Nurgut. Durant from deep got it. These two teams feels totally different to me. On opposite ends of the spectrum. Right what is it that the young people say like the vibes are a half-year-old? That's a much right now. Okay see they are. Durant on the cross over. Not Durant by Eul. Wonderful deep catch by Brace and Eulant. Durant cross court. Good more. Gordon cash. Good screen by U-Base. And Durant doesn't need much room. We've seen them over and over doors. And out to Steven Lee. Durant on the move. Alan catch and shoot. Got it. And it's a three-point game. Lee inside. Oh you missed the lap. You got to find the bucket here. It's been a bit first of all homophobic. Is it Luke Dork? Yes it is. Wow. As well as gets ready to check in for O.K.C. And immediate double team on the catch on K.D. Alan on the drive. Brace probe. And finish. He's on a bit of a minute restriction. What should we expect as far as minutes in the fourth quarter? Yeah he's going to carry the load in this fourth quarter here. And we got to get him out. Get him back in for cross time. Oh what a move by Biel. Steps through. Into the corner O'Neal with a great fake on Williams. And another three. The belt is just game. We had a successful challenge out of the break. Jim has got gunpelt. Dremon greens 26. Chuck locked down to five. Saving Lee on the baseline. Nowhere to go. It got the lap. Wow. O'Neal and cross board. One more into the corner. It's up three. And the bucket good by Wallace. Oh my goodness. He'll just out. Alexander. We've been through rush hour traffic and cash is out. Oh that hung in the air forever and Wiggins with room service at the other end. Three. Phoenix has given them an additional 10 tonight. Nice backdoor cut. He'll just out. Alexander. Oh it's some mid air fireworks. Wonderful conversion. The possibility of a final hit is to go home. And the last hit of the game is at the top of the top. And the last hit is at the top of the top. Ladies up to eight now. And this is starting to resemble the previous meeting between these two teams. Beel, slick witty at the rim. There's an a theme of theirs. From the fourth quarter, Mark. They have struggled all year there. You'll just out. Alexander talks in at the office. He's decided it's time to go home. I think. fires, contact and that's going to be an offensive bow as Grayson Allen took a shot to the face on the spin move. On review, the call stands as an offensive bow. That's it, so no hostile act. That's, that was it. OKC is now challenging to play. On review, the challenge is successful. It's been overturned to a no call as the offensive player was in his normal shooting motion. At the time of the whistle, he was in his upward motion, the basket scored. Phoenix will resume with possession on the base on it. J.D. J.Screen and roll goes dween, spins, fires, contact. This is why, I mean, they've got big time guys at the top of their roster. He'll burrowing his weight of the bucket and Nurgut's chips it in with another rebound and remained in first place. Did you hear me? First place in the Western Conference, the youngest team in the NBA.
