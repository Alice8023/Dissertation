 You ready? You game? I'm game. My bad was the time. Who ain't you know it so? The name to the 51 year old Oli as he had a run ahead coach as the tip of one by the Cavaliers and we are underway. John Michael Braddority and Serena Winters. Thanks so much for spending some of your Sunday night with us. Here's Darius Garon, he's checked by Finney Smith. This pass is picked off by Thomas. Thomas is at the big game against the Cavaliers and his young career. And Fridge is blind, rise over jumper to open the scoring. Yeah, it's going to be. Just to be aware to recover to that basketball to stop it, he comes up a lot of the steps. Harris-Levert, Roars down the lane and Thunder's at home as Levert gets the Cavaliers on the board, takes the handoff to Schroeder, Blackson. One time was Jared Allen's other study in Brooklyn. That's the time he goes to the hole, takes the Finney Smith feed and then that's heaven early. Yeah, Jared got rolled up, rolled up a little high, tried to help. Got a little bit out of position and then created up through the bet zone. Garlin waltz is right around Schroeder to the ring. Amazingly, he didn't miss a game in college either. But Villanova, Garlin fire. Hey, Vaxit down, Darius Garlin from the... Vaxit has the partner, he is given way to D-Ron. Sharpe is a big blind jumper. Garlin finds the trailer. Yeah, hey, knocks it down. Oh, we went on that big run. That's... George likes to be that trailer. He does. He does. He does. Drive on the seat and hit that shower in momentum going forward. Yeah, he did a shooter accident. He's rebounded by D-Ron. Sharpe will find Lonnie Walker on the run. Walker, another form of Leaker, versus way down the lane, puts it up and puts it in. Cut shot by Walker. I don't know how he made that shot shot. We're almost got it back. Shooter. So let's settle this thing down. Bridges is up. He's going to fire him. Bridges has a two-mine, nine points. LeBurt, turn to the corner. Look for Allen. That time, Jared Allen makes no mistake. Turn on the floor of the cat. He's down to close out this first corner, corner. He's an Allen street. He uses the window and knocks out as well. But Mark Brandt, Mary, everybody, Winston Bennett, maybe feel comfortable man. And I didn't feel like an outsider. And that was what was cool. You can see you with those NASCAR books. And I don't think about them as a figure my favorite is Warner. That may kill it. I don't think it's going to play on the other side. I'm going to go for him. For Horta just, if he's a to-let him once in a while without him. Bridges, Ola goes to Clarkson right through his hands and the Nanzah was Smith. He turns to Clarkson and Clark to Dougson. Meanwhile, here's Jerry as Garland. He'll find Harris, LeBurt. LeBurt lost the ball. Smith behind his back, find Schruer, back it goes towards Smith. He puts it up and in. What a wonderful error. DeAng spins into the pain around 50-spin. He puts it up and in. What a wonderful error. That was fast. Oh, this is great. You got to read it, can you? 96. Okay, 90-24. 90-24, 90-24. Thank you. And he opened his playup place up. I'm going to rip you off. Right. Here are the broadcasts to Amor's Gavaleer's drill. 48-41. Under four to go, here in a half, his faction with the basket he dunks backs in. As it does in four years to go along with five rebats. You got to go. You're just joining us. Sorry, Brad. But your first handful of the cows are in foul trouble as Neang for three. He's got it. Your DeAng's been bigger this first half. He has 11 points. He's the high man for the cattle. And I think they're getting there, but they're going to have some pieces of work to add. You have a good plan after half time. Quarter. You're going to work on clacks and face away. Yeah. Oh, my. Nice job. I can't fall. I'm going to rip you off. I'm going to rip you off. I'm going to rip you off. I'm going to rip you off. I'm going to rip you off. I'm going to rip you off. Nice job. I can't fall. Shooter, Robin goes to Bridges. Bridges to the foul. I'm back to Shooter. Shooter. A tear drop. He's got it. The nice play by Shooter is he walked around Allen and floated over Neang. Except the roles that you normally don't make. I have to accept. But it's all those little things. But that's just showed you the value of team play. You move three starters that you beat the best seed. So you can maintain kind of nudity and guys know they're going to get the minutes. So those are the two things I consider but also help. You have to be healthy going in the playoff. There's a lot of interchains. I agree with you. We could be a nightmare for so no question. I don't see the reason why we can't take the e. I agree. By the way, they played without their three starters. Yeah. He gets those other three guys that come in and play with a little more similar type of attitude. I don't see why not. Did you see that? Yeah. I don't see that. I don't see that. I don't see that. I don't see that. I don't see that. I don't see that. I don't see that. I don't see that. Yeah. A loose ball is bad at the shooter and the next three seven or the first 14 win. Girl, nearly picked that off plainly. Thomas however hits a three. He gets fouled. Yeah. On deepness and office. I mean, I said it early. I think here at Alan's defense center, I'll pull things to the floor in the NBA. No question about it. No one is against it. No. Karris knew he was there. It's almost like how is most. You can feel that guy being there. You know, Karris is going to put himself in position to get the rebound or get the pass. That's why you know he's there. Well, Burton of the basket. Well, shooter is on his side. We play on. He's in his mix. Oh, no. Then that's with back to back dribbles that were he established the six point lead. Kevin Durant. Wow. And Nick Clack, this is two seasons. This is five or ten years ago. And Garland fires a nail as a three. That's incredible. True, it uses the Clack in screen twice. Now goes the Clack. Man, that's a play that is at a lot of success here at the Seabed. Big Port. Shark. Over the top. Bridges doesn't need much room. Doesn't need much arc either. And Bridges is now five for six from behind the line. Playoff runs. The champion with the warrior is is that Florida misses everything that comes right to finish. Yeah. Shooter's got a hurry. He beats the shot block. Oh, boy. Jones shuffled with Coro. Coro swings one back up top at Starless. Garland off the border. He's open. He fires. He can have. Oh, I want to know how to shot my crick once again. That patient's a print border. Shooter. All the balance. He's lost by the working border. Shot block is down to two. The shooter off-balance. It doesn't matter. The shooter's fine. Third quarter continues. Team has dished out 27 big assists on 32 field goals tonight. That's a lot. Good. Good. He's getting in the third quarter. Not good. Thomas to the basket. He goes high off the window. In a big fashion. It's a team fight. Just like that. Good shot block. Coro with the block. Up ahead it goes the border. Border into our shooter. Hooks it up. That's the shot. The basket might get it back. For the casualty. Look for that juice for Adam. It's critical. But you don't want to go just nowhere. Being patient. Cam Thomas. I'm going to large majority of the season. With the Cleveland chart, the Cavaliers NBA G League affiliate. Put up some big numbers there as it's Cam Thomas. Once again. It's just now feeds Gielin Wilson. Moldly closes out on him. Sharp now in the pose. Shot block's all the way down to two. Oh brother. Thomas got fouled. Thomas gets the role. And Thomas has a chance with the four point play. Well, shut one back to Finney Smith. Now shooter again. Like the shot clock. You'll fire and score. And the shooter now is a Chris 7 for 10. Well, shut one back to Finney Smith. Now shooter again. Like the shot clock. You'll fire and score. And the shooter now is a Chris 7 for 10. And dotted with star bread. Already. So potential net line up with poker. It's phenomenal offensively. This is the matter if they can share the basket. It's a great door in West with the Blazers as the corner steps back and connects. This is a veteran and air Jordan coming off the bench. Bridges for three. Joe's rebound. All these fast finds that they are moldy. Moldly does. He's dead. Yeah, he's the third right. He's dead. That was an attendance at our wall of honor ceremony earlier today. And paint wheels to the basket and figure rolls it all. 116-101 is the Brooklyn League. Here goes Wilson to the basket. He'll float and score. You're mentoring him in what area? That will do it. Your final score. That's 120 cows. 101 Brad quickly uses cows.
