 You ready? You game? I'm game. And the third of four meetings this year between the Thunder and the Mavericks is underway. You might have heard Ernie reference a big showdown game. I don't see how the Mavericks go without Luke Adonchitz tonight. They have not run a road game without Adonchitz this year. Josh Giddy stole finish and finally the scoring gets going here with Giddy's tough layup. Mavericks with 38 and 28. They jumped into that seven spot with the sun's loss in Boston tonight. And now a half game behind Sacramento. They've got a favorable schedule, although they do have a West Coast trip coming. Thunder got to go quick. Down to four, Australia. Across to get rid of Jones. Get into the flotter. It's good and they come up with points out of that possession. Gap from back in the paint. No one guarding Josh Giddy. Kyrie Irving. Barry's a three. There's a win against the Golden State Warriors. Bouchard just heard him a fourth quarter of that game. Count that basket by Lou Dorn and a foul. Found it, but Giddy Nico Harrison and Michael Finley, a lot of credit. They're still going at it. And remember, they had Christophe's poor Zingas and they were sure he was there. They're so good. There's Chet Holgren with the rebound. And Williams pushing it here. Jay Dump back in the starting line of Danny Mist Tuesday's game with the right ankle injury. Rarely see it in the NBA. Here's Williams again. And Taylor Williams. He's got a lamp now at three pointer. Making an impact quickly here on this first quarter. Underly to by three. Irving, step swung it. Oh! Gaffer. Habers went down with Chet Holgren on his back. Keep it in real. Stance spitting over here once again. Go to Salahchandar. Look, step back on Washington. He's right with him. And Shay Gilges, Alexander, rings one in. That was good defense nearby. And when she has a report, we will pass that along two years. He's tough to him to return. And this is going to be a big carry. Irving somehow hangs and scores takes contact on the head, especially crunch time and end in the end of the playoffs. As they had jone, let's jone, fly by and jose. It's a three. And out of my case in Wallace, an excellent defender. Ex-em lost the handle. Couldn't finish it. And now here comes the thunder. Wallace, shift key. The cutter. Joe. Got it. And a physical therapist. And you mentioned the health of the Oklahoma City Thunder. She deserves a lot of credit. Is Gafford. Habers won down on the lob coming out of that quarter break. He was a three away from breaking the consecutive field goal attempt to make record. And with the ball losing, it ends up in a hands a hard way. And he reigns in a three pointer. At one point game now. Ex-em, doing some playmaking here. As Washington misses a three, Gafford's got the board. And Gafford goes strong. And a primal yell. And one. Daniel Gafford. Chance in a three point play. Those are the three without three game losing streaks this year. It's been steady for this team. Jim Hardaway hits a three pointer. Kyrie Irving back on the floor. Ex-em will go to the bench now. Look at the toss down. Here's Wallace. Oklahoma City's scrambling here. But they get a man wide open. Kyrie Irving drives. Got Gideon. And Washington missed it. Kyrie Irving all picks a rebound and quickly scores. Thunder lost Tuesday against Indiana here on their whole floor. Washington drives it, cut off. Extra pass here. Hardie now on the drive. Hardie hangs and scores with a foul. On the initial drive. And now everyone on the floor will Oklahoma City take the full advantage of three. Kyrie Irving with that floater. Uncle Drew. Doing what he does best. Labyrinths. Can I get in there? Mine is their star. Oklahoma City up to the Ilta Sallix-Hander. Rise his up over Jones. Or what a midrange game he's got. On the driver Irving off the class. Look at maybe out. But there's still two huge stars out here on the floor. Come on and pass to Jalen Williams. He's capable. He knocks it down. He was wide open. He's Alexander. That Jones on him again. Now he fakes that jumper. Williams finds Holmgren. Research for the three. Got the feet behind the line. Chad Holmgren. Framing freeze here the last three possessions. Williams has 15. Kyrie Irving gets the contact. And he'll go to the line for a pair. Well Dallas have the opening possession. Dante X and was in the starting line up for Luca Doncic tonight. And he finds Kyrie Irving in a three-pointer is down. Goes the Salix-Hander. He keeps this run going. It's a drought here for the Mavitz. Gafford throws it down. Daniel Gafford. Gafford will double-double tonight. Kyrie put it on the die. But Gafford wasn't looking. It's been the shoulder. Look at that. What a finish. Josh Gidey can do that. A playmaker. Wilson's Salix-Hander's got 16. He backs lively out. Yolkis-Salix-Hander. Shot big. Contact. Count it. Yolkis-Salix-Hander just lost his dribble. Jones. Oh. Jalen Williams of the fensive highlight of the game. All's loose into the hands of Williams. Dallas turns it over again. Hayward stops. Pops. Fifth turn over on the corner for the Mavitz. In that case, there's only one opinion in that. That's right. Josh Demons of it. Mine doesn't matter. Yours doesn't matter. And more demos doesn't matter. Kyrie Irving. Thanks. Wallace and Squars. Excellent three-point shooting game for both teams. Examits his first three of the game. Yolkis-Salix-Hander from his spot answers. And he can really move. Exam falls down. Wallace is a menace right now, defensively. Exam's hurt. It's five on four. Exam's still on the other end of the four. And Case and Wallace. Berries a three. On a Thursday night. I don't have a couple of days off when they play Sunday. Hardaway hits another three. So Hardaway, come of the live here tonight. And finally. Exam, tonight by Kini. And now Hardee late clock got to put one up. Good so and gets it to go. 17 now for him. Very efficient. And his Hardee. And there's Gafford. And scoring he's doing. He is being left wide open for three. Another one wide open. And he buries one. That's his second made three. EJ Washington's now made his first shot of the night. He's missed eight in the row. He's over five. Three. Jalen Williams finds himself some room and around and down it goes. Ten turnovers in the second half here. And how about 32 points off those turnovers from Oklahoma City? Right away. Kyrie Irving sticks a three. And he's a Dallas lost on the road without Bukadanschi. That guy right there, Kyrie Irving didn't play in any of them. Washington's over six from three. Here's SGA. Williams gives it to Williams. Joe to Torch. Everybody gets a touch. And Thunder Basketball. Showing up here in the fourth. It's a Kyrie Irving. Irving behind the back. Trouble. Oh, score it. That was spectacular. That is a man's rebound right there. He'll just Alexander sidestown. Oh my goodness. Just running the highlight reels all night long. These two. This is two of the best guards in the game. And there's Kyrie Irving knocked him down another one. He'll just Alexander trying to deliver a finisher right here. And then he's got to get up. Williams for three. There's Wallace with the offensive rebound. Williams. And then I'm scrimmaging points. And they got it going here and Oklahoma City once again. This will take us to the finish line. The Thunder now up to one in this season series. Thank you.
