 I'm overall 14 and 12 on the road this year. 10 out of bio in the heat. Win the tip right now. 7th in the Eastern Conference are the games. Extremely hot last night in Milwaukee. The second half of the back to back for them. Not the way by Umbre. Maxi the Sunset. Up at it. Maxi. First in the NBA in steals per game. All the sixers just a bit shy. 9 takeaways of content. There's Kayla Martin who was hurt early in the last contest between us two on Christmas Day. Martin lays it up at it. That is the part of his game that has surprised me the most the playmaking ability at the willingness to make plays in fine teapot. I'm not there with you, buddy. Six assists in his first two games. And then time is season I would. 8 times in one day's win. He was really good. Make great decisions. Maxi on top to K. J. Martin for the rim rocker. John Spire for the new product early in this one. Just a fact. I've yet to go. So I can't wait to run away to the other. And now the heat's with an oop of their own. Duncan Robinson finding BAM on the Viya. So Tari's with five early tonight. K. J. Martin has five as well. 10-9-6ers. St. Claines. St. Claines. Well rebound. 11 assists for BAM last night in that win at Milwaukee. The oop's so good at the reset. Fibble. Second three. All ready tonight. For Buddy Heel. 12-13. It's the rest of the family that are in Texas. They all come up here. I know, but I was impressed. Buddy Heel. The lefty scoop and scope. K. J. Martin. Off run. Iron out of bio with it. Hero. To left hand. In the Kelly. Draws the foul. Hits the bucket. A three-point opportunity coming for Tyler Hero. 76-76. Heaths on them. 7-0. Ron to pull even with the six years here. 24-0. Tari's. Fibs the sixers. Bentley. Kelly Upray from outside. Off fire. Dandelogue. I was a rookie. I didn't have $100. Let alone $100,000. Robinson. Another from the left way. Actually, by the way, with 10. But Heel's 10 and the first on Monday. Buddy. And the swish. Third three already tonight for Buddy Heel. They don't mind taking those quick threes if it presents itself. Not everyone looks certain, guys. Nice. Falkers. Falkers. Falkers. Falkers. Falkers. Falkers. Falkers. Falkers. Falkers. Falkers. I absolutely don't even know what they're talking about. But I know they're pretty funny, though. How about Tennessee behind Broom, but it would be an rays target for everybody. Very cool, they would possibly be a new Kind of ball. gone in the second quarter. The little tear drop right in the middle of the lane. Hero threw the contacts, rattles in the 52% shooting the last three games. That's the first time he's done that in a three game stretch as a six-year KJ Martin, breaking the ring. RKJ Martin and the Eats. Miami-Honkaz Jr. actually competed in a high school slam dunk contest. Everybody buckets five threes and kept teams tonight. Away from our body. He also went to the Sanchez. Strips Maxi. Tari's furious about it. Again, the touch pass. Back to Robinson. Lays it up and in and is found. Scoops out the hero from the left wing. Paul Reed quickly had to mark now numbers for the sixers. Maxi, two is left. Yes, sir. Tari's Maxi rattles in another turn. Enough time to rebound or he just shoots. Couple of good shooters, Tari's. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. From Tari's Maxi. That will do it. For the first time here in South Rally. Unable to hit the bucket. Maxi the other way. He's fine. Gally, baseline, double pump up in it. For Gally, you break it. Nice bounce pass for Buddy Heels. Two for their last 11. And it seems that that is carried over from outside here. It's started this third quarter. Maxi, the scoop and score. Tari's Maxi. The all star this weekend. No fish. I had gotten away with the traveler. You heard somebody in the crowd yelling. Robinson quick trigger from outside. And Tom can Robinson loves those wing triples. Three for three now. Looks like Maxi loves to shoot. Tari's still trying to get that shoe back on. Here he's OK. Taking up a lot of that 24, making Miami defend. Gotta get back. Nobody gets back and picks up Duncan Robinson. I told you he didn't get there though. He didn't want to draw the charge. So he kind of let off a pull back in midair. Hey, after following his step on his left foot earlier in his quarter. Ricky counseled from way outside. And Ricky makes it. And the sixers retake the lead. Draw some things up. You try to regroup reset from this happens. Good stuff. All right. Tom John, a 1 foot and a kale of jurels at eight in counseling tonight. How about the presence in that quarter? Look here. Here's from outside. Shot clock at six. He's coming from the baseline. He comes over to help. Shot clock at two. One here. A watch is in hits. Kevin love it. Love it. Over there on the heat bench. He point by any lead. He'll 15 footers. What do you mean? Here's hero. Robinson could work by hands on defense and Duncan still able to rattle in the three. More than that. That's what makes him keep that city. If he can afford it, he's watching. We were looking at the latest things before the game. It's out of bounds. All alone. The other three on the floor. Continuing with the zone, approached defensively. It is a big bucket. Sixers needed. Hero. All right. Knocked it out. And they're going to say that that was a gold chance. I don't think so. The click of ball is in the circle. Did it? It's going to be a success. Connected to the play whose basketball interference prior to gold tending. Therefore, it's a successful challenge. It'll be filled up for your ball. They will not be charged a time off. And they will be able to challenge. Substant plays going forward. Five on the shot. Five. Robinson with five threes already tonight. Looking for his six. That one way off a present for Jaime Honkens Jr. Tariq stuck on 26 tonight. Hero from the yellow bow. We're looking shot. Tyler gets it to go. We're six. There's 32 and 21. Well, three, two zone there. Here's the key. The ball movement by the sixers. Paul reek powers it up in and draws the foul. Five point, he leads full court pressure to the sixers. 101 to play. It's not down. And that's going to be sixers basketball. Great work by campaign in KJ. Martin. This guy has 26 points. Actually, the left hand is plus five out of five. But it was coming down. That's a gold chance. That was himself a three-point game. There's directing his defense. Lee, open Robinson. No, Honkens. There for the weak side, Corpett. Two three minutes where Honkens has been first to that offensive rebound. Still 20. It's time for the sixers as Robinson fouls Maxi. I'm going to try to do the weak ends. And I look forward to seeing that. Looking forward to seeing this guy. This weekend too. Tariq's Maxi. Tariq hits the move. Hero pulls up, teens and shorts. So he's got to get the rebounds. And Otter-Bio comes away with it. And now they've got a foul. They drew that up perfectly. They got here to miss this shot. The rebound was there. Trying to revenge. You should have PJ there trying to block out Otter-Bio. And Hitsom makes it a two-possession game off the glass. Then you go get the ball. It's not enough to just block out. You have to go chase the ball. Tom's Maxi. Three to go. Two to go. Six to one. The rebound goes shot. So that great two-game win streak. So that's it. Two-game win streak. Two-game win streak. Two-game win streak. Two-game win streak. Two-game win streak. Two-game win streak. Two-game win streak. Two-game win streak. Two-game win streak. Two-game win streak. Two-game win streak.
