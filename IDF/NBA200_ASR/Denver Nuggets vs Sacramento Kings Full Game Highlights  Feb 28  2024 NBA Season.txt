 The first shot long distance is good and that is Keegan Murray. Murray sidesteps to a three. That's good. And we're tied as Kings on the road pretty good. 17 and 14. Now Murray's in the lane and rups it in. Murray coming in on quarter. And Perl had blocked it apparently got wide open for Mitchell. Pulled flutter on the way and go. Now Barys wide open look in the corner and Keegan Murray knocks it in. Jamal turns the corner. Coming in on support. And using the rim as an ally, nice play. Jamal Murray pours away inside and lay it up in it. Nice cut by Perl. If you can beat the physical nature in the grab and hold of Sacramento, you'll be OK. Pass out of the corner and Gordon stuffs it through. That's self-display by Jamal. Now Murray, three. And he gets the members bounce here at ball arena to bring the nuggets to within one. Now corner three was on the way for Mitchell. Three very nice shot. Reggie Jackson, points set hits. Now his first lead of the night, 1918. Sabonis put it up in. Once again with 40 consecutive double doubles, Munk basically brought it up in it. And just too easy. He got help to the inside. You know, he was doing a job guys a base up. But sometimes you can't. There's Malik Munk also from Kentucky. He lets it rip. That's good. Yeah, you double clunch and traffic in this lane. Four times a night. Bad things will happen. Yoke is at the lead. And a nice one to pay Watson. Murray's got 12 to shoot. CB rocks a three straight away. Murray's in the lane. Left hand scoffer is a beauty. Munk. Fits it up and in. Yoke is squirtless so far. Until right then. His first two. That's always a good sign. Munk gets switched. Long range three. Good at the buzzer. Kagan Murray. Munk gets with some porous defense. That's not good, Vos. In that first corner. Given a 35 points, Kagan Murray earned all the damage. He's just wide open most of the time. Murray, into the lane, shakes off the water. Banks it in. Ray Park, seek nausea. Alley, who wants some frozen down? That could be the igniter for the Denver Rugged Team. Murray running everybody light up and in. This guy looks like Michael Jordan re-incarnated here in the first inning. Munk is in the lane. He scores. Yoke is underneath the Reggie Jackson. That's a nicely executed one. Reggie Jackson, give it to Gordon. Gotta get Gordon involved. Yoke is laying it up and in. Nice pass. Good. Drop it. Hold it a foul. Reggie Jackson with a sweet dish. Yoke is over the corner. He fires for three. Gary Gordon's got a mouse in the house. And he puts it in the air. And a foul. Second corner, glad you with us on altitude. The Nuggets tried it. And Supponus, strong set up it in. The Amata Supponus. He's a candidate for all NBA honors. This season, I think Yoke is in the land. Drops it up and in. So, Supponus got two. Yoke gets two back. Pass underneath. Reggie Jackson right there. Cook shoot it. Colton will. Well, he knows it. That's a head in the pass by Aaron Gordon. Gordon taking charge. Taking charge. As he is manhandling some kings down low. And the pass is thrown away. Give it to Yoke. Take it. He's got a five. Mom, Mia. As Nick Lombardi might say. Over the Murray. He fires. And gets. That's selfish. Inside Yoke gets flip it up. That's good too. And a nice flip by Supponus. The Malik Mork. Supponus. And Supponus misses. He's going to put this in a way. He got away. We cleared out a joke. A breath. And so just grinning and walking down the floor. Gordon over the Murray. Murray. On a fire at triple. Got it again. Under the Murray. Murray. Got a little link for her shoot. Got it. Over Harrison Barnes. Porter. That's it. Rip. Got it. Supponus battling Yoke tonight. Two of the best centers in the league. Under the bar. And Barnes hammers at home. Murray's got it. Six to shoot. Murray in the lane. Corkscrew. Go, Ma. Jumal Murray at his. You say he's got the best turn around jumpers. It's overhades. Jumal gets put it up in. In. Onakola Yoke gets. They're 12 points. Go up up. Intercepts him. Here he goes. He just ran back. Miles to beat the clock. No good. Supponus the rebound. Put it up. And in. Love. Now Murray. Porter's got a look for three touch shot. Now's it. MP with a long jade. Porter's on the line. By his man. Score it. Kings wanted a treble. And yeah. Michael Treble right all the way to the basket. 21 point lead. On. Edify Murray with a little hudini action there. Nuggets a made eight of 10. Sat just two of eight. Now three of nine. Now Nick Munk. Gordon. That is away. Remember the Nuggets played him all night. Now it's over. Gordon's got one on one here. He's doubled. Wide open his KCP. Pops a three. Miles for three. Got it. Yokey's with it. Colwell Pope. 95 68. Watson in the lane. 15 point. Like that play. As he thought about it. Colwell Pope. He checked. Got it again. Dwarke for three. And a nice play. Just that. I'm not closing a quarter out. You got up 32. Dwarke for three. And Michael Malone calls time out. Dwarke. And he scores it. Watson the ground. And Christian puts it up and in. And that's how you take the contact in the finish. E-T to change. Murray knocks it in. Dwarke. In on Z. Hey! Zick shoves it down his throat. And another block. And Len cleans it up. And Dwarke knocks it in another triple. And Michael Malone is hot now. Want to Murray up the pole and he gets. Murray, let's it go. That's good again. So Zipoaness. He's one rebound away from his 41st consecutive. Yeah, this is a double. This is a get this stat to keep the streak going. Inside Keegan Murray. So Keegan Murray who's had a 47 point game this season. He's got 17. Holy, he's got a big man turned two. Got it. Let him sell out crowd here at ball arena. Fuck. And Murray gets two there. Hup for three. Banks it in. There you go. Keegan Murray coming in. Close it down with authority and a little smirk. Quarter three yes. Hunter Tyson knocks it in and the bench likes that. Land. Oh, and he banks it in. Edwards choke dots. Good defense by Zipoaness. And hold the reverse. Warthay. A munder is coming. It will be that is holding someone under a hundred. And good friends. Michael Malone. Thank you.
