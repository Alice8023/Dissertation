 to play golf, do not give him strokes. So I guess what they also hit the grisys with a delay again to start this one. Simon's to get short good with. Simon's loose is splitting and good one with a steal. Grisys out looking to run. They are Williams, Randle Ford, never got it. And three made by Fort Goodman. So he does a great job. Good knee best day in the front of Simon's. It would have picked up the basketball. You get the thrill on the other end and you see Jeremy Grant. Minnesota the other night. Good one creating a little space just to teaser. Did by Jefferson Roseanne. Oh, man, Murray out of the corner for three. GG Jackson in the game for the first time tonight. Aldama comes out, shot clock down to three. He's got a good shot. I'm going to play with him. I'm going to play with him. I'm going to play with him. And then the first time tonight, Aldama comes out, shot clock down to three. Jameson with that little hook. Everyone, he comes out for his pregame warm up. Teams that don't shoot well. That would certainly be for him. Vince drives into lane. Broder got it. Murray sets up Simon's. But Vince closes out on him. Fibles drives and hits. The tease Fibles. Everything just five points again. The first time tonight. Fible for three. Off it's a rebound and a finish by Jabari Walker. Fourth turnover on Portland. Orally, they're fairly ball-seeker. Don't play at a particularly high pace. Or maybe a drive-screased contact score. 37% of their points from their bench. Hey, it's creating space. Gigi Jackson, Jack Lock lining down. Trying to create off the bounce. Which is up in. And then, he beat the shot clock. Gigi Jackson. Get everybody organized offensively. Jack Lock down to five. From our Steven's. One on one. Fade away jumper. Yes. And armed. Well, yeah, Dick Cooker said it was a clean block. A lob. Not well played. But it's up. It's in. Score the basket between Brooklyn and the Clippers. It's only average four points again. Grizzies. Kneed down to one. Aldama going last. The three of the laps. There have been some changes. Aldama. Fible a ball fake. Gets a back from Higgins. And Fible now top of the arch three puts it in. Matisse Fible. It's a quickness. And then his quickness to athleticism. To be able to finish over taller defenders. Jeremy Grant tries for three and gets six of the night losses by 10 more points. La Ravia for three. Franco. Tell the opposing everything. Jake La Ravia. He could defensively play by La Ravia. Took the ball away from Moses Brown. Then lost it. Brown late getting back. Now gets an easy one. Back in front. Hustle won one and defensively. Because it would have knocked that three down his branch. It's all of its to the basket. Jeremy Grant now with seven. For the Blazers on high screening roles. Are dropping all the way down with the flex for rights of handsome and for the late. You know, a lot of the bandit with the finish. Screens being set to the biggest thing is trying to keep those legs in. And don't have such a wide base that gets outside of the shoulder. Jeremy Grant laces the three. Portland goes back up. Rebound defensive. Fathom driving all the way through and lays it up in. Simon's behind a brief screen. And Anthony Simon's a screw. Fuck it to the game. And there's five of them again. Two on one. Five of them takes it himself. And before remaining in the fast moving. Basketball game. Moravia. Forks should turn around. Double who's in and it might as well here. Six on the shot clock. ZT Jimisin and he has a block. The pass is better deep. Simon's how to run out. Break opportunity and it's finished. Five blocks and seven steals already. Shot clock down to three. Zahir off balance going last and banking it in. It sounds a little bit of something in terms of some role play. Jeremy Grant with a list. Fimit remaining. And Lamar and Steven's go up strong to the right. For a tap. Rissie down four. Zahir. Now Vince on the baseline. Rissie. It's almost reversed enough and in. Pretty played by Vince William Jr. He's got it. In terms of their size on the floor. Simon's on a blow by. Rissie saw that. His brother's continue to one or seven. Murray with a drive off the glass and in. Grant. He's got a new career high in scoring this year. Simon's laced the green. Brimley shoot at decent percentage. Mid-range shots. This will take very many of them. Green finally drops in a three. The confidence of being healthy for the first time in a long time in six. Has done him very well. Now Murray drops in a three in the Brucey's golf time. Ventures have been very productive tonight. Al Dama at the data line. Vince. Three by Zahir. Yes. So we're going through the motions a little too much. They're playing looser. They're playing with more confidence. They're playing with more fun. He said do we want to get in all of our feelings the rest of this game? Shot. No. When he off it's been. Now look, Deandre, it's not going to play now a steal by Murray and a doctor. And that's been the story of the night. He's caught on seven years of age out of LSU. And it goes strong to the rack and finish. Infliction's per game. First half of his title. Second half has been pretty much everybody else. Al Dama to the baseline. I'm really good game tonight. And Simon's contribution has been fairly limited. Only seven points. GD rainbow three is good. Oh, Leravia, a wide over three. Yes. Leravia, three for three for distance and a tie-out. Take it. This is need to reverse. A trend here is struggling in the second half. Zahir on the attack. That's good to see Przaya Williams. He's got nine. Leravia, guarded by Simon. Leravia working on a clear night. Lamar Stevens for three. Tegans, drives and banks it in after Hagans. Goodwin's pass. Deflicted by Thibal. Lobfervantis. I'm out of rhythm. Entries to your major plays. The real bulls. To guard Walker. Forces. Nine on the shot clock. Bantan, a step back three. Hits it. A lot of Bantan. Ran. This is the three. Walker, no look to five. And the Grizzlies golfing time. And forced turnovers again. Stevens, turn around over Walker. Put again. Walker. And the foul. The barry Walker. No five man lineup has played more than 68 minutes together this season. That was a lineup that had Xavier Tumman in it. Brown checks in. Get to Don. Portland has had this year. They had a 32 point lead at home against Utah. They had a 32 lead by 29. Bantan. Wow. The efforts are great against the upper Escalante. Those are ones you get up for. They got to find a take there to make this out here. You got to find a way to get yourself ready. Prepare. Walker, a little euro step and a finish. Jabari Walker. A 30 point win. 69 bench points before.
