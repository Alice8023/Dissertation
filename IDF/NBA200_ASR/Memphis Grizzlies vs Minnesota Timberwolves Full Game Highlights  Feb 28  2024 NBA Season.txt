 We are underway. Why not running back to back games by the corner and the uniforms back to back. Jared Jackson. That's a bit of back court violation instead. It's Mitch Williams in the tray. Aldama is scoring up from D. Can't hit. Tipped in by Zaire Williams. How about this? Stroud. He's been accustomed to not take a seat until the wolves get their first points. Aldama makes it 12. Nothing meant this. Like picked up this dribble early. Yeah, awkward. Sequence there for Conley. Jackson lays it in its 14th zip. They got killed by the Brooklyn nets and you know the Memphis just did not come out and play it on. All the titles finally. We've been continuing to execute offensively. One for six so far. Edwards crossover. Spinning. Tuffay. Pugh. In a training. Over the head cast. Broken up. Liz Lee started five for six. They missed the last five. Good one. Outside look for Aldama. Hits another three. Conley. Outside. McGanniel squares up. And hits the tray. Reed pushing the tempo. Nearly lost the handle. Edwards. Inside takes the contact. And scores. And that's two fast break opportunities. The walls haven't been able to convert. This is Derek Rose inside. Good upcoming of all the injuries that they've had is Zaya Williams and Gigi Jackson for sure is Towns Knocks Down the three. Outside look. Knives Reed. Pass. What's it now? Over a jacks and nice spin. And the flush by the rookie. Right. He gets picked. He gets picked at 45. Definitely would say higher than 45. And there he is right on two. Of our Steven. Required in the trade at the deadline. I was Jackson way outside. He is not shy. Reed behind the bat. Kick out. Alexander Walker. For three. Reed for three. Money. What's that? There's a friend out of the corner. They curve him out of the corner. They curve him out of the corner into actions. But handing it off to him in transitions. Such a great way to get him into space. And I'm a fan of all the stuff that they've done in Memphis. McLaughlin stays red hot. The closeout on Jackson at that time. Watson Navi. Over to LaRavia for three. And it's good. They work it around to Watson Navi nearly lost the handle. Steven's in the corner. Watch by McDamons. Steven's in the paint. The pull-up is good. Grizzlies average about nearly 15 turnovers again. Here's Conley calling in the air. Getting to McLaughlin. Setting up Navi's read for three. That's going to be huge right there. Morris. Outside look. Why did they leave Navi's read open? He could hit that. This shot rebound inside by Jordan Goodwin. Jackson stepping into a tray and he hit it. The others to the limit turned out to stand two in Memphis. That was a heck of a ball game. Morris counted and put him on the line. Hand off the Edwards three ball. Parsley blocked by Zaire Williams. And Williams. Finishing the lob at the rim. Had a bounce. Yeah. That had a turnover for the Grizzlies. Quickly ahead. McDamons. Oh, mom. You sort of has eight turnovers in the game to match Memphis. Sounds as four of them. Jackson with the dunk. Goodwin on the drive. Over to Aldamma. Left it short. Bandit out. Williams will fire. And hits. Remember that one. It has been a really good defense of rebound team this year too. It's it's uncustomed back for them to be able to give up that many second chance points. It makes a really hard shot. Second chance points are just piling up. 14 nothing advantage now. No box out from Ant out of the corner that time. Zaire Williams. Wolds attended over 11 times. Alley U. And Wals. And a training. Euro. No. Go bare. The follow slam. McDamons. Throw it up. We have not seen that connection off. Been a hell of a. From McDamons to go bare. Spread down the lane. Without any interference. Here's calmly over to go bare. Laying it in. It's 20 to 16 now. And a hamstring straight. It is not playing this game. Not at uniform. Towns. It's the jumper. It's Chris Finch said we just have to do a better job at protecting the rim. And guys a lot of talking. Especially from Mike Conley saying we have to communicate. We have to talk out there. Anthony Edwards also saying we got to play defense at one point. And then he's left with a 16 to advantage in second chance points. Good win. Rattles in a try. So Grizzly seen the game ready for a fight. Edwards. Right down the lane with the hammer. I just don't see the angle in complaining every single time. And another bucket. From Jaren Jackson Jr. He's 20 now and on the night. Six in the last meeting between these two teams. Here in Jaren. Three going to work. Bucket in the pocket. Memphis has been able to score her teams. He's through second chance points and hit. Jim Jackson is a big part of that. But Williams. Three in the corner. I was re-battling in the post. Towns. I'm going to be able to get the point of the cutting. Edwards, get out the way. Jackson giving it up again. Good win. The float along goal. Towns the strong rebound. Got an advantage but you got to watch out behind Edwards. Williams. No. Raybound McDaniels. Minnesota running again. Alexander Walker. We got barris at home. Mike Brooklyn is not. No. Come on down. And number one, opportunity. Wolves by three. Matching their largest lead of the night. Williams. I'm waiting on Alexander Walker and got the bucket. Got to get back. Moore is still on the floor. It's five on four as Aldama. Okay. Gets it back. Three ball. No goal. And tap that of there. Vince Williams has it for the Grizzly. Stevens with the dunk. Two point game. Michael Grady, Jim Piedeson, Katie Storundis, and GG Jackson. And Zachy Gobert and getting the role. He doesn't look like a 19 year old dozen. Oh, nice bounce pass. Edwards. Towns with the block. Wolves have numbers. Vince Williams not in the play yet. And the attack. Get them. Edwards. All the drive. Jackson. Rick. Rebound. Towns. Marshall get another one. Up ahead. Yes, sir. And then it'll come up short. Thank you.
