 You ready? You game? I'm game. It'll be Jolma. It'll be Brooke Lopez, Attenfraer, Curtis Blair, and Penuzzy Ransom, the three officials tonight, and we are underway here in downtown Sack. Ellen is drawing to match up here on Dame Lulish. See Dame trying to sneak that baseline. Shot clock at two. Nice defense of possession, Swipe. It says, give me that deer with the block in transition. T.O. for shot. They are excited to have the opportunity to see the against the Bucks. Nice backdoor cut. Crowder got away with a foul box. O out to B, Harrison Barred, knocking down the three. The red belted. Lulma's the little look away. Erner, over Lopez, and Sacramento opens up the game on the NATO run. That's beautiful. That's something that we don't really see very often. His work, Domas, keeps it in fakes that G.A. Joe. But Kevin Hurtz was already into the layup. Yeah, it looked easy. Bumbles to pass a little bit there, but he was wide open on the cut. Those cuts are what's going to be important for everybody tonight. Hurtz. Got it. Lulish, guarding. He got all the way to the rim. That's over two Kings. And I was walking by, and I saw Yannis warming up today. He's a massive human being. So is that got to Wild Howard, nobodies? He's putting all of Milwaukee. Barnes, he's been man on fire like Denzel Washington, three, three, Hurtz and I got one for you too. Red velvet now with two triple, and Kennell walked there. He went from the booth to the sideline transition counthead. And Doc came out and said, you know what? It belongs to the staff, Adrian Griffin as well. And run a double head Yannis. Beverly relocates to the corner. They'll push shot at what. They're going to call Alex Lenton with that foul. Oh, nice cut and fine. Drey Liles now. Collects it. Spotsie. Nice kick out to Malik, corner three, got it. Oh, Fox trying to push Green and Blender. The air fox, like for Barbara, two chicken in the first quarter here for Sacramento. Now on 14 made vocals, so that says a lot. The air fox, the hey, that was over Patrick. You got Pat Bev on him and he just pulls up right in his face and knocks it down. Yannis knows gets the rebound. Oh, Yannis with the hammer. And they're going to call foul. Man. Yannis getting down hill with the hammer. We just saw the stat there with his dome. He's now eight or 13 from distance. The busts don't even proving effective here in start to second quarter. And he's got to be able to slow Yannis down. Back to that eight point lead. This Patrick Beverly came over and trained with the sixers back in February. And he's made a difference. There are certain players in this league that are going to get to the free throw line. And Yannis is one that has that respect. Yes, second in the NBA in three and a half. Three sharp to the note. Here comes Malik, head esteem here. Month, one on three. Oh, a little fancy dribble. Oh, the curly shuffle out of him. Their third foul on the night. Meanwhile, the king with nine. Five. Oh, he's jacked it on Connident. They will. Working to get Harrison Barnes, little stoop. Cameon Lillard, 12-year man out of Weaver State. That's how I view it. That's not a lot of contact. Lead on the scone with yourself in. Unable to cash in. Don't mosh. Yes. How about that? The rip and run. The mosh is subonus. You got to really try and find a way of focusing on trying to take that away from right. He has not and made it yet, but he's fantastic. He's a little... Well contested, still knocked it down. Shooting almost 44% on the season. But there's Timasa, subonus, that little midi. He goes to that slow-yuro step to find himself some time. And this is a scrappy King-C where it's in. Ah, he on, handsome. Yeah, Golden State had lost by 50 to Boston, and then came back and beat the Bucks by 30 plus. And Yannis, he's getting his stats tonight. He's got 18. Well, it's 3-15 from 3-point range. Meanwhile, Donbass triple team on the inside. Malik, man, Malik Mo. He has come out, standing on his business tonight. King shooting, scissors, 64%. Here's the air box. Mighty Donbass, oh man. Okay, so not the subonus. In the basket. Has posterized his twice in the first half. Yannis on the comeback. Bucks, working on Lillard. Bucks off the planet. Counted. The air box with 15. And that's going to do it the first 24 minutes in the book. Dame Lillard, they've done a great job. Just four points for him. One of sevens from the field. You know that that's probably going to shift here in the second half. But you just got to keep working to be a cent. That you did through those first 24 hals. The 50s in Yannis. Short arms one. It comes here in Fox. King's up 21, Foxy. Oh my god, over Yannis. A D3 from here. He's got 18s. He didn't know for this quarter. Yup. They've done a lot of eye-so with Yannis without a combo as a blade. You like to get down hills and passes it off and Dame knocking down his first triple of the game. Yannis on the spin cycle. Yannis now with 26. I gave out there over three point lines. So you got it held down and that's going to lead Dame open. Don't mind switch the put back. Down it. Fox picked his pocket. Deer it. Flight number five. Has taken all been landed. How difficult is it to adjust as a player on a fly? Not playing with guys and rotations or use them. You know what? I think that's the way that the team is playing. The neighborhood will get the bucket instead. Here comes Bobby Portis. Mid-range jumper got it. Bobby Portis. Extra pass. Davia. Corner pass. Got it. Oh, bad no. I'm going to pop. He went to the right. He's going to grab that one. Going a little bit everything tonight is Deer. Here he is. Turn it on the jet. He has going to foul on jumper. Their defense is purely healed. They're offence. Oh, Deer. Fox. They're late. We're unable to catch it. But HBO has it far. Got you back. Say what? We've had a lot of teams come in here. He's getting on Ellis's face to the baseline. And they've cheered their season off. It's good to see somebody finally struggled for three ball ring. First side of a back to back. We got LeBron and the Lakers tomorrow night. And Goma's fully ball over Pat Connident. About 27. LeBron and Jake Raine. Two small he said. Follows his own shot. Fox. High archi 3. And that's something Deer and Fox and Luke Glau have worked on. He gave them all the face. Yeah, it's my move. Goma's 22 and 11. Five. Oh, making it rain in Sacramento. Deer and Fox. Got her before the season. Here's your bell. Back out to Chris. Three balls. Keep it on him. I'll be curious to see the kind of path that is at the age of eight. Oh, Chabelle. Pat yourself and I, sir, you deserve it. There's Lawson trying to guard Gallonari. AJ Green. Little tough Flutter. Oh, Andre Jackson, Jr. has adopted by crowd he didn't have for it. He long time coaches of the best in the game.
