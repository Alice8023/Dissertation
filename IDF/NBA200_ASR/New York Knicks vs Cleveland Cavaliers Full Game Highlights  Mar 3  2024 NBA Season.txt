And now Darius goes comfortably. And is limping back up the floor. Garland. Yes, I ride, Alan. So many guys coming and going with the two in-season traits. Fighting that chemistry is still a work in progress. Steven Chinzo. No. No, no, no, no, both of these got it. Outlet picked off by Hart. Dante from deep. Tracks it down himself. McBride, good relocation on the perimeter. Okay, meetings. So we don't just have to take threes. We've got to make them. They've been making them early in this ballgame. Mobile inside. Terrific rebound for the Knicks after the early injury in the first minute of the game to Jalen Brunson who has not returned to the bench for the Knicks.
