 You ready? You game? I'm game. Shandgun at the elbow gives it to Jalen Greene got hold of way to the rim of the score. Lashley. If it goes like that, we're good. The coaching staff stayed away from that one. Terrence Mann inside, knocks at home and the clippers are on the board. Terrence Mann, he walks it across. Play a little stack pick and roll, heart knock to screen, got down hill and scores. Brookes one more to the corner of green. Nice sidestep for the rim. I mean the trajectory of that jump shot is so flat. Rory Smith, a little more arc on that three ball. Used enough by four, a hard one. Got to the rim, counted and won. Greene for beat, got it. Hasitated a little bit. Shandgun on the block against Tice. Reels the reverse counted. Slim and Cam Whitmore, Joc Landale sets the screen for holiday. Whitmore for three on the fly by got it. There is a skill fit. In 12 points a game in his rookie season on 36% from downtown. What a great fit. He's been for the rockets this year. Power pulls and connects. The final runner that I've counted out front. Draws two, Highland. Holiday was all defense of the pack 12. He couldn't stop, bone stove. He scores a few weeks with Russell Westbrook, out with that fractured hand. Break defensive hustle by Whitmore. Shot clock down to four. Georgetown's to launch. Just got it off. And just the way they drew it up. One of the things I admire most about this is efficiency, but he looked great in the fourth quarter and 0-2. Whitmore, oh, great. He's flying charter. He's dead three. That's going to be a little bit short. Whitmore on the run out, great catch and traffic, and he got the lefty lay. Oh, he's going to say that. And Shingun gets the board. Whitmore leaking out, steps through, score it. Oh, he's slick with it. Cam Whitmore with nine quick points. Heck of a rebound by Shed Goo to good push ahead. Leonard with the mid-rage. I Leonard with four points on two of down by 12 under seven minutes to go in the half. Whitmore left all of the low. They went under the screen, Doris, and he makes them pay. Ty Lue is chewing the time out. Gonna let them play. Leonard says, I got it. Don't worry about it, coach. Back to Macpuckets where Kauai can tell, let's game last night. No doubt of the victory over him. They give it up in the fourth quarter. Jason Tatum have a chance to win it. Snap their 11-game winning streak, Terrence Mann. They clear out the side for him. Working against Jason Tate now, double team comes from Brooks. And with Kauai sometimes it from D. This despite the fact that he's shooting over 40 percent on the season. Shen Gune with that one-handed shot. It's not off one leg. It's the blue. That pass he'll advise. Didn't make it. Leonard coming back the other way a little over two minutes to go. Kauai knocks home the three. Norman Powell, one of the leading candidates. Jason Tate had an ocean fall, George. Great perimeter defense coming back the other way. They got a three on two. Carden steps through. Lays it home and the lead is down to 10. Is that a reason why keeping you attached to Shen Gune? Paul George matchup. Cross-court to Bansley. One more to Brooks from D. And he catches it. Dylan Brooks on the board with his first meal though. Leonard. Little guard guard screening action. He rejects the screen. Leonard with those massive hands with reverse. Will not hesitate to go small. So at their best to beat the Clipperist is Jabar. It gets a shot to go. What they make? They shoot on Leonard. Couple of lower teammates champions with the Raptors in 2019. Paul George laces the mid-range. He's got four just his second meal. George on the bounce, working off the dribble against Bansley. George great time in the reverse slam. Plumbly on Shen Gune in a crowd out to Bansley from D. Got it. But again, you want him to pick the roll because he's emerging as a very talented switchable for in this league. George starting to find his rhythm and flow. Paul George from the wing drawing a lot of attention. There's the double team green from three-point territory. Laces it. We got the switch to Bansley. His former Toronto teammate. Play with his food now. Ross Court one more to Terrence made for three. Cash out. And the lead is down to 10. 11 points in the game. All George discovering his rhythm a little bit. Working off the bounce. Little quicks in dribble. And scores it over Smith. BG third hand lead coming back the other way. Pop the clutch out to green. One more to Smith. And the three-point beat continues for H-down. There I mean, he's an important beat. There's no question about it. And Tyson's done a good job. But obviously you want everybody healthy and ready to go. He makes him more dangerous. Terrific. Ooh. It's pretty sometimes slowly seems to be figuring it out. 13 of the ballgame. For a koai in a phone booth found man. What a dime drop by koai liner. And it moves down the half thing self the night right now. He's got to clean Tyson's side with the punch. Drives it on Powell. Tough shot. Comes off to koai liner on the fly. Looking around Tyson. Got the dime and lays it home. What a look by Thompson. Oh, it's stayed in front of him well. Shane Goen though with great position. But it's a fender on liner. Lender got it back after losing it. That line drive never had a chance. The second one did. The quarter which helped them slice into that lead. And 36 points into court. Powell on the drive comes off to Cam Whitmore. Whitmore back to Shengoon. Spins wheels fires. Passives get to know the name nationally. It's Alperin Shengoon. They already know who busy bones is. Gets that layup to go. And his best a member of the NBA's. All defense team. Thompson inside. Got it to fall over Paul George. How about the pass from Shengoon? They're all ready to know who busy bones is. Get that layup to go. How about the pass from Shengoon? Harden goes tween. Got into the rim and got to the paint and scored it. Got Thompson on a harden. Family with the hard roll rejected at the rim. Coffee to George. A scores it. Eight on the shot clock. Harden got by him. Sprays it out to quiet. Lender for free. Got it. He's got a levity. The point of attack. Shengoon spins. The jump hook good over. Plumly. 18 in the ball game to go. Lender to get swit. Straight on strength. And that's goi lima. Run a little away action for Powell. Comes off for three. Goop call by Ty Loom. He's got 11. Goop call. He's got a clean up at one away. Kali fires. And we are tied at one away. He's slender to win. 20 on the roll. Shengoon blocked by plumly. Has an answer to a tones at the defensive end. Harden. Lender. Sprays it out to the corner for the lead. George got it. Splash. That's the catch. He has a clear turn. A little machine gun trouble. The midi. And one. Goal one. Smith with ghost of screen. Got open. Great action out of the ring. So efficient. Chipari Smith. Total difference. Harden with the second ring throw. Shengoon with little room service underneath. To make it a six point lead. And that is Scott. Harden's buddy. And rap star. Ford side. Other than that, it worked out the way that James Harden would like to do his team. Victoria's 122. Thanks for watching.
