 fifth 51 visits record. Four teeth in the east. They have lost 14 straight have not won a ball game since at San Antonio. And they'll love to find the win column in this game coming back home after three tough losses. Kuzma starts to score and as your rules it up inside for two. Wizards how Kuzma with a open landing to the loop. Shamanic, lob it up, put it down. John Collins, a little early bang, bang play. Bagley hands it off, Koosma the wiggle against Hendrick, puts his shoulder down, no call. Shamanic trails the baseline, but a little bit late, Leech's up, tried to save the bucket. Well, he is going to test Lucas. A lateral movement, you got to play angles. Oh, Taylor Hendrick's dials deep. You cannot underestimate the importance and the work it takes to stay on an NBA roster and make Shamanic's learned that the hard way. Sexton dribble, dry stops on a dime. Inside, nice move by the rock. Ball stripped away, up, Deeta. Drop it, put it up, put it up, the follow by Collins Sexton. Now he's good for four and a half assists again. And it puts up a beauty. Tyus Jones, who's been playing extremely high level of weight. They gave him an assist. Koosma rips the net from downtown. Inside Collins, great recovery. And then throws it away, Tyus Jones just passed it. The mid-court line, he'll dial up three, got it. Chris Dunn's coming in two now, and I like this because Keote was questionable with an illness. Chris Dunn's going to bring a little energy right now, and I think the jazz could use that particularly on defense. So that stops about a three minute drought for the jazz. As Koosma goes by dribble, right to left, to drive it. To Bagley, and that's an easy dunk up top. Collins went out of my marion, and Bagley kind of gets one of his own on the other side. I love that shot. He's driving, he's stopping pop. He's fast and furious, but his pace, his patience, that little last pull-up, that showed that he can change speeds of his career. What about that one? Collins sex in the pure three-pointer. 138 block shots this season. Pulled me in Miami, making progress. Sexton gave it up, and I like that. And Keote makes the well aware of that, Bullock, because they want to try to get to going. Wow, sexton delivers the assist. He's jumping. And John Collins, he made a play by Drought, and the defense on him, and passing it to D.H.T. Six turnover, gives Bull a chance, and how about 10? Do this trilogy of NBA woes and highs. 22-year-jump. Johnny Davis, oh, what a spin. Come on. No, no. Put the shot up. Johnny Davis, front court. Shot. Three. Up and good as he does that. Well, Luke is first, wants a little bit flat. As a player, you better be a little bit more wrecked out on the fly. Johnny Giseng has checked in, number 43 for Utah. Playing the first quarter, scores his first block at JC. Little jab step. Bump. Hespace. Juppercut. Mark some of the six point half. The bag lead. Pool. I'll tear the green lights on. There's a silver. Short and all three attempts from downtown, another rebound for back lead. Pool attacks. And one. Juseng will put pool up on the line with 17 points. Utah turnover. That's far in his first half. Over the top. JC wide open three. Go ahead. Parks and try to re-light that play from downtown to last five games. Well, that's a few that aftertack about play. Good pool. Dan comes back with an answer. There'll be an interesting offseason for both of these franchises. Lies he enough to shot. Back to section. One more time, Colin. Plets a double team on defense. Gun, Colin. Nice rebound. Look for an early look here. THC rolls at downhill. Cups it. Scores it. One. The jazz are understanding the pace of the Lizzy's great pass by Colin S. To right there. The Janet Juseng. He understands what's needed in the game. He just puts his mark on it. Inside. Bagley. Dumped out. Colin. Off the wing. Backside rebound. Quick outlets. In a flush. Off the deal. Sexton in the paint. Close it. Short. Balls loose. One man. To be. Dung tries to help. The cruise my runs right by him. Looking for ISO. He's got it up top. Back's out the dribble. Left hand. Splits the two defenders. Stop. Drops it. Hits it. Good. Good. Good. Defending the screener. Can't leave too far to the screener. He's got to get back to Jordan. Here's Chris Dung. First attempt of the second half. The JC gets the start with Sexton and Dung. Shamanage and Colin. Oh yeah, you got it. I like that shot T. Oh for four. Well, the bench breaks. Let's see who wants to play. That ball by Dung flies over Colin Sexton. There's a quick shot. Tiest Jones. Back pedals after the triple. Here's Sexton on the drive. In the paint. Splits the double team. Step back. Juppert. A round of knock. Colin's offensive rebound. That's a big bucket. Four blocks ago with 12 points in nine rebounds. Tiest Jones coming right back. There's over three minutes played in this third quarter. Yes. Back to work. Colin's inside. Tough shot. But a beautiful pass from Jordan Clarkson. Jack Collins with a 14 point game. Ten at the hand. Jones for three. That is Jones is just. Quick throw the corner. Brace steel. Shaman. It's took away from Fuzema. Sexton to the bottom. The bucket. Tiest Jones passes out. Fuzema steps inside the three-point line. The triple finds its way down. Yes, JC 20. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Yes, JC 22. Here's Kuzma. Dows up deep. Brice and Tabaza. Unhamed. The shot. Tiest Jones cross-score pass. What a shot. Jordan Poole just came out the bench. You're on base, got to. The triple to nice pump face. How about John Collins? In the rhythm. Coming up on the four-minute mark. Talk about a good set of Tiest Jones just leaves it. He's sensible. He is moped and that shot never got out of his hands. He take it away. Poole. Now, sensible lift hand, triple. Those five baseline stops. Boom. Got the shot. Got it. Takes a little press. That's back. A whisper. Look right back at him. You guys have really stepped up and started performing well for them. You know what I'd say? What the world you're doing just swimming in? Just a lot of good stuff. Yes. Kuzma. Poole. Got away from TXT. Stop, splotter, good. He's a rebound magnet, first of all. He's a very cerebral player. So he doesn't hurt you at all. He knows what he's doing. He's turning. Kuzma. Oh, Gia. I pick out of Israel going to work slides by Shamanich. M.A. have been his easiest two of the night. Clarkson chases down the mess. He's a mid-court. Gries paints Corston. Clarkson. JC. At the free throw line. It's done. Surveys the floor. Gounces him back inside. JC. Push it. Score. Got a hurt. Forty shoot. Got it away. TXT. TXT. Just inside the free throw line. Chris Dunn coming into this game and his deepest has changed this quarter. The second half could be touched as defensively. JC kicks it open in. This has been a gutty performance for you, Tom. A top in scores. That was Collins. Are they giving it to Sexton? And Clarkson rightly so. Rebound's the last shot in Utah. The first shot in Utah. The first shot in Utah. The first shot in Utah. The first shot in Utah. The first shot in Utah. The first shot in Utah. The first shot in Utah. The first shot in Utah. The first shot in Utah. The first shot in Utah. The first shot in Utah. The first shot in Utah.
