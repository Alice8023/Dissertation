Let's read the Lakers and the Kings, James. Now the floor is just died. We're gonna go down to Sacramento, California, golden one center. Get ready for a Western conference still. Let's read the Lakers and the Kings, James. Now the floor is just died. Let's go down. Reaves, catch fire, heads, heads, heads. Here's Barnes working behind the Seabounders. Barnes, kicks to the corner, another look for Ellis. Now what is going? Russell finds Reves. A three-use goal in Austin Reves, puffing in the early going. He has the first eight-leaker point as Hotja Mara skates in for two. She's even hotja Mara Genshin. He's been shooting it well from three. The whole team has... Ryan the corner. But he still can have a fun case. Already down. As Reves is dead, the hot. The Austin Reves is going to push the time out from Sacramento. Murray stops the late inning. Dilo is feeling good with the quotes that have been coming out of his mouth over the last couple weeks. The other day talking about... I want all the smoke on the killer. Yeah. And a lot of interesting things. You better be playing well. Yeah, exactly. It's not Jamura again taking advantage of his size advantage. Aw, quick move. Boom! To the right. Oh, Reves off the delivery from James. Banks it in. Beautiful pass from LeBron James. Hotja Mara using his size on Mitchell finishes. As... That was... Nice little confident in between game there. Mara can get it to go. Wow, what a rebound from Davis. And Davis raises it in. Here's Sabonis spinning inside. Twisting his way. In for two. Nice steal there for Deer and Banks. Pull up three. No. Follows it up. How about the mid-range? Yeah. Here's Monk. Leaving flipping and finishing. That is a beautiful move from a loose month. Sorry, in Prince body Z in and gets the roll. Russell to Davis. Good chemistry there. Here's Lynn has to let it fly. And knocks it down. A long two for Alex Lynn. Ellis waits and finishes. Here's Russell at it, not the way by Ellis. Oh, Jackson Hayes flies into collected and finished. Erie, he got it. Such a sweet stroke from three. It looks easy. James pops it in plus the foul. And King James still hanging with all of them. That's something he has done at a career level. Ellis, no hesitation. Hey, Foxy's out. Erie gets another jumper to go. Double comes. They swing it. Reaves attacks the closeout. Hashemura, Pax. Beautifully executed possession. It's King James continues to play at a very high level. Oh, David tries to stuff it. Good night. And then Sibar is getting a call for the goal. Wow, great entry pass. And then a better rejection from Anthony Davis. Here's Fox twirling and puffing it in high off the window. Hashemura, he got it. Rui Hashemura with 15. Three to shoot towards A. King Cahass. How did Rui Sibar was right down a bit? Fist bump. Oh, it's Hashemura, Shuffle's it in. Dindwitty. Into the paint. Find Davis. Davis lays it in plus the foul. Dwarves. Again. Here's Hashemura, a great possession. Reaves. Each team with 15 assists. Here's Rui, working behind Davis. Rui steps back. Three. He is good. Rostin Rui is feeling it. So is King Murray. Fox dashes into the paint and finishes. As James turns it over to the begin of third. He gets Murray, he will slam it in. Farms. He got it. Rorgis lead a night for Sacramento. It is now nine. Fox. Smooth. Ellis. Will let it fly. You bet. Okay, Lensair. But this is the beauty of you. As Davis lays it in back to back. Productive trips. It's a horrible dozen at a time. It was a really tough one. It made it run. It's not worth it. Make it up. Come on. This is limited in the first half with three foul. Farms. Spass. James will fire. And hit for three. Murray wide open. Pony. I love the push. Here's Rui's. And Davis in range. Junker is good. Zero points. There's some voters twisting his way inside. And David is some man. The Davis is well. Now the draker is turning over again. Monk. Sores in pursuit. Very sloppy third quarter. For the Lakers. Fox. True. James. James kicks into the corner. Prince. Max Adem. Deon Ellis starting tonight in place of Kevin Herder. Fox. Oh, so smooth. The Angela Russell, old for seven from the floor in this game, gets that one to drop. And when he sees one go through, we know he can heat up in a hurry. LeBlanc with the sides of the pitch. Fox veering behind the back. Go! David. All the sauce. Here's James. Oh, David, James. Didn't have lift up. Here's James again to the rack. But still, Paul Slam. For King James. Three, he is good. Barnes left alone. Barnes short. Marie off to the flesh and from Savonis. Moe. True. Not a deep three. And then a stare at Austin Leeds. From a Leeds Moe. James pocket pass. Davis. Cap. They have struggled defensively since the all-star break. Mitchell. Mitchell is beautifully off the window. James underneath. Russell quick touch. Monk push-up. Back iron. No. So bonus another rebound. 17. Barnes. You bet. Not Jamerian, the corner. The bonus 9-0 against AD earlier as we mentioned in the broad test. Right now he's 5-8 from the field. As Harrison Barnes it's another three. He's brought a level of such a great point towards the physicality and intent. The entire night is James. He's got to poke in the eye. As he finish that, the chance for three is as far as is the building in his difficult shots just incredible. Reaves in the corner. Able to knock it down. Monk. The bonus. Fires the down. Barnes will take 10. Wow. What a night for Harrison Barnes. He's 7-3. Davis in the corner. Knocks down the three. Russell the steel. Reaves lays it in. In the left here. No faint heartbeat. Still going. Fox. His three. Very good. Christine shakes to the ramp and throws you down. It does. It is season where you talk about it. It proves you've been up and down. They've beaten the top teams that lost to the others. It's a big time when on a restless advantage night. Against a team that needed it there. For just the second time in franchise history. The Kings have swept the scene.
