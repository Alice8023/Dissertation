 You ready? You game? I'm game. Players are crutchy. If you toss it up, working with Rayakosta and Dada Kamoja. And here we go from Atlanta. Jazz in black, Hawks in white. Just about two minutes in and no scoring. Another turnover. This one committed by Sexton. DJ leaves it, broken up, capella, finds it and dunks it. Put a lot of pressure on them. They will turn the ball over as they start to do already. And the second thing, Hawks got a press appeal. Have to limit them to one side. You can pass to John and Conwyn Sexton. Cost it up. Man, there you are. Foggy. Leaves it for DJ. Nine, nothing time out, Will Hardy. And a Utah uniform. Sexton. Moves in. Uses glass to score. Utah's first basket at the 705 mark. After starting in Cleveland. Here's Murray. Who's ball to commoners? Hendrix goes up and in. That's an after a wonderful, rookie season. Back for year two. I'm about sparks and lobs. Kessler lays it down. Walker Kessler. There's a lot of these duck for gas players. It's been a lot of time under twins to religion. Here's a lot by Hendrix. It's good. Here's Jalen Johnson. Hands it over to Hunter. Bruno. Got it off and put it in. Stick back for Bruno, Fernando. Jordan Clarkson. Five and one against the Hawks inside State Farmerina. Bogey. Up and off. Bruno. Another stick back. Left hand jam this time. Sense of loss three. Bulls Utah within five. Hunter. Water is good. And a foul on Utah. Winstner, very complimentary. As marketing gets the lot. Winstner, very complimentary of Cody Bufkin in the Breakein. Here we go, second quarter from Atlanta. Well, Atlanta's starting to pick the offense and Bogey gets a good look at it there. Hunter, a foul, the loose ball and laid it in. 28-20 Atlanta. Bogey. Got a good look. Clarkson. Dives to the hole and lays it in. We appreciate Holly Row coming by. How about Lynette Water? Nobody's talking about her. She's got the all-time women's record. It just won in the NCAA. Gotta give a little love for Lynette. One of the all-time greats. 36-27 Atlanta. Clarkson. God, missing, but Lowry marketing. Right there. That's that size by Utah. Rebound Bogey. Atlanta by eight. Three tenths. Atlanta by eight. Three tenths to go. Second half. A second quarter by the way. Here's Bogey. Back it up and fire it again. Hit it. Now Lowry marketing going in. That's a little tall, another opportunity. Stay on the opposite glass. Walker fighting under for position. Cross court to the weak side corner. Sex to go it up. An acrobatic shot goes. 41 Atlanta. Jalen. Good looking three. Straight from the top. His second. The runner. No, that's gonna be a pass to Kessler. Clark. Got it back and put it in. Eight points for Walker Kessler. DJ. Jalen. Three seconds. It's gonna be Bogey for three. It open. And the first half horn sounds. Thank you all Atlanta ball to begin. This second half, that over the top. It's a purrey. Try to get him going. And that helps. Well you know coach said one thing very very good. The hawks are playing deep things now. They able to get out in one as you see the easy bucket. That's a deep bay gets into basket. John Collins gets his first bucket in his return and a foul on Clint. Sex to head a wide open three. And Mark takes it off and looking for them. They get it back. The out day George drills one. I see you to the right. The out day George went back to back three. Picked off by sexton. Sexton is everywhere. Pulls the three and connects. Time out Atlanta. We will ever forget that poster dunk on Joe Lombona beat the playoffs. That was a thing of youth. Hoss out of the time out jazz on a 12-3 run. But Bogey hits the hawks back on track with the three ball his second of the night. At least trying to get that foot back. Here comes George firing and hitting. Look at the wild again warmed up Nick but here he comes. I could pass to Capella. Boy nice dime for Murray. Right low. But he remains a town. Murray. Left hand. What you're playing right into the hands of the net. 72-62. Harrison Matthews. Right in the bucket. 13 point advantage. Murray spinning. Create space. Follows hits. Well DJ just wasn't going to beat the ninth. Matthews. Stumbling. No it's going to be taken down by Kessler. And I thought he got hit. Chris Dunn. Markin. Well he just don't have it tonight so far. Bogey on a bitch. That got out of Jalen. His movie The Water is Good. 83-67. Jalen cuts across to Steele. 4-3 Atlanta. Atlanta Metal Hunter lays it in. 4-4 season. With the Jalen. Bogey. Cutting Bucke. Little photo. Is good. The boy that gets a hole in the left hand. Markin and corner three. No. Left foot and rebound for Jalen. Jalen Johnson this pile in up the boys. Goat scene. Bruno. He's done it every night. Here's Bogey. Side line. Hunter. That's the three. Wow. What a shot. And again Bobby, he's taking five shots in this game. Sense a ball from the corner. He connects. He's lost three for the season basically. And you got to find a way, particularly sitting 10th on that plan. Reverse. Per Kessler. 17 points for Bogey. Donovan bitches. Third three. And that's what happened when you don't help off the screen and roll. And an outback in for Sektan. Kessler sitting back in the lane. Well, we tried to beat it to Bruno, broken up. Sektan leads a four on two. Law to comments. And cheers for Jason. 825 to play for the quarter. Garrison Matthews. Just a little more. Just a little more. Over the odd stretch, bigger tips of Capella, no basket. It's Clint the other way. Give it aucidic hillfire. Short rebound Murray. Back to Clint Landon. Kessler steps through. Clint denies. Over to Murray. Hawks on the push. DJ with a little daylight. And the George Gervinesk figure roll. Got to get that one to go on the fly. Gaz the other way. They play it Orlando next. Sektan from the corner. Colin with 22. 1390 with 435 left. Gordon Tucker runs over. Pluck get on a blocking foul. Count the basket. Yeah, I'm going Hunter. Nice pass found. Clint the fellow, but Kessler broke that play up. Gordon Tucker leads a big fellow from Noon and with the dunk. Gordon Tucker, very under control. When he went to the basket. You tell it's just going to dribble out the clock. The Hawks will hold the opponent under 100 and win it. Going away. Back to back wins. Thanks for watching. I hope you enjoyed this video.
