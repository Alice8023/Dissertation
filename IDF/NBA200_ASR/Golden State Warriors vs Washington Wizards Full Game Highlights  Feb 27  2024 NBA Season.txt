 You ready? You game? I'm game. And how you deal with Kuzma is going to say a lot because he is their scoring engine that opens the scoring. A lot of the Kamehya executed perfectly. So it's a back screen from step. Kisper to deep three that he rails. They got some shooters. Kisper's one of them. Tyres Jones can knock him down. Kuzma's got the greenest of green lights and he could score in a variety of ways. Kamehya banking at home. Bagley had come over and the train from Detroit. He drops into three. Again. Kamehya trying multiple defenders and train on hitting the three like he always does in the first quarter. Shot clock at five. Kuzma again. Come on. Kuzma three and four. Slow him down now. Kamehya is getting all he wants right now. J.K. looks good. The damps key and open three. Any guy? Good matchup. He said Jordan will be looking for his offense and he opens with the three. He's been playing well lately. GP2 went to hammer it down but missed the dunk. Bagley got over there to bother that one. And Poole's got an easy layup. He had a couple defensive breakdowns here. Reload play tops in three. GP2. He didn't miss that dunk. Kisper attacking. They're able to finish. He's not just a shooter. He put it on the floor a little bit. GP2 having that block. Gary stays with it. Looney had the good hands initially but couldn't quite hold on. And the Wizards are defending. They're trying to move the ball and shammy knocks down a three. They're shooting. Amazingly right now. Play tops in. Speak to coming off the bench at 23. And that first half against Denver. Back out to Clay. So J.K. They put him in the post. He got Dremont at three. He got Clay at three. Kisper said to Pajewski. Oh man. Chris Paul. That up. Paul crushing screen right there. Shot clock at seven. Anybody that they're bringing it off the bench is paying dividends right now. Shammy missing there. Butler the offense. A rebound. Pull on his feet. Sadden. Jordan Poole hitting the three. Sharich and open three. Clay creating that. Place creating a line. Already since he's been in. It's not just his scoring. Clay with his feet set. See that's when you watch him. If it's in the pocket as feeder set his three looks the same as it's always the. Chris Paul back out to Moody. An open three and he got it. Now they're regulating. Clay did not force a shot there. Shot clock at five. And Chris Paul hits a three. That's where Clay Thompson is just getting better and better. Shammy has had the hot hand. And he buries another one. He's got a deep two. Tough little fade like a trace Jackson Davis sneak in. Jarrett Butler good fine for Bagley. And he's able to duck at home. Washington shooting 52%. Moody pulls it back and hits a three. And as the warrior bench going nuts. Chris Paul to trace Jackson Davis. And you knew you'd be seeing that. And GP to give me that. Running with Pajewski got around ties Jones to lay it up and add. And again stops. That's how you get out of the transition. Steph the school. Pajewski and Traymon. That's two of the smartest players you're going to see working together perfectly. Kaminga. He has been setting up guys of the three point line. It's his third assist on a main three. In and out of the hands of kiss for Pajewski. Keeping alive. Running with Kaminga to dunk it down. Pretty as flier the night. Hey, Guzma. Eight to three. Nice Jones flipping it in and drawing the foul. Get it at one point game. Kaminga soaring in to lay that in. He's got a dozen staff with a nice pass. See that adjustment. You got to get back though. That's a fade left. So fast they want to play. Kiss for Brandon right back. Chris Paul. I have to start missed 21 games and come back and play this well. Who's the switch down to Steph? And that's good offense by Washington. You might think about double teaming in four and second half. That one blocked. And Moses booty hustling back. And saving it. Push ahead. Curry. The lob to Kaminga. How about that? How good is Moses booty been? And Steph Curry. His first field goal. Shot clock at seven. Now booty the three. And he got it. How good is he been in his starting role here? Shammett from the foul line. And he rims it home. And Henry Shammett's got 10. It's Kiss for the Rocks of three. Think about the NBA. Everybody is capable. Steph threw that on and how to bounce to pay now. Sweet was that. They did well to grab it. Come down instead of trying to finish in the air. He gets ZP2. Give me that. And then he'll lay it in on the other end. Steph thought he was pushed in the back. No whistle. And Ty has Jones. Running it to Kuzma. Washington into that. Here we go again mode. And Clay Thompson hits a three. Continuing his workout to this. This fall they leave him alone. And he parapsed three. Shot clock at five. Clay Thompson three is perfect. So Clay's got 14 with four made threes. Clay rocks into another three. Thank you. He's got 18 on five of seven shooting from three point left. Butler dropping it off nicely. Oh, but Jeff's keep with the block. Tuck it from his shot holes. Clay Thompson three. He's on fire. This has been confirmed. He's been taking it right back. Kuzma kind of directing traffic here with the 21 point lead. Now, Kaminga. Kuzma just orchestrated that perfectly. You got a score. Keep scoring. Andrew Shaman, like I'm going to stay with Clay Thompson. But when he gets in this mode, forget about it. He's got 23. Kispert. Say the way he drives. And then the way that three point shot is part of his arsenal. Just a quality player. Cutting ties. Jelsa floated up and in. And in. And in. Back in the game. Steve Kerr is going to take a time out. Jordan driving to flip it up and in. Just quickness. He's made off the drill. Flip her step. Clay Thompson is the only one saving the day in the fourth quarter right now. Sharer's running the floor. Darryl lay it up and in. What a fine for Graemont Green. And back lead. Henry now on the Kispert delivery. Long way to go in this game. Watching in as out of these distinct edge in the fourth quarter. GP2 with an iPhone. Kispert. You got a ball game now. Steve Kerr's got to use another time out. And step little floater inside. So Kerr he's got 10. Tyres Jones. He could start for a lot of team. Steph had two people leave their feet to get in with the left hand. And out the Tyres Jones. Another rebound. Lou Stremon's got it. Push ahead. Kaminga soaring in. Just like it. And you can think GP2 because he won the Tyres Jones. We'll have that blocked GP2. Who else? Locked up three. And then Steph hitting the three. So Steph wants to get things right over next game. Who's my nice delivery to Bagley? He will be fouled and flipped it in. My bag has been productive tonight. And Shammin at Open 3. Who's my attacking? Who's my wow? That's a tough take and finish with the left hand. Right top son back in, setting up JK. Beautifully done. He's got a lot of time in the air this game. Bagley. Mr. Curry rattling that out. Pgepsky. Steph with a warm up three. And he got it. Thank you Pgepsky. You've been stepping on the chance at it. How cosmo. It's got 25 tonight. It's a Leicester Canyon as. Longwood Moses Moody, Trace Jackson Davis, Jerome Robinson. And Mario Sharich. And turnovers were a problem tonight. It is Jordan Poole with steel and finish. Sharich Devil. Shot cock at two. Moody will shoot that three and rattle it home. So Moses with four made threes tonight. I use 40 as the barometer as who's the scores. They're 18 and four now when they make 40% on threes. Win number 30. Thank you.
