In the Eastern Conference, five games back of the play-in. Atlanta currently there. 10. Here's Scottie Bay attacking. In the Eastern Conference, five games back of the play-in. Atlanta currently there. 10. Here's Scottie Bay attacking. And he lays it up. And through. How about that? Get your block and engol the other way for a bucket. It's because of the effort level. It wasn't there. And they lost by 50 heading into the break. They were literally already on the break, yes. Bridges lays it up and through. As I mentioned, this is an opportunity to grab their first Atlantic division, W. Bridges of Gary Trent Jr. 42%. Ben Simmons loses it. RJ Barrett in the corner. She won the scene. One another. Great pass by RJ Barrett. You know, it's both sides doing everything possible to help to create a good promotion of the game and make it better. And the Scottie Green Lentless on the glass lays it up and in. It's a nine-oh-run. Upfake and it close out for Schroeder sends it back over to Trent Jr. turns the corner. And dribbles it back out. He's going to fire away and he's feeling it. Shooting it well. They have shot under 30% from three in three games leading into the break. They're running hook by Walker's good. Into the front court. Brown, get cornered. Gray. It's gone. But what a difference. What happened at some? The head coach in basketball. The fell of Minko's for overtime elite. It was Walker. The three is good, which Abaji is guarding. Can Thomas. Thomas was a three and it's good. Kevin Oli, a practice and then you get a going in. Sheed around. Here's Scottie. What a post up. What a win. It's score quickly. You did that much better. Return over is here in the second quarter. And they're leading to points in the timeout. Take it by Darko. Yeah. You got the jerk chicken too. You got the jerk chicken too. I'm done. Okay. That bucket is good. Here's Thomas. Bridget's fading. Gray. Here's Schroeder. We got that coming in the fourth. Here's Thomas. The Schroeder. In the three is good. I love the nets analysis. They always give my mother a shout out. Here's Bridget with the three and at the three point game. And the timeout. Take it by Darko. Jack. I actually didn't select them. I produced a game. That's what I was building. It makes you sound like I know what I'm doing. Our team paired the three. Come on. Not only can he drop things. He can knock down Jimmy. It's still no. He's going. Quickly. Inside. Bucket is good. Here's Bridget's short. Scotty. Repound his eight. Right in the arm with the throwdown. Stocker city rising up. Quickly. Attacking in the paint of the window. Hey, that cues got 10. Oh, no plates tonight. So long trip tonight. Rattles that play. Denial. I'm the random. Skate. Starts with the block. Thomas. There's a love Adrian Griffith. Right. So when you think of that, it's been the whole season. Did a great job that time getting out and transition. Unfortunately, Gary Trent Jr. Missed that shot in the three years good for Bridges. Man get up. Did he call the foul on the play? Yeah, and he made the late call. He made the last call. He made the last call. He made the last call. He made the last call. Yeah, and he made the late call but the right call. He's a whistle in the foul and continuation. Dribbles it back out. Thomas is attacking. And the reverse is good. I'll leave one in title. And 2014 with the new gun Huskies. I know you're hot but that's a little bit cold. Kill. King's in the right to the iron. It's been a very interesting journey. I've been trying to have a lot of fun. Get better and find new ways. I've been talking to coaches. Great. I'm trying to protect and do exactly that. Shoot more. I'll have to back in the iron. Quickly. Right to the iron. It doesn't go. Grady Dick cleans it up. 618 to go. I want to take a look at that. I'll get up and we'll get bridges. Lays it up and in. That answer. G. Lee Scotty. All the way. Scotty stays with it. Banks it up and in. His 22nd double double. Problem is going. The dollar is around 62 cents. There's no doubt that it could be a buy-as-one. Speaking of the West Coast, what about that young man? He's the world. Short keeper. Short keeper. Short keeper. The inside sharp with a bucket. Shot clock down to seven. Quick move. Shot clock at five. Step back. Quick move. Quick move. How about that? Smith. Banks it in. Kelly to Abagi. Abagi. Back over to Trent Jr. Step back. Top of the circle jumper. The sweet shot. It works. And then the scale of Kelly and Linda. Grady. I love that. The old trick. You act like you're running back. Barnes. Garden by Clack. Sing Gary with an upfig. Ten of the shot clock gets room. Clires over Simmons. This has gotten all to a good start. Nice rhythm. Starting backward. It can buy 40 points, Jack. There's Ham Thomas with a bucket. Kenny Atkinson did a great job. They were competitive. And then... I'm touching that tonight. Yeah. Abagi lays it up and in. They've taken a few different directions. Right. The rebuild. And then when Durant showed up, they had to adjust in maneuver quickly. 58 games as a second year in the lead. Here's RJ Debris. RJ Barrett, Kennex. Two people. Come on, man. He's trending to the positive ways. But really well down the stretch for the rest. Great dish. And Clackson with the slam dunk. It's going to be interesting for Ben Simmons after... We have an outlaw nice like this where it's kind of like the rappers about breathing room all night. You know, great focus. Remember, 61-60, they responded. Here is like it. Double. 5-30 to go. Here's quickly the play. And Raptors M8-143 is jacked up. I get sent to the locker room early. The choice works, but hey, it doesn't make me a big guy. Here's DJ Cartoon with the left. 10-day contract, $1 and a dream, right? Yeah. Room-blowing $1. Turn over. And then Brooklyn gets a bang and the bank shot is good. Started that Ohio City. And then Brooklyn gets a bang and the bank shot is good. Started that Ohio City. And then transferred to market. And make your decisions in New York City is based upon where you want to go. On the inside, Walker gets it back. Side step. Three. Doesn't go. Who say with a rebound, that's going to do it. Raptors take it. And then the next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one.
