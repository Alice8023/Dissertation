 They catch the ball with their own The Rockets are straight. First, rebound hard, who's about as good of a rebounder as a card is coming to lead. He's been chenzo quick-releasing knock down the three. There you go. Good find, the help by Sins, turn back Thompson, and it Brooks up top, Kansas. One of the best three-man combos in basketball over the last six weeks has been Randall and Anobyan a big time dunk there, rumbling to the rim. The next play at a decent pace, they don't necessarily score a lot though. The transition and they're getting to the cup. They're making their freeze courtesy of defense. Chenzo and a lot of rim runs and dunks already for New York. Rockets could get the lead back here on this trip. I have no idea how that went in. I didn't think about it. Like if I had to pick four guys from the league now that I would love to see the dunk contest, Chenzoon. One free throw coming up, and then Chenzoon flip the detainee blue the layup. Rockets have to capitalize on those opportunities. God of it, Staddle count. One free throw coming up for him. Miles but dried on the other side. Here's a young man in his third year out of West Virginia, who meant what a difference. This season has meant for him 41% from three at a career eye. Providing that Nick was called. He minutes off their bench. Holiday with a left hand. Listen, since that dunk from Holiday, man, terrific additions to the Nick's. He's had more shooting. Had more scoring. Holiday runner. No, how about the rebound? Smith tapped it to himself to put it into the hole. And doing games as well on the side for right university. Dylan Brooks, no third effort. Yes. Rockets best offense right there. Just hit the boards and yeah, good stuff there. And look, obviously the Rockets got out to a terrific start. Deals to say they're not playing as well here at the plate, but ultimately with all the young talent on this team. If you've rewarded Jabari for playing defense and you saw him celebrate the layup from Jabari, love that from Jalen Gray, man. You know what? I can't do math. It's hard. They're up for payers. Bring into the paint right to the rim. We're going to use his speed to get around even chinso. And he implements it right away and he gets it. She's going to get the ball cut. Where's the ball going to be? Get it still. Rockets. Where's the log to jam? I have some more room at some point. I'll, I might tell that story. It's the French head. Oh, tough shot on the other side. You get a smaller Brunson on me. I could shoot right over him. Very few gym to chase left anymore, an ageually baseball. Brunson, talked about that floater game in the open. There's one right there. He's trying to be as a hufflepuff kind of guy, Ryan, but I don't know. So you a snake? Is that what you're saying? Hey, you know. They can Brunson. For terrain. Yes. And that time, Shane Goon dribbled into a triple team and turned the ball over. Rare turnover for the Rockets without a good one, Brunson. The heart. So again, you fear in this game getting back in transition. That's going to count plus a foul on a chewing. Little Vanessa, that's the match that we want to see here. Unfortunately, Fred is out. Yep, absolutely. Sims with the dunk staying with the the Finchinzo off the screen runner. Good. Second best offense of rebound. I see him in the league and you've seen it here over the last couple of minutes. Jalen Grease flipped it in. And the foul. Lening to a four point lead. The Finchinzo to heart. And he knocks it down. The basketball there, Rockets can get to go. But Brunson won off to in and won. Game is three on two, used in a man that just dribbled the ball literally in the heart. Jalen raised the other way goes to Brunson. He works baseline, awkward, and the bank did it. And the Finchinzo. Oh, hey! Another major league. Yeah. And how about a men topson? Yeah. He over the offensive glass. Ten rebounds now for him. By the way, his five steals a career. I, Brunson spinning, shooting, scoring. Fourteen now to side. They poked away. Look at a man. And they did to Smith. Three on one. Back to Smith for the game. Why not? They were following again. My goodness. Sixteen now for the game. Prime MJ is a win always. But as far as dunking Finchinzo's a better dunker than MJ, please take that from right away. Let's get Aaron Holiday into the dunk contest. Brooks for three. His third. Brooks normally hurts the rocket. He's been quiet. Oh, he's a five surprise in his cell. Hasn't scored. There's Bond out of it. Now with eight got off to a hot start. His first point. Since. Brooks again, this time for the corner up. And some words to the mid-spinches. Well, as he hits the other one. See the difference in the switches for the rockets now. Hey, touch. Oh, that was a tough shot. It doesn't now for him. But you has got four. Sims who's not out there also has four. Remember, Martian Stein is not playing. Neither is Randall nor Anomaly. And Bostodovic. Here's the difference. I like that from the rockets. You see that cutter that takes away the help and gotta be ready now. Good. Fine. Count it. Plus the file. The coaches that I've said, hey, you don't forget the three point. Go hit the class. Go get on the boards. And he's excelled from the elbow. Brunson knocks it down. He's got 23. I can shit going. Working on heart. There's the double. There's the triple. The Brooks has to. The three got it. See two as nine to the quarter. Twenty for the game. Rockets have five guys in double figures. There goes. Hearts. Oh. Just do the special. Man. Brooks is open. Quarter three. Quarter three. Number six. He made six triples tonight. By God of it. The swing. Heart. The drive. Back across the books over green. Got it. His first make up the game. The other Brooks three pointers. Making them stay home. Brunson will drive. And he gets it to go. Twenty five for him. Brunson on Brooks. Stepping back. Contested. Two times the game. At one. Working on a two up. Go baseline. Comes on the other side. Had it blocked. Holly picked it up. Good. Torch the rim. And it. Oh. Look out. Hold up. Oh. They called a foul on Brunson. How fitting. All the day was called for a foul. Was pulled back. It's an in regulation. There's a foul call as Holly. He did. Carfowl is under review to see if the illogical contact occurs prior to the game. Fuck. Spire. Replay review the illegal contact occurs with point three on the game. Three free throws three tenths of the second on the game. Derek Fisher headed with point four right. Oh. Yes. You miss on purpose in the lab would be live. But they got the first throws it up. Made them both. They're in harmony. They made. Yep. That's it. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. They're going to give a time out to New York. I mean, good. After replay review three tenths goes off the game. Plot of the time out. Therefore, the game is over. Oh, it's over. The game is over. Why not? Wow, it didn't look like there was some time left. They say, nope, no time left. Rockets win.
