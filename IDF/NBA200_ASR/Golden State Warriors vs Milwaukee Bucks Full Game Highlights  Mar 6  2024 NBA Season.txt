 You ready? You game? I'm game. My bad moves at time. Smash up for the second time this season. As Lillard gets free, finds it to the Cuppo drives inside. And the first bucket for Yannis. A little guard of my curry. Drives inside, throws it up, shot long goal with it to the Cuppo right there for the foul. Oh, Jonathan Kaminga. He's been living in the paint during this wonderful stretch drives inside again. Lap is good. They're giving Yannis the three-pointer and he knocks down one down. Viginski gets away from Lillard. throws it up, Doc Wiggins says a good look. Knocks down the three. Viginski. Thanks again from straight on says okay. Lillard harassed by two defenders. Viginski pushes him. One man to beat throws it back for Kaminga. Boy, this rookie scouts him real flair. I should have stayed. This is the entertainment. Green drives, Lap gets the roll. Again, Warriors happy to be home. They have not placed in Sunday. Viginski gets inside. Lillard gets inside. Beautiful shot off the glass from Lillard. Drain on green inside. Curry, that's Curry's first shot. Beautiful pass from Green. Doc Wiggins is talking about Beazy's for more effort defensively as Curry. From downtown, knocks down one to shot clock at eight. Lillard contests to three. I'm in Lillard. Now with six points. We're watching two of the best shot makers in the history of the NBA. The degree of difficulty is unbelievable. Curry, way outside. Another three. He's four for four. Oh boy. He has fun playing basketball. Nice pass. Paul, the Peyton and for a couple of sloppy turnovers after that time. Time out from each team. Lillard gets inside. Lap panicked. Chris Ball throws it ahead. Looney running the floor. Four transition defense that time from Milwaukee. It should let them play a little bit. Play Thompson. That's going to be Thompson with his first shot of the night. As Porter gets inside. Porter's nice scoop shot from Bobby. Porter's. Yeah, we try shouldn't compare to that. I think that's tough. One in. They're one point shy of their halftime Celtic score. Chris Ball, three punters good. Paul been shooting so well from three. Lillard. Porter's his three pointer. That's going to Bobby. Paul is. He's four for four and has 11 points already. This coming a knocks down a three and it's an 11 point lead. Nice feed inside Jackson Davis. Well, you sometimes you forget when he doesn't play for a while just how Chris Ball is. Camingo open three. Got it. Jonathan Camingo with 12 points. Camingo backs in. He's having a heck of a first half here. Comed to nice feed inside. And Porter's able to connect. Kind of to lines it up and nails the three that's there for a three pointer. If you're watching this book team heard of this first call, knocks down another one. They're trying to play good defense. But right now, go on the stage not missing anything. Nor is Bobby Pardis. Drainman Green, we asked him about it before the game. And he said everybody would run through a wall for you. People wanted to work for you. But a wonderful legacy that you left here. We want to apologize to Bucks fans because I'm sure they just want to hear about their team right now. Is that Tachyplow with a beautiful move. He's got 12 points. Connerton from three. He's got six points. He said both of his shots. Wiggins looking to post up Lillard kicks it out. Peyton checks the seams and hits another three. Lillard finds Beasley. Beasley is trying to get on track. Lopez wide open. Yeah, Brooke Lopez with his first field goal, first points for Lopez. That's a two-pointer for Flink Thompson. Curry throws it ahead. Finds Caminga, tracks it down. There's Thompson. And throws it in. Thompson inside the Peyton Quick Release. For the ball moment is superb. That's the 21st assist for the Warriors here on the first half. Or shot blocked by Green. Caminga comes up with it. Warriors on the run. Drain on Green. Back for Caminga. Our dominant stretch here for Goldberg. State on a 20-pointer. Lillard stepped back three-pointer rattles that one in and boarded. Bucks need that with a minute to play here in a second. Curry inside using that left pan. Shilling with defender. Curry finds some room. Bucks the space and hits a three. That's his third three-pointer. Yaw has to full speed and dropped it off to J. Prouder. Prouder causes you to help. That's a two-pointer missing and Lopez having a block. Caminga got in there. Caminga caught it. Yaw has made him miss. And the guy in the block is shot. Staff for fly by three and he's got 20. That is a big sequence there. Don't want to leave Lillard as he hits that three-pointer. Yaw has to full speed. Lillard got step on a switch. Step back three. Perfect. He's failed it. The trip becomes really important. Staff for the warm-up three. The warm-up deep two. Curry's being dribbled away and having a block that abounds by Beasley. Yaw has to spin move. The finish in the five. Trying to throw a curga-fender. Lopez scoring inside. This great defense from the box. And Davis gets inside. Welcome tested. Run an adjustment and another impressive rookie for the Warriors trying to get more minutes. What a block. From Jackson Davis and another one. Back to back rejections for the rookie. Curry. Dancing goes inside. Throws it up. And Jackson Davis completes it. There's a little rookie rampage. Alleyo. A perfect pass. Lillard to a tentacle ball. The couple to cross over. It goes right into Caminga. He did it again. Jackson Davis is third. Rejection of Yaw and a finish. Caminga. Four, about a three. Valon jumps shot. That's maturity right there. Bobby Portis. Pretty good shooter himself. My gun leave. He made a great draft fix with Trace. But he was amazing defensively and he got some buckets down there too. I told you before the game that if he cried, I would let you know during his tribute. He did cry. He didn't cry. Doesn't surprise me. So Lillard goes inside. Shot clock by Green. Another way they took a point away. Green. Another beautiful pass. Chris Paul has nine assists. Little shot. Caminga got a piece of it. He did. He did. He did. Nice beat inside. Yeah, and the word is a respondent. They've responded in a big way. Which helps me from downtown. Steve. Beasley gets a run. Start the floaters up and good. Just a second field goal for Beasley. How about the two rookies? One's going into the coop or the other going to Lillard. And as a set of coop. And it knocks down the jumper. That's great defense by Chris Jackson. David. No hesitation from the left hander. Jackson Davis. Right on two throws it down. Moody up top. Graeme on green. Place the green. Knocks it down. Warriors back in complete control. Green's going to try again. Stack to back. Green's retained on green. Totally different story here against the box. Lillard with the answer. And Damien Lillard now with 20 points. Scurry. Knocks down the green. Step back. Water performance. But he's going to stay. Warriors. Curry. Now with 29. Vogue champs come on for the bucks. Not on our eyes. Moses Moody. Kinex. Jarge gets it out. Moody fakes. Moody drives. And Moody finishes. Warriors had a 20 point lead. And that's how he's doing. And now he's going to do it. He's going to do it. He's going to do it. He's going to do it. He's going to do it. He's going to do it. He's going to do it. Warriors had a 20 point lead. Vogue champ gets in. Blocked again. Jackson Davis. That's his fourth. It's going to be fascinating, like, to see. The year is the oldest three-up. Yeah, Minnesota is... I'm stored a defense. And there's the guy we've been talking about. Jackson Davis, the whole final score. Warriors 125. The year is the oldest three-up. The year is the oldest three-up. The year is the oldest three-up. The year is the oldest three-up.
