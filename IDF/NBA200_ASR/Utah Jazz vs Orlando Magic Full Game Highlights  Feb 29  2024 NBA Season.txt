 the last week. All right, we're underway from Orlando, the magic and the Utah chance. I'll okay. Carole back in the lineup for the magic. Gary Carras for three. He is on the fucking set. The matchup against Jason Sucks. He's got it for three. The second has been played. He's over 20 again, David. Shoot him. 40% from behind the art. I can't guess all the way to the basket. The rookie from Baylor, he's up against Chalant Sucks. After the art. Now we market in for three. He's very good at taking the opportunity now to run the show as the starting point guard. Carole. Second chance, Palo. That's exactly what Sucks. Good pressure on Dea, George. Where's the master, Palo? I shot Palo's back down to three. And there's pushing it quickly up the floor. That carol. It's going to be nice. Parker with the dog. Just seeing what's in the ball. That's what the way by done. Yeah, thanks, George. Watch the glance in here. And easy. Two points off one there. Man, he's rushing into the ball. Two strong. Two quick. The Palo hits the lead guard of the future for this franchise. That's got to catch up. That's the line. One game tight and Twenty-one ì‹¸ up atari with and the Spiderman. Anthony now won on one against a very good defender. Chris done. In goes for three. The all-time leader in three-point field goals made by the same great pop. Back to that three-point area. Magic come away with a steal. False. Lobster. But it brings it down low. And they're one of the top teams and forcing turnovers and turning those into points. Done. No good. Rebound call. Chris down to one on one. Cross court. Three-point shot. Good by Taylor Hendrix. And the man you won in 10,000. That I said that you thought you were in trouble with this way. It's a huge swing. Taking up the odds. Oh, that's by call. Very nice. That guy is a good man. Is it? To the elder. Bobby. Young. Frons. I got a sense of. John Collins bustles one in. Lee's 11. That matches the biggest. Collins parries another three. Seven second chance points. Wagner. Still house left handed slam. Marked himself the screen. Marked it. Let's have blind. Got it for three. And the wall ball really. For five defensive team in the NBA. Anthony. The boxer thriving. Got his shoulders around the Hendrix and throws it down. Anthony. Playing well. How does it define here? You'll go to the right hand. It's done. It's a Wagner duck fence. And it runs. Broke just down. Get it. The back of the fire. No, it's not. Mo. Mo. Alan sex. Jordan. Clarkson. For free. For the long ball. He is keeping. In the second. Alan. He's down. So good. You talk. Yeah. I'm. So good. You talk. You talk. Get the stop. And here they come. John. John. The lead is down to five. Wings in the corner to band. Sarah. He'll drive the baseline. And bouncing into the hands. Jordan. Clarkson. As it turned it over. Jordan. Marked in the line. Open. 4-3. And the Orlando 13 times per day. Holden six in the first half. Here's one. And the second half. Jalen sucks picking the pocket of George. And put it in. Here we go. One ball. One of your old rookies. Loads in the palace. Sex goes for three. And the second. And the second. Which is only a two point lead out of the locker room. So I've been for Carter on target. Here comes sex. Hit him. But that was on target. The Pia Tei. Jordan. Taylor Hendricks now with seven points. Bad Carol. 4-3. That helps. Four. He's not afraid that challenge a guard. Sex goes for daylight. Perry's another three. So bad Carol. Shot clock in five. Jalen sucks left open for three. It's good. Nice. Nice relocation to the reason they are for three. And they are for two. Another three by George. Good again. So might indicate that we need two. No excuses. Play our game. Leave the officials alone. Stop complaining. And go out there and play your game. We can pull away if we play Magic Basketball. Shot clock is in five. And then it's spinning against Chris Duff. Steps into the right corner. Shoot the jumper. That. So let's take the lead again. Jordan Clarkson. That's great defensive play by Foster. And Martin gets the rebound and puts it in. Sex at 15 points in the game. That's a great look at that. That's just Carolis, Sexton. With the steal and the easy two pointer. We talked about er, minus six on the trees. What a finish by Brock. That's it. And Carol times the game at 82. First call for the very, his birthday could be like Stuck's. It could just be a floating birthday. Could be. Ingalls looks through inbound. Yeah, to the band. Carol. Hallows got it. Turn it loose. He does scooping it in. They lead by one. Ingalls. They all find three point. Leader and Utah Jams. History. Carson the other end. Myers of pass to some knowledge for the dog. Pretty good. There were 23 of the games. Clarkson. Dawson. Three. Got it. He's just to the packet down. Get into the lane. Cross-coard passes picked off by Clarkson. Shoot down. And that is done getting in behind the magic defense. Yeah. Carson spinning inside. Nice dish to Markin and Ty's the store in 99. Carson. Yeah, they're drawing. Close the door on here. Three point shots for the corner is good by Henry. Whether you're not a team that keeps Steve's the low field goal for St. and the other one. Minnesota's different rules here. But they just create chaos with their defense. Just starters back off the floor here to close this thing out. Five, there. Sub for three. Two, one. Sub. Sub. Catch it in this corner. Back to Sub. Shoot for three. Good again. He's delivering it right time for the magic. It's the power. Sex with Gartigan. Here comes the double D. Cross-coard. Again. Yes! You're hard to check. Not be happy with that one. They loaded up on Pallow. Real hard to go with his bets down the stretch here. Carson. Stolen by Wagner. Runs two steps ahead of the pass. That's it. Or land those up by. Here is sex down three points. It is no good. Rebound. Take it by. Collins-Hallis-Doxett. Only 23 seconds left. That's going to do it. The magic won out the clock. And they're going to lead day victory against Will Hardy. Thank you.
