 You ready? You game? I'm game. These games often are fascinating. And in the next few, unfortunately, they're playing shornhandlers become a habit without that real point guard. Because Jose Alvarado also outies their back up. And even Chenzone continues his high hand, knocks down a three. Heart was magnificent last night just because he had not just because he had the running puck and his index up. Beautiful pass to Sebs. Now Williamson the rebound. There are good row team, though. 17 and 12. That's Murphy launches a long three pointer. Lines Jones, Valentina Stratapostok. He's one of the strongest guys in the NBA. Valentina Steven Adams in that category. Josh Hart top of the key. The next down one down again is shot starting to come around. Williamson drives on a chew up. There's some help. Kicks it out the corner to Ingram, shot clock at six. Her Jones, Marshall corner three. And that one's good. Four of seven from downtown. He's an important role player for this team. Even Chenzone puts it out five down. I hit off the bounce. Goes inside, couple of fix. Back out to even Chenzone. Tries another three. This one goes. He's already taken six three pointers. And he's hit Jones. Her Jones right back inside. And it's a posting up and kicks it out. Wide open three pointers. Kud. And as Williamson is averaging over five assists from the game setting up her Jones. It's down eight. Nick Bryant, nice cut by a chewer. And the straw finish. Once again, the post up. Hawkins bagged that one in. Bryant struggling with the dribble. Shot clock at six. Josh, hard, chump shot. Got it. Even for shooters like Bogdanovic, just to see one go in the basket sometimes. He talked about that earlier. England gets away. Counted out of foul. Berks to Sims. Hart, Sim gets in the way. Hart's chump shot is good. So one of the back to back juffers. He's got seven. Oh, nice move from Murphy. Got away from Bogdanovic and then Bogdanovic, a bad fight. The Jose Alvarado for Lawrence. Bogdanovic. Next on his third field goal. Williamson pucks away by deep and Genzo. Berks. One man to beat Laepus Curve. Dante, deep and Genzo's defense leads to a layup. Langson drives gets inside. Mystic. Nances fouled and gets them following a goal. A chance for a three point play. And that sometimes can play a part in getting injured. Bob Donovan, no hesitation. Now he's got to go. Under four to play. And then he's got to go. And then he's got to go. And then he's got to go. Under four to play. Langson flips it up. Can't get it. It gets the rebound again. Back up. Banks at home. His second jump is superb. Good job. And making it difficult. And Zelpley from Josh Hart finds by Donovan. Fakes drives back the hard. Beautiful two man game. And then it's back within two. He couldn't grab the rebound. But he could knock it away. Park gets into the pain drives. Lay up right to the goal. And then it's back within two. Mark's got eleven. But Donovan just twelve. Meanwhile, Ingram now has eight. Slytherin. And then having some stretches of offensive struggles. Lay up tied the game. Ingram knocks down the three who's well contested. You're pleased, not satisfied. McBride fakes on a pull. That jump shot. That's something he has worked on so much. The pull up jumper. There's Jones kicks it out in the corner to Murphy. Good recovery there. From McBride. Murphy was going to have a wide open three. But Ingram does it now. Now in tune as husband Brian on McBride. So you got hit. Williams in the offensive rebound. Fal and one. Come down the mistake. Doesn't both well for the playoffs. Jones misses. But right there Murphy out of the foul. Nick's stood and watched it. And Jones ran after. Lads and a crossover gets inside. A man that's sized to have that quickness. It's just unfair for the opponent. Williams knew a lot of the playmaking goes inside. Behind McBride. Great health defense. A chewer goes into the front court. Fines deep in Chenzone. Spots up three pointers good. Even Chenzone's side step floater short. Sims trying to fight it. Comes up with it. Fines a chewer. So touched there. From precious to chewer. Let's get the gift he keeps on giving. Ingram kicks it out. Jones the corner. And a pelicans back up 11. Here on the third quarter. Ingram looking. Jones fakes. Nice feed inside. Valentinus. Good transition defense. Part the little crossover banks at home. Part that's knocked down. He's upset though if they're sure to have foul. Sims goes for the fake. Ingram backs it in. That's just a terrific offensive move. Still time on the shot block. Even Chenzone. That's a three. That's five three pointers. You could rather take threes for the extra point. Higher percentage shooting. Oh, a chewer. Nice roll. It's close to a travel. Robinson. Hardest time. Shot block. By Williamson. McBride tries a three. And Peps. Just a bribe. Big bucket for the Dixies. They try and stay close back within seven. Williamson head down. Drives. Lay up. Counter out of foul. Just too strong. Dangerous pass. Not if it's able to get it though. And then throws up. And it goes in. Not if it's to McBride. McBride at three pointer. That's good. McBride is second three. E-group. Picks it back out. Murphy trying to find some space. By Donovan stays with him. Contest the shot. And Murphy knocks it down. And this now the largest lead of the game. Knicks down 15 with under eight to play. By Donovan comes right back. And he's got 20 points. That's his fourth three pointers. Malle and Chunis could have been locked those guys in the other fell. He is one strong tough dude. What a big target. He'd be a tight end. Even Chunzo connects in on three. From right back. That's his sixth three pointer. Jones with seven on the shot clock. Now he's got McBride on him. Got the height of that. Let's kick it out in the corner. A nice pass. And Murphy hits. Well, it gets wisely taken time off the clock. And he's got a nice shot. And Murphy down the lane. Scoot lay up as good. Murphy's encouraging game to see the way Murphy plays. Bride kicks it in the corner. Even Chunzo. Corner three is good. That's his seventh three pointer. He's got 23 points. But the next still down 13. Both teams missing their point guards tonight. Murphy on a long three pointer. Good spot for them. They were 15 and 26 on a road. This year with them winning this one, we put them up to 18 and 12. Boy, Murphy's having himself a night. Yes, let us in in that family. Just off the charts. Brian kicks it over. Good ball movement here. Another three pointer net. It's answered. Some of these players get some time down low. Nice feed, McBride. The Jericho Sims. Sims got the start tonight. It's like the old rules. I shouldn't do that down the stretch. I think that's kind of silly. When did it become an old rule? Because I'm old and I don't remember that being a rule. When the bench going nuts. That was fun. Well, it's a personal. Let's just basketball. Thank you.
