 three quarters of the NBA season in the books. One quarter remains and both the Dallas Mavericks and Philadelphia 76ers enter a critical stretch as they meet today at American Airlines Center, jockeying for position in their respective conferences. And again, Harris will chase Luke at night pass inside the lively rebound Don Chitch. Nine boards per game for him on the year. There's no long pass. Washington three is good and it's five nothing now. In the corner three three. Nothing start. And now look, you need to look at this and say you use the timeout right now. Look at the step back. Hit it. Eleven nothing Dallas and an early Nick Nurse timeout. And finally, Philly gets a basket buddy heel to as a home here in the Dallas area. In fact, the sixers practice there as a team yesterday's got a full court in his house. Harris with a quick basket as Dallas doesn't get back. Washington's three comes up short. Good save though by Don Chitch to Washington. Floater goes over bomb. Meanwhile, Maxi is not even a tenth of a shot yet for Philly. Took 29 the other night. Great scoop and score against the shop locker. Look at this being Maxi. Floater is good. They've made five of their last six after an over six start. They force a turnover three on two. Healed on the spot up. And it's good. And Philly has the lead. Yeah, they need this guy to get going early. Don Chitch to the corner. Derek Jones able to answer with the three. Jones just 34% on the year up there. Here's another three from the same area. And it's Derek Jones again. Five assists for Don Maxi. Downhill count the basket. They're in four minutes to play in the opening quarter. Dallas by three. Maxi gets past Jones. And again hits that floater. He loves that right side of the floor. At least in the games that you and I do read. Oh, he's the three. Now it looks awkward. But what counts as it went through the net. Maxi, that's a good direction. Goaltending and wetting anyway. But you see the change of pace and the change of direction that's almost impossible to stop. And Maxi created a little space and hits the three on the step back. That is 15 in the quarter for Maxi. Maxi with a hot hand. Another floater. Another basket. 17 in the first. What have you liked about the response you team from your team since? Yeah, well, the last thing I told the team before we went on the floor to start the game is we got to run back. Thank you. Thank you. Don Chitch called the baskets out of the time out. Here comes Green. Green stops. Want by Ubrae, but right there, lively to clean it up. Leads the league and field go percentage. And that's a big reason why. Don Chitch catching fire here with three baskets early on in the second quarter. Unfortunately, when you play him, you have to honor the fact he's six. Irving so good with both hands. The lefty floater goes. Kyrie Irving's first points and Dallas back with it too. Irving's pull up good. Look for you for Kyrie Irving. You have to be careful enough. Your Philadelphia stop and think there now. Read offense, a rebound and put back rolls in. Extra pass. Hanging Irving is great. Yeah, that was very pretty. A Dallas turnover. Harris in transition. And count the basket goal tending by Green. Dallas started the game leading 11-0. Count the basket for Don Chitch. Able to power that one up and in. Finishing through contact. Harris gets the bounce. So he's getting going here in the second quarter. Don Chitch, step back. Fires. It's good. I'm afraid. Don Chitch with 15 now. Harris penetrating. Pretty. Great attack against the shot blocker, Gafford. Harris deep in the lane. Falling away. It's good. 14 now. I like the fact that Harris now is keeping his drill. Axie floater goes again. His first point to the quarter. 19 in the half. Here's Kleba with five. Penetrates. Bravel. A whistle. Don Chitch with two. Thanks an end. Kyrie Irving with the basket. Seven points now for Kyrie. Lauri with four. Gets deep with Joe. He tracks it down and swats it away and then retouched it last. What a great block. One of three for Kyrie Irving. He'll go to work. Harris corner three. And it goes Tobias Harris with 17 now. Harris again. Back to back. Three's fourth Tobias Harris. That pass could not connect though. Got to get it there. Three on one. Washington strip. Don Chitch cleans it up though. Comet and one. Irving has Maxi on his hip. Pulls up and scores. Working around the heeled well defended by Washington. That's why they got him to defend wings on the perimeter. Challenges heeled and makes a tough shot. Tough shot is right. But you like about Lauri there. Lauri didn't tell. That was a good move. How about the three? Harris doubled. Fine teal. Why don't put his Lauri. And finally Kyrie with his first field goal of the game. Don Chitch gets to the rim and has 20 points now. Bomb. Oh, yes. Lauri with a nice fine. Hardaway. Pass Maxi. Finally. Hardaway on the board. Extra pass to Washington. Skip Jones. Jones hands and gets it. And he's in double digits now. 10 points. Ubrae. That's where he is. Oh, wow. Taken it downhill to the hole. They want him to continue to attack the rim rather than settle for perimeter shots. Irving, great hang. And finish. Was a foul. So back to back buckets for Ubrae while attacking the rim. Ubrae finishes. Again in the paint. Did he need a lot of one on one here? But Maxi. Oh, deserving hits of three. Ubrae has the last six points for Philadelphia. Ubrae with a jab step. Gips it up to the two. Good look. That's good. 4-2. There was no reason to double team him. And the clock was down. Ubrae penetrates. And he can get where he wants to. When he wants to do that instead of 70 for three. Here's Jones. Got it. 3-2. 3-2. Max had lost 3-4 as Ubrae gets it. Feel from green in transition. Gits the line. Nice. Shot clock at 7. Harris has 20-18 since the first quarter. I was contested. But Harris drills it anyway. Again, the man's have lost 3-4. One of those losses on a 60-footer by Maxi Struse is Don Chitch nails it from the foul line. Wired of this losing 3-4, Dallas at 1-7 in a row. The longest win streak since Luca joined the team. Nice. Reed with the dunk, but Tum. Good high low. Jones who's been terrific off the bench. He has not missed a shot from the floor. He's been terrific. Both halves. Ubrae on the spot up. That's good. Switches home of three. Spark basketball. Zubre driving. Bomb shot. Goes down over lively. Don Chitch. On the move. Got deep. Binds Jones and Jones. Gray is there. He continues to stay hot from DPS 5 or 5. Don Chitch spin. Step back from mid-range. Around and down. That's one of his pet moves. Luca trying to break down Harris. Driving at the chest of the Tum. So powerful. And he's got 28 now for the game. Don Chitch with pace up the floor. Tries the three from straight away. From him. And then. That's a big one. Maxi fires underneath. But Tum, a little 10 footer is good. Great pass by Ubrae. Luca going to drive. Got high. Great pass Ubrae for the lay of 35 points now for Don Chitch. Irving. Pull up jumper. Got it. Dallas back with in five. Ubrae splits the D. To the corner. Harris catching. You got it. A three. Tobias Harris. Who's had a huge game? Here's Don Chitch. They needed deep one. Front rim no offensive rebound. Washington. The slipback rolls around and drops. Still a six point lead. Lowry with three. Harris blows by his man. Harris puts it in. 28. Some clutch shots by Tobias Harris. The three from Don Chitch from beyond the hash mark. And Dallas back with in five. Maxi followed by green. Maxi gets both free throws. Jason Kidd will call a timeout. That's the last time out for Dallas. And Don Chitch missed the long three. A great rebound. Irving. Bill Hoist and him. Got to be smart. And they don't fall. Maxi. Now they foul but Tum. But they wasted a few more seconds. I get it. You don't want to foul a guy that shoots close to 90%. 20 consecutive free throws after that one falls for the two. 40 bench points for the sixers. Here on the road. Irving's three is good. So. Can Dallas get a steal? In the Ubrae they foul immediately with five seconds left. Four point game. Now Billy just has to stay away from Washington. As the sixer.
