 We'll get one more one. You ready? You game? I'm game. Three sequence, the other night that just electrified this crowd. Austin Rees has the first basket for the Lakers. Here's the Barnes goes into score. You just write that. It happens when you're playing with a four-man defense. Oh, the angel, oh, sneaks in and score. He's still up plenty of time on the shot clock. Fox, who missed a couple of games and came back in their last one, fits it from downtown. Here's the cross-court Rees. He's got his fifth point on that three. It's just a counter, right away. Counter, and one for Brawler. He's going to let it go. Comes up short. Long lead. Wait. A.D. the completion from the quarterback. He passed for Russell. He's open. That is a fresh snow. Time out. Sacrific. Herder. Good dish underneath. Throwing it down is subbonus with a left hand. A.D. Cutting baseline perfect and really away from subbonus. They came out in a zone. The Kings did after that timeout. Oh, Rees blows right past the defender in scores. What happens if you don't get the defender a chance to establish real good position? Players the number one score off the bench. The former Laker Malik Munk opened Dydwetti. Going to fire it up again. Way to go, Spence. Don't hesitate. I mean, that's what he's here for. Rees, Shubble, Huttermura. Got it. Reue Huttermura. Reue, throw it down. What a quarter for the lake show. The jolt from outside hits it. Genwetty, good ball boomer. Catch, Shubble, yes. Spence. Lakers basically the entire quarter. All they do not stop Fox. He just locks his in for a bucket. What Fox going up in there is a 10-01 to end the first quarter for the King. Saeeda, tap on the block. Taken however by Munk. Stop the pop for three. Malik Munk. For the upper one, he's only playing. And that's exactly what happened with Ellis hit in the three. And goes Delo. And you, now, open his torn in for three. Yes. Knock it down. Torian, friends. That was a good close to defend that shot by Malik Munk. The block, all it in midwange. And they keep away. Fox, look at this. Whoa. Here in Fox, what a move. They keep control of it. The perimeter work. Broad LBJ. Look out. Now he saw the lane open up. And man, he got into it in a hurry. It's Munk again, a little broader. A.D. I'm gonna stumble it out of bounds. Hatch a murrow with a left hand, but that's a goal, Tad. By-liles, counter-basket to Ruin. But fire away. Fire, when ready. Well, here comes LeBron. He throws it down. He wasn't gonna let LeBron try to chase down Block. Mitchell wide open. He casts off and we're tied at 48 after the Lakers, led by 19. Bounce. Wow. All of a sudden Sacramento on top. Timeout. Lakers down the middle. Go through. Left hand slam dunk. Murray backs up. Mitchell with three. Downtown triple. It's his third one. So far, does it look pretty quiet? And they hit again. It's a hot hit for three. Really hot. Hand from three. Yeah, missed. Box for three. Murray's gonna have a timeout bench. They'll need him. That one rolls in. Now we're setting it to the studio. Josh the Bounce out. Now report. Hatch a tough shot. Hatch tougher than the one before. That he did make because AD was looking. A tough shot. I guess nothing's tough from a leak when he's this warm. Stutter step for read in and out. Can't buy one. ADO finishes. Box. Hey, it's at the buzzer. Stutter's back in. And it's the bonus goes in. Third foul on Davis. But they are just rolling all over the Lakers right now. Thank you for being up. LeBron for three. Short rebound. It's all came right now. Look at her. I had it. Whoa. Almost like what happens. Makes almost got off the moon dream there. All the way LeBron easy doesn't. Good to land. It didn't stop. Brought. Reaves right back to Brian. Down the middle. It goes. Good feed. And just like we thought, there's a timeout. Box now. Graves a little space. And scores. Number three. One. LeBron baseline. Nothing good, Matt. Hearing Fox is after real. Yeah, any any beats. Everybody there. It's like no chance. That's just poor defense. I'm about this. Defense. Offense. Behind the head. 89.68. Time out. Rui down the middle goes all the way to score. Sabot is coming off of a 21. Rebound game. Let's get played by Rui. He just overpowering. Yeah, dude. Oh, we've played defense. Nobody. That's the right answer. Rui is trying to get to double the advantage and he does just that. LeBron trying to get to the rim all the way to score. Almost looked like a different session basket. Oh, the span of the score. The minus Sabot is. Sabot is skimming basically into the front court. No A.D. So, oh, that's a birdie. Rui's and throw it down. He's opened his Spencer dintwitty. Yes. Pass finds LeBron. Here he goes. The trying all the way down the middle of the score. LeBron has been going along. Shoot the three. Here come the lakers. Here comes the time out. One to shoot smoke. Man, he's something else, Eddie. Ellis keeps it alive. One can't duck it. Prince was there. The challenge. Kristi-free. Yes. Fox trying to restore order just just that. Again, last year's clutch performer. LeBron got it. Tough not to add a layout. A month pass. Sabot is finished. The point is to strike right by LeBron. Fox. Tori and Prince, couple of big steps. And throws it away. Three on two. Bunk is the middle man. Good feed at the last second to Ellis. Who finishes? Turn over. Number nine for the lakers. Sabot is. Andy only in Stumpley, which is against Depa. Gotta figure out how to beat those guys. Subway. Davis finally gets another hoop. He's four out of 12. Relic Bunk. Quick step. Scoop it score. So that crazy comeback against the clippers that was led by LeBron. But you know, that doesn't happen often. LeBron kind of a standing 15 footer. He's looking to throw it inside the Anthony Davis. They took that away. At Rui Scores. Rob Rui got it. He's the one they do with the Aaron Fox. He's got the basketball right now. It gets a poke. That's hit. And score. LeBron was a defender in front of him. Lyle is stumbling down. LeBron looking to turn. Go all the way and spin it in. Now let's again LeBron trying to wheel the lakers. Rui. Slam dunk. Taino. Relic Bunk off the window. Now we bounce up. Bonus. Yes. Fox wanders into the lane. All the way. Put it up in. KV-10 footer. Got it. Fox. That probably put it away. Rui's three. Oh, he banged it in. Fox. Goes around Zelo, LeBron's in and scores. LeBron's in and scores. 42 of the night. 32 guard here. Look at 68. Fox on the way. Got it again. He's got it again. As hot as more at scores. By the way, the lakers have not committed a foul. So if they want to send him to the free throw line. Oh, they steal it. Rui keeps the line. And this game is over. 10 point. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox. Fox.
