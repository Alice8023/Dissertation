 You ready? You game? I'm game. Here's Dundesley remaining scoreless, a fucking a half in. Dundesley slowly works his way inside, goes to Lively, who hooks and scores. Lively's hands, there's a cutter and Mitchell, Mitchell puts it up, and it's hit by Mowley, grabbed eventually by Mowley again, and now it's Garland who fires a three. Hey, knocks it down. Mitchell now works on Washington on the switch, the shot clock shows three, Mitchell fades away. And score. So here's Dundesley's leading story. Dundes gets his A inside, looks it up and in, gets fouled and Luke a judges. As a chance, the three point play. And then, Mitchell tries to set it back to Allen in the reflection, continuing here by both sides. Dundes, there he finds Washington. He wants for 23-7. Whoa, that's cool. Tending and nothing's called. With that ball clearly hit the backboard first. And we play on Dundes, Lazy's went into the corner of Irving, and I'm cross-dondes. And then he works at his own pace. They see, he's as horrible to watch. Yes he is, I mean, he doesn't go fast. But this goes in his own pace. And he's dead. Mitchell looks to knife inside. That was not the way. He's got by Irving, Irving doubles the dodge. And Dundes down the road, middle of the line. That was too easy. He has to look at Dundes. Dundes, the hesitation to have been toward Laverne. He got really deep there. And he sees Dundes has nine early points to go along with for a sip. And a second three of this opening cool, nerdy. And then he's got to have a 70 win. It's nabbed and there's a steal. Laverne to Laverne. Laverne to the basket. Bakes it up on hand. Lively. Laverne comes and gets it. LaKora was opened. He'll fire. J. knocks it down. What a confidence throw by Isaac LaKora. LaKora who got a hand in there originally. To knock it away from Tyree. He's eating around Lively. Oh, George. Good score. Thank you. He's flipping in here. In his first half, as Moby starts going over to Laverne. Burden fires a three speaking of bench points. Cavalier bench has it more of their six three. Mitchell's back. And he says there's one for the starters. Let's get started, baby. He kept the postman's on the defensive side of the ball. Because he knows offensive comes. Mitchell. And there's that off. And Mitchell on the other side of the break drilled a three. Awesome when they can see it. Johnson's back in the ball. The handless the back in all the boot. But he knows the face from the target. And knock it down. Johnson's knocks over Alan Lobs inside. There was Gafford. Easy pickings for Gafford. Daniel Gafford came to watch. And those big men have certainly helped his Bavartini. And Bruce has certainly helped the Cavaliers to take the chance of the role of the dice. I would say so. You don't want this, but Bruce inside it with the rejection of Johnson. Real is way to the basket. Bruce made the play. Get that reach to find it in. Yeah, Mitchell. Hey, knocks it down. And Gafford is through. He approached the two-minute mark of the second quarter. The Cavalier lead is 11. Little Johnson's long range. Oh, my. If you talked about it earlier, the Cavs will continue to switch it up on Loca. Give him a different personnel. Different looks. Loca's step back. It continues to do that. It's been shot clocking game, Buck. Dodgers. This time, works on Mowley. Step back for free. And he is feeling it here in his first half. A close to half a race point. He's watched here by Darius Garland. Birmingham gets his side. Twist the floats. And gets the roll. Now, outscrolls Dodgers. A lot of... Lively makes the catch. Banks is through. Mowley saves it gets it back to Bruce. 64-60. Bruce is the Cavalier lead. That time, Mitchell. Dan's the three. Donovan has four. And replaced by Clevon Hardaway. Irving in the corner. LLV and score. We did the other than the first half. The advantage went out and got some reinforcement. Turned into that front line. And his guy re-urving is heating up. Here in this third quarter. Joe's pushing off. That's blocked by Alan. It's definitely stuff out of you. Leverk of the foul and off the mid. He squares. He shoots. Dodgers takes the lead fast. 18 points grab the season high at 12 rebounds. He defends Dodger and Dodgers. Go to the high flyer and Joe's done. George Kneegh hands off. My theory is Garland Garland's looking for Mowley and he finds it. Kav's been looking for that. Leverk, meanwhile, between the circles he started by Green. Or since the Mowley gets it back, he's late in the shot clock. Leverk's runner is true. The Green can't make the Cavs pay. It's a quarrel. Who tracks it down? Dumps off in the trailer. Garland. The Mowley who finds him again. Will you break it all? Throw it down. You're talking about situational shots. That's a killer when Lukas draws about four of the Cavaliers and Green had that wide open look. Lukas works his way inside. He banks his scores. Dunches now. S-37. Lip between two of the Mavericks finds a Coro. Kneegh's there. But he chooses. He got run up the line by hard away, but it does not matter. It's George Kneegh now. There was the reason for the call. As Dunches from the elbow connects again. Lyle is straight away. Dunches is leaned on by a Coro. Death's back. Fires a contested three. Oh my. Whoo. Man. 42 now for Dunches. We're tied at 93. Dunches. Look for an answer. He does. Hard away wasn't shooting. That's the retreat back to the corner. Irving now. Lateness shot clock. Woohoo. Mavericks 98 points. Lukas Dunches in Kyrie Irving. Washington down the lane. Draw the bow. It's a de-go. BG washes in it. Has a chance for three. Here's Dunches. Dunches looks into the four. Of course. Stop. Fire. Throw it. That's it. Yeah. I knew they needed the score. They needed the score. I was not sure if they could have played this game again. But they had the first round. They took the lead by an a crowd. They played here and walked in the wheels inside. Fires an open flip off for three. Max learned that. Leba has given the Mavericks. And has to be put a cat. But it's a defensive finish in the four. Leba sends it back to Irving Irving. Finger rolls inside. Kyrie now has 25. True. Back he goes to Missile. Takes the bump from hard away. Spruce fires a three. Hey. That's it. the contest but spruce by his third long range bomb of the night. And that's one of the reasons why they've been able to stay in control of the game because of that. Oh, it's a capitalized. That was a maverick's first turn ever since the 836 mark of the second order. Irving long range. Oh, brother. Mitchell, he bites through. It's true. It looks to stay hot. And he does. Time the open man. Out comes Mitchell. He'll find Garland. Garland off this truth. Struse with another. Oh, my word. Shoot. It's unwashed it. Garland takes it three. Dumps back to Mitchell. Hellfire. Hey. Knocks it down. It's Donovan Mitchell has given the Cavaliers a lay. He's presenting an opportunity here. It's knocked away from Mitchell. Gotcha. Back to Green. We're tied. Turn over in the back. Garland is picked up by Irving. Mitchell is garner by Green. Use the Nallenskreet. Fire the green. And Nilsett. Mavericks have one. Irving. Works on Laverke. It's inside. Flows it up and floats it in. That cuts the Cavalier leads to one. You're in a situation you can't have anybody get an easy shot. So you've got to hit by mobility. But Dodgers gets it back. Dodgers. Dumps inside Washington. Hooks it in. Two seconds left. The cows are out of time. They have to go 94 feet. Struce from mid-gore. Oh. Did you believe this? Oh. Mary. Dickens. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Max Truce. From mid-gore. Has wanted for the Cavaliers.
