 They can't get out hustles. That's right because these guys are playing for jobs for next year. A lot of them. And then Tyas Jones who's an incredible talent for the backboard. He was backly again deflection by C. J. Anantiak coming off career best 25. You know he's feeling good. You got it. It is Washington and they lead by one. Good for a step. The backly is active. Well, and I'm also is coming off a good game on the board. He's one of the guys. He's one of the reasons that may. Got a dunk. There you go. That may Daniel Gafford expendable because it bring a lot of the same things that live behind the player. Five on four. Good catch by yours. That was a low balance. Her. And her. So much. That's what he does. And perfect pass by. But. Larry Jean for Yodas C. J. Strong. But $24 C. J. $24. All five starters and scored of course now. Brandon against the rock. Sherison. Good take. And how about a runner? I think it's interesting. You knew when C. J. hit that shot of the glass. Larry. That's it. That's it. That's it. So easy. He just had to wait and get to a spot when he knew he had Jones on it. The Walgreens coupon. Can I get an extension? You got to tomorrow to use it. You got your barcode. Back to a runner. Nice one. Good luck. Good luck. That's picking up wind. Yeah, but thing is you held two NBA teams under 86 points in both those games. Again. That's roll and replace. They say, say, get action. Cory Kisper coming about corner. And the pocket free zone. Here's the thing. Rasione Holmes is not a post today. I was poke joy by Rasione. All right. Desire. Died. Try to beat. And that was good. Good job. And now you being shot ready. Surprise guys haven't gone to 80. Now. And he actually felt. J. Highs. I think Judy 50% now. Just low start to the outside. Shadow on the run. He's on. I'm sure it was trying to be couple. He's by set the match in their largest lead. And it's going to be active. Active hands. Now you get an opportunity to switch everything. It's give you a chance to play just like this. Just like this. Now you can speed up the game. Stayed on there. I'll get there. And get such a soft touch around that round. He makes those shots look like they're easy shots. I love the move. I love the move. I will be going small. This small unit right here. Six of the work. And on the euro. They have completely. They've completely opened this game up. They're plus off the charts. Double figures for everybody from the bench. He's the lead. The NBA. Seven and a half to one. He is a really talented smart player. He points at 16 minutes action. Deep one. Starters back. The other something. He's got a good stroke. He didn't hesitate on that one. And a general bad one. It was in Sacramento. But Brandon. That was decisive. W. W. Now Joe. Good morning. Well, you were early off it. See Jay. The others. Then I'm a matchup. B.I. See Jay. Beautiful pass. You said it, Joe. It's pasted. Good guy. Gisbert. Looking for help. As Joe knows at the end of the shot, he's got six points. He's got six points. He's playing with a lot of force. He's aggressive now. See, this is. Right. We talked about it all the time. How effective that can be. Now in Borngay. The others five to six. They don't have anything to lose. In the post. See. Go. You can hear their coach from here screaming. Go, go, go. The moment they sign out, cut that basketball. It's a great look for Gisbert. Brandon tried to box him out, but you got it back. They get another triple of the second chance. Borngay's time out, Pell. He's going to get his attempts. Brandon shares it. He's got a third. Gang it to corner three. They have now hit eight of their last 11 triples. I'll be all the way to the cup. Denny, I'm putting on a show. He's got 23 now with nine boards. You said it before, though. Like, you know, with young players, they beat off energy. It's taken away by Pistons and lead for Washington. Inside, Z's got the early shapes. He's into her, that's going hard. He had a free run. He did have a free run. With pool. And nobody there. Pool gets the follow. And two is here, rebound. So he's got a double double with 27 and 10. That's communication here. Easy left. That's communication. Time out, Pell. Flat foot. Here to be C.J. Fan of the long rebound, Larry. Extra pass. Brandon VIII. Yes. Needed it. His second triple. Pell's only down three. C.J. on the run. And Brandon on the fly by. Go get him, B.I. Go get him. Shoot him back into the game. Oh, boy. Jose. Trying to get the little for under. Any will. Over time. Jones. Good read. I like it. Pick him up full court. And opportunity to tie or take the lead. A little more than three to play. Now, how do you close the third? Right. C.J.'s float right. Go into the long rebound. How do you close the third? Hopefully a lot better than you close the second. See, he's waving everybody out. Because he likes, this is what I mean. He wants his match up. Right. And it'll be a perfect match. That's what I mean. You got to take a stand on, bro. Because they're doing everything through Robby. This is the match up I like right there. Step back three. You got to live with that. That's a tough job. 34 for Robby. But you said it right now. He's in his own. Ziggets the switch. Spins on Optia and gets the floater. And just for us to stop. On the run. Jose. And gets the roll. Starts with a stop. The end of the try. So the tallies to the officials. And there should be a good one. It's controlled. On a time. Now, can he get it off in time? I'm going to get it off. I'm going to get it off. I'm going to get it off. I'm going to get it off. I'm going to get it off. Now, can he get it off in time? Yep. Wow, Cyan. All the way to the left. I tell you. Here's the thing. You have to keep Marvin Bagley on the glass, though. And here's Jose. He comes up with a steal. He's got Nudge on the trail. And C. He'll get there. Pass by. Oh. Brandon. Youros. And Bagad. Got it out. Good. Nudge. Nudge. You'll get there. Now, you play very well. Double figures 13 off the bench. Larry. And Rose in a way. Box your friend. Bring it back out. Ty has Jones. I'll be out. He's not all night. And he gets another. And it's no visual. All-Star break is here. And the pals are 11 over 500. And you'll red-drow. And you'll get a new one. And you'll get a new one. And you'll get a new one. And you'll get a new one. And you'll get a new one. And you'll get a new one. And you'll get a new one. And you'll get a new one. And you'll get a new one. And you'll get a new one. And you'll get a new one. And you'll get a new one. And you'll get a new one. And you'll get a new one. You'll get a new one. And you'll get a new one. And you'll get a new one.
