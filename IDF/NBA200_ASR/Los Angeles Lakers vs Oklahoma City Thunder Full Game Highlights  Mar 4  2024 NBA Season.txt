 roads for enclosure. Is? A That's the one guy you don't want to split on, anti-David when he's in the post, especially. Check for 3-80 rattles at him. Organs, gutted by Bilo. Look at this matchup. Organs, ult really deep. Jets got it again. Left hand, scores. Second chance opportunities. Ruin reverse lap is good. Got his ease as it looks. The blinding, the attacking 47. Lob to A.V. He'll finish it off. There's a lute door, three. Got it. Gomes Bilo. Just inside the free throw line. It's good for the Angela. Bilo, who did play much. In shoot, clutch in the second half against Denver. They find Gidey for his third layup of the game. Points in the paint so far in the game. 12 for OKC. Lakers look right there. Second in the lead. Ruin, Hatchamara. They averaged as Austin gets when they go. They averaged 130 points of game in nine games on the second night of a back to back. Four hand. It's been a while for him. Giles was out of Zadda, blocked by Anthony Davis. Reads with 230 behind clutch moving. Here in the first. Rebo. Yes sir. Blocked by Dindritty. Got a point. Now it's a one on five. Got it. Got a point. Now, what is he? Remember, he is now with his team and they find Kesson. Wallace, on the left side for a three. Hungren, good luck. Turn around jump shot. Corian Grince. Pull up the 10. Nice shot. That was a nice decision. Two minutes ago. Now what if he goes to any further into the paint? Get Hungren with waiting for you. Good neat. We'll get to that in a second. Of Jackson has finishes. Here comes Lepland. Grince over a man of scores. Look out. Here comes the train. All the way. They don't pick up Russell. Who scores timeout? The Bron underneath. Tap once. Tap once. Shuffle pass. We can just underneath. Blocked again by the Lakers. For their defend in the paint, aren't they? If anything about OTC, they will finish games well. You got a really established lead. And that's why he's not panicking about this turn around. Leudor. Finally. They are off of the drought with Leudor. Leudor. Leudor. Timeout. Garvin Hampt. Tell him to hold on to the ball. It's a good ball broom into Leudor. I'm going to try it right side, right hand. For both sides of the court, Leudor has been successful. From three. Leudor. Pull up. Nice move. Deelo. Straight into the basket. Fighting, A.D. Slam. Leudor. He's done. Leudor. He's got a score. He's got a defense offense. Well, that's what happy when they turn it over. Russell got it. He would do to get one. You know, the answer to this shoot it so well. It's really shooting for the board quarter. Two days ago, Filtres, Alexander. Nothing but an A.D. Leudor, the scoop of the score. Again, off the ball, cut to the basket. Give your team a good card. Very fortunate that it got to get it. Who's going to win? Ten point in the lane. What a defensive effort by the lake show. Oh, the pass. Finish you Leuron and one. What a defensive sequence though. France and David. Love that sound. And Paul going through the net. Plus 12 and rebounding in the first half. Look at this rainbow. How to gold at the end of that flip. Joseph Alexander. Hachepurra was the man trying to defend Jay. He turned around and hit the jump shot. Joseph Alexander got caught in the air. Lebron lead, Ruin, two beat steps to score. I told you they've been historically good. There's another three points. That's his fifth by the game. Underneath Lebron is a long lead in. Good move there by Lebron. Just a simple little ball fate. Williams. You talked about how he's such a big part of their team. They're locked into a piece to play. That one rolls around and settles in for home grip. Fifth turn over for Reeves. Five of them. Home was there behind the back. Score it. Time out. Reeves will shake it back. DeLo. Williams tries to get in the lane. He's going to go from downtown and he switches it through. Austin's wide open. It makes no mistake. Reeves three. And now try to go back in. Work, work, work. Work they did for the dunk. James wide open. Makes no mistake. LBJ. He's here at the other end. Calder. Man will. Well, you do that was going to happen, but they stay for a day miss. But then he shriebs it in anyway. DeLo. Well, he makes a look so smooth. And he can't believe nobody can pick him up. Hey, what? I've played a lot since coming over. And he hits the jump shot. I wanted to ask Stu about Spencer doing what he's defense. Oh, but he's just been a little lower. Defensive ago. Been pretty impressed at least down here on the sideline. Yeah, I have been too. James spin. Shoot it. Storm. Look out. Ball bullet finds reddish. Look at him throw up. A circus player. He's got to hit him. He hit him. He hit him. Right place, right town. Prince. On its way. Down it go. Wow. I mean, he shot that really quick. He hits so much time. Oh, Prince. He bounces off the one defender countered in one. The run down the belly goes. Hold with India. The veteran. The all-time leading storm. The run with the lead. He loads up shot. Not in any way. I knew he knew the boxer. The defender was right. He did. Oh, Creel. Coming back. Williams. I don't know how to tie up a run. We they don't. So that'll look away pass. It's just a step back for Russell. Fresh snow. There he is. Try to put it in. No, no. Look at that. No, no. There he is. No, no. No, no. There he is. No, no. We've got to be joking with him. Got a couple of substance. We can't see him. That one's laid up at end. What's going on? Is it in? Big Mike. The moose. He's still going in underneath. They're up at end. Get it, Williams. We'll see Hatchuk. Murah. Look at Austin Reed. Here is Prince of Gert, if you're listening. You're the man. Torrin Prince having a nice night from behind the arc. Now three out of four. Prince. Yes. Riggins. Long distance. He's going to be in the back. He's going to be in the back. He's going to be in the back. He's going to be in the back. Long distance. Right to the bottom of the well. Going that out of nowhere, Williams. Nice. Way to go, Jack. I'll tell you when Jackson Hayes hits that trampoline. He elevates, boy. I know he's seven foot, but still. He's got some serious bounce. Legers owning. Okay, see right now. There's a three knockdown by Wiggins. Max. Christine. Whoa. Yeah, just how I planned it. Shooters touch. You want to talk about a guy who's career has been dissafe by Andrews. Jiles. Yeah. He's going to young career too. Yeah, very much so. And Skull of the Rage. Got it. So there's Jiles. We went to Duke for a season, laid up an end. Or the X-King, the X-Player, doing several injuries. And this is it for OK. See if they will win the season series against the now number one team in the West. Waters. Big win. Big win. You
