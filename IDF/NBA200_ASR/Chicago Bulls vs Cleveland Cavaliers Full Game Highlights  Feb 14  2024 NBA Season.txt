 First play of the game a couple of nights ago they went to the sumo. My downstop working against Garland now. The first time they were in the game, they were in the same game. They were in the same game. They were in the same game. They were in the same game. They were in the same game. They were in the same game. They were in the same game. They were in the same game. They were in the same game. They were in the same game. They were in the same game. They were in the same game. They were in the same game. He was recently added to the USA basketball pool of players for the upcoming Olympics. DeRosen has already a gold medal. middle, and the bigger staff is telling us about it more than just a shooter. You guys, that's so much toughness and a motor that won't fit in this round. As it is. Threws back to Mitchell. He snakes the screen. Scrages into the corner, Mowgli is going to repition three point shooter. Green up work on the glass. So, where Craig walks into the three ball, that's great butter folk. Mitchell off the Spagula section. Got it! Mitchell. Such as the paint, one more to the bird, back to the corner. A four-and-one open, and he has really increased his three point. Richard Betts has a little bit of a mismatch here. Now the double-tops. One more to Terry. Backflark at three, and the jumper fuel. Now, who is looking for a double-double? Jerusalem finds, who's missed one of time. And he got his goggles. Mitchell, double-t. Got the bulls in rotation, a bull again. I think that's a game changer, Bob. The water from H. Yang with the board, Cleveland, trailing by nine, and they give it away again. Caruso gets the layup to fall. First the defensive back, nobody wanted to throw. Chris Phanon tied the back, and the recipient better be moving toward him. He's in place already. Coral has had his way at the offensive end, and that's... ...portunity himself. The Rosen, a Maestro in the mid-range, and there's the proof. Tell you what, you look at his shape. Stroose, cross-court to Carlin. Inside to Mobley. Knocked down that turn around with that seventh-foot-pourage ring. Seriousness, and the work. The Rosen on the pro. Got it in one. Demar Derosen, exploding at the Riddest work-hattles. Derosen draws the double-team, like one more to the corner. The sumo for three, laces in, and the bulls executing well offensively. Here's Derosen against Stroose. Got to a spot, like Werner. He just defied his career. Get to his spot. To 29. Carlin sneaks the screen to the elbow. A higher. Somebody's got to steer the coach. Talking about your own coach. Niaing with a circus shot. See that guy? Don't watch him getting close. Mitchell splits the double-team. And he's flying charter, folks. Donovan Mitchell with nine. That most defensive say no-middle, and he finds a way. He just down to eight. Not for long, Alex Caruso catches out. Doesn't matter if he scored on, doesn't matter if he got the best of one. He's coming back with great effort. Whiteback, Neil Kling, Leopard on the move. Back to the rim and lays it home. It's a put his head down. Back out to Leopard. Why open? Got it. And the lead is here. Cavaliers ended the second on a 14-3-1. Here's Poochis. Drum and pounding the glass. It wasn't that long ago. Mitchell off the Allen screen. And heavy traffic got it. Just a big-time screen. That is such a big-time screen by Jared Allen. Shed it, hold it, and let your off gets a player to the world. And a big-time bucket at the other end, a counter for Kobe White. Here's Garland over to Struse for three. Got it. Extruse with his first three ball of the night. And the highly-touted three-hanging white. Drum and set a good screen. Three up white for the baseline jumper. He's ever going to be a guy who hunts shots. He'll take those ones. He's a guy getting it. But he's eaten by chronological age. And worse than gone. For his first couple years is another jumper for Kyle Ghostdown. Makes the one more pitch down pass. Mitchell's short jumper comes up a little bit short. And Moby here for the little cleanup. In the back court with Mitchell. A deep three. Oh, top of Mitchell. Brass court, then put your picture in the open look. That's the world who's the world. He stretches the floor, which is ready to check in. Oh, man, Mitchell. Baseline feed to a four. Got it. A couple of the season on it. The Rose and the folks. I work for tomorrow, Rosie. Well, in the period for Mitchell. For three. What an answer by the bull. That's a big time. Make sure the patient is down. Can you continue to keep the pressure out of Chicago? Why not to the bird off the bench? Carp along the cutting. A deep three. Got it. Kobe got a seven for white. Bulls of D3. Got it. Kobe white got a crop bond. Heavy duress. Time we bump its open over for Lennon. Bob Lee counters at the other end of the two. Last game for the Oscar. Be your job to fix it. This time they won that prize. Lovely good and genuine. The Dragon Barley triple-lippery jumper. White fires. Another one. They've taken the lead with Mitchell on the bench here. We call to Zoom. Make the ring. Make the Marillion. Make this one. White. Oh, good defense by Mitchell. Struse on the drive. Got it to fall. Great answer, patient. The rose in the beginning. Wine drive that melts in the rim. Mitchell goes to Struse. Great pocket pass. Spray it to the wing. Wonderful ball movement. You can't catch by telling him to come home. I can't get out of here, boy. There's a lot of boys and bros. Big reason why this might be a different cavalier team. A couple of days will then play off time. A bunch of it. Mitchell. Corral to buy white. Snakes the screen and gets open. Got it. Five. The rose in out top. Only can guard one through five. That's a six time all star in Olympia. Great catch to keep it in bounds. Mobile. The turnaround. Got it. Wow. That's the shot, though, it's broken. I'll tell you, opportunistic. I got top six on the shot block. Got to get busy. Playing with his move over. Oh, yeah. Wow. This is about the minutes restriction. And he makes that shot. Got 10. Bucky White got an answer for everybody. Time's it at one old finish. Little anxiety seducing. Mitchell, 10-11 of the three through line. And now 11 of 12. That was it long. And the lead is back up to three. Three. Close to it makes the catch. Looking for white on the D.H.O. For the time. And it comes off. Happy Valentine's Day, Cleveland. Thank you.
