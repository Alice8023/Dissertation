 Welcome to the one. You ready? You game? I'm game. You can't judge this team just by wins and losses. They've been playing better. Despite the fact that they've lost eight in a row in five straight, because the loss three straight, they sit in fourth in the West. Now, your pitches in the lane sets up order for them. Nice looking three. That's the first. Now, Marvin Bagley, who came over to trade, give it the tires. Jones is playing well. He floats it up and in. Dias Jones, very underrated. Mentioned eight straight losses by Washington, including the last three on the road. And a little swoop inside and Bagley puts it up and in. No matter who you're playing, order already with five into quarter. Who's a well and porter out of mouse in the house. Scott Dias Jones. Order the rebound. Order averaging about 16 points per game. Now, he's got it. Lay it up and in. Another rebound for Yokech. Law pass. Goons out there. Pants it. Push that away. Precision pass. Find a call out. Yokech playing hard. Call one full. Thought he was fouled. Now, Corey Schis put his in. Give it to Jones who lets it go and hits. Now, he's got it. Dias Jones off to a nice start. Oh, that's my assess. And Gordon. Sucks it in there. Goons like send us a back. Miss pass. Gordon's got it. Look out. And Gordon plays it. That was good. They're good. Yeah, this is never had the triple double. Against the Washington Wizards. The lost the ball there. And Johnny Davis is out and lays it in. Going away. And a great block by Zieg Mausier. Brown's got it. Coming over from the Leach side. Murray does it. What a play. You've missed the offense. And the minute. Pull. He lost the foul and hits the bucket. And a shamot. And now Kisper's on the round. Christ the dunk. Watson was there. Christian Brown coming in. Spiral foul. Yeah. And straight moving your point. You just get there a lot, buddy. And then he's going to be in the lead. And then he's going to be in the lead. And then he's going to be in the lead. And then he's going to be in the lead. And then he's going to be in the lead. And then he's going to get there a lot, buddy. Make it. That's good. Oh, well. And he hits the three. That's good. Very good. After a nice start. Six out of eight. Now gets blocked. Kusper lets it go and hits. Yeah, that's just bad luck. You got guys. Look at Shandon just being physical. And quarter. Quarter's got it. Coming on Kusper. Nice. And Bagley in on Yokech. And he gets a concession basket. Quarter with 18. To lead the parade. Nice pass. And an excellent cut there by Christian Brown. Powered up. No hand off. Reggie Jackson. Get the Yokech. Yokech. Fanking and laying it in. Bagley is hot. It's basically trying to adjust to the taped up finger, with the right hand. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. I'm going to make it. Yeah. That's a good one. That's a good one. Very good. That's a good one. Very good. Stating here. Perfect joint right ball. kwestes, here isside penalty points. And the scoop. That's the third hole. Yeah. You missed the rope. So the tie's the inner force. Beратed by Brad answered out place. Nate comes in. Can you give me one moment? No. Ricky 37 gets blocked he hit the knee. And it high heat up back position. Next hundred reps. I have had no mistake here. So goalolo did it. And another international throw. Perfect one. and then he ob-second remaining. Kuzma got it again. He's getting back into a game real quick. Just keep firing the three to get low and shoot down. Sorry didn't shoot it and steady close it away. Although the nugget's being tentative here. Once again, Yoke is one assist away from the triple-double. It's first day's 15th rebound tonight. Play here in the third quarter, four, Grammy speed. They're going to cap that. He went into Kuzma. Bolly balled out by Bagley. Kuzma. And Kuzma knocks it in. Kuzma, he checked. Oh, got it. And was knocked down by Paid Watson, who helps him up. 64 Denver. And C. Chancin, the movement from Blazor's from one night. Yoke is still sitting up at him. And Yoke is with this. 60 point. As Mr Schmitz has to merge. Murray. Terhan. No team. Porter's got it. But it's not me at the end with a third. It's out of finish. Almost two on selfish. For the Denver guys. Watson, another block. He goes ahead and McCullough Yoke is watching. Peyton Watson is Ash. Small lineup for Washington. Kuzma. Kisper in the main lay it up it in. Not since Chris Anderson back in the day, the bird. Obviously. Nox in the three. And the weak side for some reason. Biggest lead was 28. Another step. And the nuggets just playing careless. Watson from behind, another block. Jones let's it go and wow, the nuggets in the middle. And the free point opportunity here. Eight on the shot clock. And Murray has a steel bad pass. Holiday. Laudanagy. And he puts it away. Now nice assist, unselfish. The wizard's running with Kuzma, Paul, Kisper Davis, and Omo Ruyo. And out the holiday. And holiday throws it down. Fans like that. He's a real player. He's a real player. Murray's got it. Murray. Trickler. Got it. Jamal, Masha, and it'll get open three looks. Kisper. A block again. Ziknaji. Believe that's three. How does it shoot the three? That's good. Kuzma's got it. Oh, no. Oh, no. Man, a wide open tree at Kisper knocks it in. That may ran to the lane worried about. Jones cut off. And the three is good. They're just raining and freeze down. Getting off the good start. Hitting the ground running as to the term he used. Holiday for three. Got it. And Yokech, another assist. Pass underneath. Intercepted. Kuzma's got it. And he's the way for a dunk. That's one of the bad things Denver has done. Jackson, Indio, he's got it. He's turned. He puts it up and in. 19, he's got a 54 rebounds. But he juxtaposed that in. He lays it in. That might get him going. Trick Game Blues, Trick, coming in. One thing they struggle that. Oh, my. Unless you're a Michael was doing right there. He just left the ball he had. Get him to go down. Yokech hand off the goal. Back to Yoke. Yokech in the lane.
