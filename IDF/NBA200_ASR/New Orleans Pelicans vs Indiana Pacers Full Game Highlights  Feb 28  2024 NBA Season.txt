 This should be a good one, Beth. Black jerseys for Indy White for the Pills. The late trip here overnight. This Valentina skits, it's stripped and Indy will push. That's Valce Accombe. Can I pick up for them in January? Absolutely. He has only missed 11 games, which is fabulous for him. And is unfortunate injury history? That was a terrific shot by CJ. No real rhythm yet. Oh, turn. Spinning away. The Valentina skits to knock it down. Let's open some things up inside. Opportunity is knocked for Bios in particular. He gets the finish, assisted by Ciacca. Feels very much like the second day of a back-to-back for the Pills though so far. Still trying to figure some things out. Here's Indy. We put a turner in his face, count it, and a foul. Absorbing the contact even at that slim frame, a great taking again at high release. Another assisted basket. As Ciacca scores inside, that's five of their seven buckets. The standings are just nutty on both sides of it. Quarter three is good from Ben Shepherd, who's just checked in. The working out of Belmont. Under the hoop in a terrific pass by Egor. Here's the comment into the game. And immediately picks up a dish to Halibur. Better than 60 percent so far tonight in the first quarter against one of the better defensive units in the NBA. Already seven different guys have scored for the Pacers. Now touch the paint first. Williamson, oh nice hesitation. And then he's been at the rim and blocked. Haliburton the other way for the jam on the run. Obi-Toppin throws it down. Differential game clock, shot clock. McCollum followed Zion down the lane and a breakout for Haliburton with plenty of time. Off the window for Toppen. McCollum tracks it down looking for a seventh assist. Another opportunity for the Pacers. And TJ will take it himself. Jones gets it back to Zion and that time he's up in the air first. And operating a little pick and roll there with Herb Jones. Maddering. Marshall's got it. McCollum the trail three. Good. McCollum and Herb Jones were really chattering away at one another. Lawrence was bringing the ball up the floor and now that's a couple buckets in a row for Zion and Rick Carlyle wants to talk about it. I don't know about a fan section for NBA fans. That's the one. I'm not sure about that part though. We'll see how that takes our way. In the ring. Short. Three players he's around it but they tipped it right too. Moffy. Counting. It's going to be important for them to get some ball movement in their half-course. This is a good mismatch for Ingram to take advantage of. Which he does. Well off the mark but they'll get another look. A very confident shot. Ingram no. See I can put the cherry pick for the jam. Williamson missed the land. NEMARD. Three ball is good. And celebrate his birthday tomorrow. Final minute of this first half. Ingram looking for some help at Herb. Give some the back door cut. The great read by Herb Jones. Grandadinger was essentially stuck. Oh no. Wow. Wide open three from the corner. Albert will set the screen for Cianca right back to Tyrese. Or we passed up the three. We'll step inside the line and hit. Starwatch brought to you by Metro by T-Mobile and by DJ Kool. And your DC connection. There it is. DJ Kool. And the last half of the record. Jordan Hawkins hit a three. Herb Jones hit a couple of buckets. And there's that run out again for the Pacers. Maddener and blocked by Nance. And able to scoop it back up in ends. You got to make some things happy. There's so much excitement around the three of these guys. When they're all together. And there's Ingram. Nice and feed. He kept alive by Smith. Little work between back to MR. Sixth assists for Haliburton. More assists than shots taken so far for Tyrese. Here he is with the push. It'll give it up to the Bigfella. Sixth number seven. Time out, New Orleans. They could get that young man going. It could change the complexion of what the Pelicans can do. Haliburton will try again. Seems five different results this time. Don't love that shot. I'll be honest with you back. I would agree with you on that one. Had other options. And more of this, the Defender fly by. So essentially a six point swing off of Mississippi. And to make it the other way. This is the same thing that happened in the third quarter. You chip into the deficit. And then you don't get back and give up easy best. Now that one, we like that one to better. Smith. In and out. It's a really good three point shooting team, I guess. One of the best three teams. He's a really upset. Scat is for the Marshall lab. The Pelicans defense in the last few possessions has really held the line. They've done a good job of keeping the pace in front of them. Haliburton. Sweet three. Smith inside. And Shepherd has picked up that role. McConnell with his passing ability. Everybody's doing their job for this second unit. Shotclots winding down. Bathroom. Oh, sweet thing. Got a hook. Come with to lead the other way. Florida goes for Zion. And knocked down three of those already in today's ballgame. You mentioned coming off that 34 point performance. And one opportunity for Zion. If they're going to, it's going to be as much of a focus as anything else. They can't give up those wide open baskets in transition. Bathroom. Yeah, that was CJ's fourth. Triple E's got 14. Ingram 21. Zion with 18 for the pells. Down by as many as 20 have gotten to within five. And now they're chipping away against. Zion had a really good one too tonight. He did. He wants the screen from McConnell. Gets the switch. Gets the smaller defender. Gets the finger roll. McConnell keeping that dribble alive. And Gets the land. Just relentless work. Steps back, talking. Mates him out there. And it's tip forward and work out. Oh, me. Oh, me. Oh, me. McConnell will try and lead one more charge for New Orleans. Williamson with the left hand. Robin is Zion now at 20. Picks it back out to Zion. What a good one. It's good. It's really smart. He's like a smart guy. He's like a smart guy. He's like a smart guy. He's like a smart guy. He's like a smart guy. He's like a smart guy. He's like a smart guy. He really smart. He's like a smart guy. He really smart. He used the screen there. Se�огam. Spins and lays it out before him. And he ends it here. How a Burton will step back and NIOT going here. Five on the shotgun. for the assist. And how he's going after this switch. He wants Zion to have to go in. How long per minute? Albert. It's by Finacy. Who floated in from the weak side? 11th to 6th for Albert. That's his average leads the league and he'll pick up another one here. 24 for Siacum and they will get the win here at home. 44 bench points to bet. White the performance as a
