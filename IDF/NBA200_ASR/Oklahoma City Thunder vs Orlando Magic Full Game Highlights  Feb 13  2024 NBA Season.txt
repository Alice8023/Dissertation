 It's the two best young teams in the league. We do not have a starter in this game, Dougan, who's older than 25. Sounds like the three of us, we're not older than 25 either. Remember when coach is to call a term fight for me? I was not passing on that first position. It's Ludoert for three, and Males at the Mount Side. His defense is calling, Cudd. That's your Horkia be year. And the Cudder, Good Feed. And there's one Junkie Ditzett and another. With a whistle and a foul, with Bligh Pumburn down it inside. And now it sucks. Indigating. Good Feed. Cudder, Altsabanko, Shock Locket 4. Doubleed. It's a three-time matchup goalies in his cut-out side by Julian Suck. 45% three-point shooter and a good one. But top five percentages in the league from their distance. Fast spin. And they get us a goal, Pink Carrier. Post-move and you see me picking roll pass. Bankero inside Carter, over 100. And that change from what that reach he's got in there. A lot of times, you know, when he's going to get some shove, like we have the bump in the ticket to the fifth. Excellent move right there. Elders out, Alexander, outed by Suck. But a bump to get some separation. Here comes the magic. Seven to 13. That's a three-card. Julian Suck. Longing out the assist, and then last Williams, Dastard Harkal, the goalkeeper, Cudd, crashing to the floor. False tug it out. Gary Harris in the game. It's a three-card. Of Gilgis and Alexander. They'll take it the other way with a gallop. And Williams inside. Julian Williams gets it to go. No, I'm seeing no great sleep. By Williams. Terrible, right there. Oh, great move. Inside thriving. Wow, nice play put in. Isaiah Joe, the former 76er. Shipping his way, Isaac from the corner, three. Say by Sucks. Say by English. Right back to that man, Lou George. We're here. Giving was Harris. Where would it be? He's that's look at that three defense by Julian's. And still from Fogler gets it done. It both ends up really only got one weakness. Their weaknesses, they don't rebound the ball. It either ends at, but everything else. You look at their numbers. Isaac Fogler. Isaac. And don't know, Wallace, retreats it. Side stepping in the family, catching up with a good looking jam off the wings. slammed by Keylin Williams. What you'd be talking to him, Isaiah Thomas. You know, not a lot of guys in actual, maybe John Stockton. Getty across the lane. Vages, Alexander with a spin. He's two a seven from the field. Wiggins three card. They called one of Sucks three earlier at two. That one goes in right there by Isaiah Joe. During our commercial break, and those players are coming out. They get one of his threes to a two. Folt's Carter. That position with the doc. Coach, I'm using to help me out with my AMT. And then Volvner there goes by him. And finally one will drop after missing. Force straight now with six. Forgot about the one in practice where we had to stop practice and he broke the backboard. So I think you forgot about that one. 27. Nice shot. Shea, don't just, Alexander hit that happy. Then he said one day down. And when you're a prolific story, you forget about the first half. Second half is a mid-end and you hit your first shot and you're ready to go. He's at home for all the time. He has trouble with guys physically backing him down. Gilger's sandwich center. Oh, is he come out of this? He'll be down. He's gone for a four cents. Has it here off the side, getting with a three. Hungry. Here's the rebound. Oh, okay. Top of the sit-in. Jaylen Williams works on Folt's side step fudder throws it away. Intercepted by Sucks. Three on two. Hold on Carter. And he got it from Ben Kiro. Well, he talked about it with Oklahoma City, but Orlando second in the lead for some turnover. Well, before. Yeah, he's got it wrong with now. And that was, and he barely moved. Barely moved. Shea Gilger's Alexander. Should you say five for five? And seven for seven. Orlando Carter's third offensive. Wow. And it's called the legal screen. AKA the old school butt pit. Oh, hungry. Yes. We can get that done for now. I want all I just want to be by his friends. We can get it done for you, Alex. Oh, I know. Just to don't look like a young team. Why did all. 20 assists. I'm 32 May baskets. That's a sweet spinner by Ben Kiro. 17. There comes Anthony looking for. Right. Shake. Like one from the runway. Let's hear some magic at this parlor. Into the game. One point. He has his first one. Anthony forcing the issue over knocked it away. Defending inside of the realm. In Oklahoma City by 12 earlier this season. Oh, chapped by Isaac picked up by Jalen Williams. Trying to put the big man in the end. And then down low. Wrong move. I would personally go with Jalen Johnson in Atlanta. But this guy might be sucking on my list. He's got 23 and other sales maybe in my body. No, no. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I don't. But then they're going to do it. Two years ago. For the funders. Nice. Well, by the big man. You're checking it going out. One thing you can do as a big guy. You can never try to cross over against a little guy. Getty. That's a good pass right there. Welcome. Down it goes. Hit by Paul. All right there. Eight minutes left. See if we're on make them make one last run. Jalen Williams always got too much going on. Not with Alan Alvison. AKA Lou Williams. Wow. I'll say what? I'll get somebody to make them a little suffer on him. They can't come back. And Bob Bradner gets it over. It's at 100. They are struggling to get stopped. And Shake your gizoules in is waiting to check it. Hold on. For Williams. Jalen Williams. One guy you can't. Oklahoma City is not just a shop. This fourth quarter. Eight of eight. And Carol. Two and a half ahead. To the other front. It's a long though though is. In the fourth quarter. Sub to Carter. Carter with a three. Time are taken by Oklahoma City. Scoring just about as well with 28. He still has the fourth quarter to go. J. Gilges and Alexander is in. Dancing on here. Scott. Got a lot of work on that bench. Wow. That was again. You see it several times. I have that. That's great defense. It's caught through with a three. He's from. He puts it in. You know, they got two or three guys like the story. I got a couple guys like a 50 outside shot. I definitely say yes. Thank Carol to Carter. Endow Carter with 22. Tom Thompson is about to lose. And they don't worry about so called lack of experience going to play on. I believe that would be surprising if they were the rest of the time. I like that. What a mark. We had two 30 point games coming into the side of the middle game. 42 right there. It's on fire. No slicers way up. Cords to and a half to go. Sweet. Popeye. J. Gilges. Alexander. Boy, oh boy, oh boy. A half came back to the timber walls for number one in the Western conference. And Denver and the players are right there. Let's go. Nice.
