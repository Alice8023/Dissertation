 You ready? You game? I'm game. Down hill, you have to attack the paint with force. You cannot play on your hills and you got to get into the paint to make plays here tonight. Broadcast crews still not at 100% here tonight, but there is no load management on Space City Hall Network. So we are good to go. Glad to have you with us. And hope that the Rockets can get back to you with a wing column as Alan, who is one of the best basketball of his career, strikes first for Phoenix. The excellent post defender, the better of who he's playing against. We've seen that here. He's got sand in the pass, if you will. And why open his U-Banks is the ramp. The lift one in there, like skipping a pond. A rock on a pond. The ball movement can kick to Alan. He'll drive the lane. And he misses short U-Banks taps it out to the ramp. And he makes it from just inside the free throw line. Don't shun goon on the floor to try to get something going offensively. Good job, I'm Thompson. Red that bass beautifully. Another run out. Can't whip more off the fence, gliding to the ramp. There you go. He just checked in. There's O'Neill. O'Neill is father. Young with three bound. Now the whole ball with all that length. Missed the scoop shot, but that is young. Look at the ball pressure here from the rockets. It's much, much better than what we've been seeing. That's on air's bowl bowl with the follow. Now, Jabari on Alan. Oh, nice little quick spin baseline, but he blew the layup. He goes to basketball. He's over six. Wow. Durant to bowl bowl. Deflicted by Thompson. Knocked away and stolen by Holliday throw to a man. There you go. But again, it's the ball pressure inside of the rockets and... Locked from behind by a man who will leak out. And again, a man toxic. Give this show man his flowers. Alan over the shoulder to young. Missed the reverse layup. Lays it back out to Durant. Inside the bowl bowl is able to loop it over to Thomas should go for two. Rockets don't need to clean up the defensive glass. They're getting crushed. With offensive rebounding and second chance points by the Suns as Durant rings that end. Average of over 28. A game six best in the league and that scoring average is the highest of any player ever. And his 16th NBA season, with more from the Wayne Jodex. That's just good basketball. Full, full of the full fake good drive and the dunk. But he's easier coming off the bench since it's starting up in there. Faceline pull up, Booker over green. Seven straight for the Suns. And there he thought he should have gotten an end one but hit the shot there. So. Ordnable bowl. The eight down logo. This is Rockets can tie it up. Believe it or three. Here comes green driving on golden ties it up. Oh, you can stand it. Get stopped. No, you got there big. You got this. He's almost 90% aligned. Oh, nasty pullback green for three. Thank you. Two on Booker back to Jordan. Now to Alan over green got it off in time. Got time. And an Oklahoma City will be here on Sunday and in the Rockets will return the face up in OKC on Tuesday nights. Wide open, Durant, Drew too leaving you thanks open for the flush. Eric's for just two points from one to five shooting. Smith over to Rand. Three. And Durant got there and made it up here. He's got North Booker shooting it well there by nine to 27. He's in this game so far. One to seven. Green. All alone. A men top. He's got ten now. Five and six for a men. Yes, plays to his strengths. Durant again on the move gets to the cup. Stuff's it down. Durant's averaging almost six assists per game this year. Wide open Smith from the corner. Short. And picks up his own miss. The van Fleet for three. That is grand is on by yard. Sometimes you want to work your way in. You don't want to do too much. And you got to play and say, you don't forget this. Let me go take over. Durant turned around. Tested it all over. Top's breaking fence. Better offense. It's a good sequence though. It defensively you know that's the key place you're right. You live. This is on the offense. You'll face. This is where he can be attacked. Five and six for this game. Smith. Nope. Top's it. Offset. So rebound. Set up dribbles. And at one eight. The flush. So Eric is good as he was the last time in the year. He's been the opposite. Oh, you're a step off. He left no good. We've dealt by Smith that government. He's going. This was going to be rocket's turn. They're dying. We'll play center field on that possession. He's trying to keep the rockets away from the rim. And 16. Booker knocks it down. He's been shot there from Devon Woodbury. He's going to have to mock in on him with Kevin Durant on the bench. All that goes down. Perfect foul. But he shot there for Cam Whitmore. It's to lead home. Scores. The Suns for advantage. lead has 23. You lead Houston. Whitmore on the other side. The Suns were scared and looked like they're just getting out of the way. And in fourth quarters of games for a team that can really shoot. They can't shoot and they don't defend in fourth quarters. It's been a problem as Durant is able to score there. Now the Suns have been a bit better in fourth quarters this month. He's high. You got to go. And Durant's the kind of guy who could put up points in a hurry to start on the fourth quarter. The Suns is up to 21 now. And again, you can help off Daddy as you own the three point line or a cookie. Locked by a bowl bowl. It's a spider. Hard play has gotten into this ball game and competing. Don't leave him open. Racist, Alan. The best in the league from three. How about a mid Thompson blocking bowl bowl? Snip to green in the corner. Yeah. That started with the mid Thompson. Got to take it. Absolutely. I felt like he stepped in with confidence. And that's all you ask. KD from the mid range. KD with 24. He's no three and has four fouls. The job of their league fighting through that screen, leaving Dylan Brooks on KD. Big turnaround rise up score. KD taking over. One on three. Whitmore, quick three, up top. Barely hips to the ring. We're not put back. There you go. That's the difference. Rockets working the glass. Rockets defend the three so much better here at home. Defending generally so much better here at home. Bowl bowl looking for another one. Bowl bowl. It's time to game of 96. What a night. Very blind. It's 9 out of KD. It's out of foul circle. Inside of you, you can catch a man. Lean back to him. Shocked by one. He down to three. Rimsall went to bowl bowl. He drives and he scores. And he got fouled. Booker drives to kick. A bowl bowl. Fixed the three. Runs it up along the baseline. That is such a tough shot. That's out by Shindoon to Brooks. And it did make as well driving to the ring for Dylan Brooks. It's first field goal of the night. Tonight shooting the bowl. Thompson finds a melting smith. Over you, Biggs, the three. Yes. Big time shot at the top of the circle. Put your boys in the junior. Shindoon rolling on O'Neal. Into the lane. Nice patience. Block stays with it. Scores. There you go. It's come all there playing inside out. You got a good look. Allen to bowl bowl. Slip-æŒ–. Shindoon back in a game. And get a flippin' does. Scores the hoop. Draws the foul. And we'll shoot a free throw. The job here. Shindoon being up. Durant. Rapp around inside. Bowl bowl. Well done by Kevin Durant. I hope to take away the three. All the markets right now. Two doesn't beat you. This is the second Shindoon. Now the rebound blocks. Oh, rebound to greener now. Touch by. Oh, my God. Now, I'll be the foul here. Nope. Nothing's silly. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. There you go. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it.
