 and it's controlled by the basers. So you mentioned it. That was an opponent first quarter high at 16 buckets. The three-point percent is 71 percent. So let's see if the pebbles can slow them down to begin to hit them hard and almost give it away. Instead, it's going to freeze the ocumptor. It begins with a triple hit. So they've done it a high. All season long. It's a curve on the roll. He's got Z. Good decision. This is a great way to start. Right? 12 or 90 seconds in. Knees bit. Trying to stay in front of Z. Yeah, the only steps that are going to play. Just to see you notice, knock that shot. If they're going to play small ball like this. Now 17 or 12 as it goes inside the game. Now that was his MO coming in. The Anciones getting to it, getting with control. Second time. CJ. Right. That's what he didn't need that much time. No, I'm so much just gathered to roll. Take it to knock. Exactly. He heard the other way on the turnover. Can he Euros went home? That's beautiful. But in the thing that Rick Corlow talked about in the game. Now clear out. For Z. I think it's Miles Turner. He reads. He leaves it off mid-range. I love this. I love this. I love this. Don't assist the ultimate professional. Ultimate professional. Proud that Lucy is footing. And another mid-range. Okay. You can get to wherever you want to get to. To Turner. Or is that a full rotation in your kick and the onus out to the weak side of the floor? Bowser started the game nine for ten on the fallaway. I'm going to step through and stand. Beautiful work by Brandon England. Great footwork. Going anchor the pivot. Yeah, that's good. Stats it off. D-brain. And Euros is turning it out. You got a five on four basically. Z. Cherzy. Brandon launching. Got that, Trepple. Beautiful offense. Beautiful offense. Go to work. Go to work. Go to work. Brandon's tap. Go to work. Little longer than knee space. Here comes the double. Fallaway. Top shot. Go to work. What? Beyond Euronwell right now, Joe. He's over right now. If you know what, I'll live with that. I don't care what shot he takes. I'll live with it. And it's over, Siakum. Little bit short. Captain Light by Trepple. Great job. Go. Checking into the game. Gillon spent. He didn't even get a ladder. He just came in and let that joint go. Brandon. All the way to the home. Boy, he cook it. He cook it. And another time off for Riccala. Very nice junior into the game. But the first time Brandon was a repussy. I mean, it looks like it anyway. Boy, you are here too. You are here too. You are here too. You are here too. Boy, you are here too. You are here killing me, I. Nice about you, Jack. Brandon, go to the ball again. He just won't, you saw that coming. Jose Waddy, he won Brandon. Raise up. Raise up. It's got Mathura. Raise up. Big advantage size wise. And the fallaway is. Yes. You saw amazing. And the adjust on his way down. That was tough. So 40. And Macau gets it. That is such a game right there. Big advantage. Get two feet in the black. What you said earlier, don't check your foot up the gas. Because they are fully capable of scoring in huge punches. And we saw, oh, see. Oh, oh, oh. We saw the end of Pacers do the same thing. Right. But about five second difference between the shot block and the game block. Have you ever seen anybody win in Normals? Yes. Have you? Yeah. Oh, tray. Wide open. Three. Got it. And you know what? Good mood. Wait a minute. Hold on. Whatcha going to do is amazing. I'm going to draw and throw back even ups. Nobody wants you then left. That goes혱3. So medjust did that roll. It better. I can comefield this. It a tackle. Bring it back overalls and see in that basketball go through! Brandon, back on the floor. Evgencer OB is on. Did he say it? He said it. He said it. but dice it. Drew, it was me. He said it. a walker rather just jacked into the game to try and get to the loose stuff. Pull up, he's going to pull up for three. Pull up and Dan, incredible. McCom, on the trail, Matt McConnor. He does a great job and it's keeping his eyes up. He's not a sense it and it's a good look for top. It's a great job by Trey Bustman. It'll get the walker or check that Smith rather and it almost deflected away. That was a sensational shot. He was falling on a bounce, Smith for three. He'll get it. When T.J. McComnor was Steve Nash and that boy keeping it alive under the rim as dang home. Deep green. Time. Try to. Felt's in the lead by as many as 31. It's down to 17 on a nine nothing one. The cattle sets it off. Walker got there. And blew the layoff but not only enough. Turn him. Not G. Asick. He's got G on the run but you got to take it with you. Unforced air. Get turned over. Give it away. And nobody at home. Easy. Nobody at home. Time out, Pell's. You got a zone here. Who they miss? That's a great play by her. That's a great play by her, Jones. Brandon coming up. Doesn't have the numbers. It'll be C.J. for three. See how they miss Smith underneath. Nimhard back into the game. And the pass. Extra pass. Smith with the easy one. Two minutes remaining and the half. Pell's still shooting 64 percent. Mid range. Brandon. It's still there. You have to find the hot hand and ride that hot hand. Zone has not been great. Upper. Out of shore. And Brandon's got it. That was early. Tray running. Three ball. Yes. Speaking to going up early, Joe. Brandon down. With Tray. He wanted that match up right there. Great pass. Senator not beautifully. Tray. Bang! What a way to finish up. Incredible first pass. And rhythm dribble. C.J. You're right. That rhythm dribble. And that jab step. Put him right into rhythm. The boot team struggling right now. The offense. And the only bucket for Pell. C.J. is crippled. And a nice cross of a Brandon on the reverse. Going online. Incredible. Clone and Mercy. Brandon by the way. We talked about it at the top of the telecasts. Efficiency in Indiana. Mid range. Step through. Go to the left to the center. Everything else has worked. Brandon brings it double. Good pass. Her extra pass. And Jonas. Chapter A. Her back for it. Don't think about. Need her above the floor. Nehmer. He leaves it up. And Turner on the finish. Tray is catching Cheetah. Welcome back. Continues. Wow. She jammed the corner. As Zion. They're not rushing a thing. And they don't need to. Zion. The floater. And he gets the wall. I'm going really here. That's it. That's it. The heck of a lot of contact. They're just more active to the ball. Called it's 50-50. The log. Not exactly. Textbook. But a put back. Just the same five as Ed Johnson. He never meant to. The horse raises. You're putting it. You're putting it. You're putting it. You're putting it. You're putting it. You're putting it. You're putting it. You're putting it. You're putting it. And by the way, Jen, you are invited as well. It can dictate how well you are playing defensive.Good job hard. Set it up. That's right. And push it up. That's what we do. Or teams that are under crumbs. Matt and he got 76 were goeded out. No his will to L&B. Who's going to go out the bubble that wasCloth? Matthew. Here's Germany, Jason G理brook. That was Patrick Mum to Alex. Green take for the two points. This one was Jessica and John Itadick. This big five. This two points. Take good care of Patrick and Ben advantage on African American champs Matt very much when you do what it takes. Brandon against a good defender and is blocked by Johnson. The honest didn't break out. Water bottle got broke out. That was still shooting 59%. And we talked about how efficient they were at the art. 54% 13 to 24. It's a matter of time they get finger roll off the window. Train, skydazies and I with 28 points. And Hawke. Man, what a stroke. They got to ask him to ask. What a stroke. It's a bad. And a couple of misses inside. Not this time. Yes. Isaiah Jackson finally. The average on 24 game. That's number one. I in the lead. And the put back. Telling you man that you're a man of balance. So very successful one game. That's a long one. Oh, good to be here though. Yes, you do. Thank you. You're welcome. So I'm going to be back. Telling you man that you're a man of balance. Yeah. So very successful one game. That's a big one. That's a big one. That's a big one. Thank you.
