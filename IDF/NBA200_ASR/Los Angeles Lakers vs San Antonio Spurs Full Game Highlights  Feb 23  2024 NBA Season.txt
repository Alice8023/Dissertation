 You ready? You game? I'm game. All right, welcome back. Great looking. Downtown Los Angeles, Spurs and Lakers. Long shot long rebound tap by Victor Blotts by Victor. So that one coming. Victor's, yeah, foul on A.D. That's going to be for three, 30% of his points this month are coming from behind the arc. Three, lob there from all three to LKJ. Long lead, A.D.'s there again, ready, available and dunking. Victor had an opportunity, now Wembee-Gala rattles it in from downtown. It are. Nice trip to the rim. Wembee got it again, already putting on a show. Russell got it. Good answer right back. Champenny, so hands right there giving up to Wembenyama. Hatchamore steps right into that three in with it. So on the floor you've got James Davis, Russell, Rui Hatchamore and Austin Reed, same five that started the game. Spin, LeBron Buckhandlamps good. James, is that Collins in front of him? Well, well, B.J. Got it. Yes, sir. All hands taking away. LeBron with a chance to the break. Here comes Torian all the way. Outer good pass by James. That's about unsufficed throwing down A.D. Unsufficed by Torian. LeBron James, boy, had the defender right on his back, the lob in the jam. A.D. kind of it goes. It goes. You'll go to the line in shoe one. It's D.Angelo as the defender right on his hip. And he hits. You're going to see a little bit different kind of an offensive player that you're going up against. A.D. Though that time, peeped off the dribble by Jenny Osmond. Wembenyama, after the turnover, random goes right at Spencer in scores. Victor down the middle. He goes. Counted. He's back at it again. Wembenyama. And LeBron starts his quarter with the basket ball. It's about 10 feet away. There's that little step back to his and he scores with the soft touch. By the way, Lakers had a 21 to 2 run in that first quarter. That followed up at 90s Spurs run. Underneath. Random lays it up and in. Nobody home defensively. As Jackson has little roundhouse going to the other side of the rim. And the Lakers starting a stretch of 8 out of 9 at home. Can extend that nearly to the end of March. Nothing but net by Wesley. B.A.S. LeBron. 18 footer. LeBron James. James. Shulves are right over to D.Angelo. Got it. Yes, sir. Lakers, little lookaway pass goes to Rui. Who is aggressive and goes to the other side of the rim. Now LeBron looks around again. So much fun with those lookaway passes. Fresh snow. And it's down to the bottle of the L for D.Angelo. Anneasus from LeBron. Timeout. Collins looks to go in and he does. He goes up and under and scores. Reeves leans in. That's a shot that is very reliable for him. Not that time, however. Davis mid-range magic. They work a little wee about on top. That's a pretty good ball movement and dribbling and passing and scoring. Spurs. 28th on offense. Not a good offensive team. Oh! Spin it up and in. I took more. Long lead. Great, Rui there. Oh, a block in a wedgie. How about a block in a wedgie? Oh, here's a tap to Reeves perfectly done. Here comes Jones in amongst the trees, Kelvin Johnson counted. And one. You know, they're struggling. I mean, they're 196 winning percentage. It would be an all-time low for them as AR knocks down another triple. Lakers are back up to a 56-47 lead. What a move by Davis to finish. Can we please shout out the Lakers not playing tonight? Vanderbilt, Reddish, Vincent, Christian Wood. Another one from downtown. Rui Hatchimora. Automatic. That's a good glide and score by Solvang. It's underneath. Rui Hatchimora. Oh, blocked. Block was by Vicell. Six to shoot. Weekside rebound and follow by Anthony Davis. You know what a great offensive rebounder he is. Vicell. Jones. So hot. Look out. It's a conflict. On the break. Wembynama. That's good pass. Good pass. And the soft throw down by Solhan. Lakers starting front line shot. 68% 17 to 25. LeBron settles in for three. I just think from an energy standpoint. Showing what you're capable of. Kind of an uptick on both sides of the basketball. And D-Lowboy. And that smooth. Smooth. You talked about talking to him. Oh, Solhan. Big time. As he came down the middle in a nice delivery by Shem Penny. It's just been a different combination of all season long. Trying to figure out just with who the guys they have fit for this season. But the progression never stops. So the willingness to want to continue to learn and get better despite only winning 11 games. Jones. He attacks underneath. So the smallest guy on the floor scores. You've only had one lead change in the game. Bring it up for Brun. Victor launches three. Wembynama. A.D. back and in on Wembynama. Goes over that lawn arm and scores. Having his best shooting month of the year. Bruni. Boy, switches it right through. Wembynama. Wide open in the corner. Set. Fire. Get. That's Tray Jones. D-Low. Once again. Thou snows to the south. Looses it. Get both from behind. Bruni's on his horse. Oh, gets it right back from Brun. Goes to the other side. And scores on a pretty fast break. And rebound. Lakers had it for a minute. And they knocked it down with Vassal. A.D. hang in the air and score. If Vassal tried to slip the defense, Collins playing a little more confidence right now. He scores in the lane. And again, the bench continues to struggle as a unit. It's a three point game. Open his reeds on its way. Perfect. There is a jetty osman. Bruni. From distance. That's the way to start. If you're a spur. Grisky. Two big steps. Left hand is good. The brawn with a strong dribble. And a little ten footer is good. And he raises both his hands coming back. There's the cut. Oh! Bruni throws it down with the left hand. With those of two high school mates right there. He's not saying visits. He's not saying a former high schooler. There goes Jack. On its way. Torian. Torian prints. Another three. A lot of guys have to do that with Victor. Here's Lebron hanging in the air, drifting left, shooting right. Solhan wants to get in very deep over Lebron. And scores. That's where I get angry. Hey! Don't get angry there! Love that one by Jackson Hayes. Up ahead Lebron. He's one on four. And now he's one on one. Out on an island with Solhan and Nann. Down to 13 with two 20-9 runs. Right over a Mammu. Boy Johnson having his way. So there you go. Don't want figures now. Five out of six. Johnson hold nond to it. Corner. Three. Malacca. Ten point game. Minute to play. There's some interest of what is going on down the stretch. As Johnson hits. Yeah, they're not playing the foul game. And finishing up. Put a bow on it. Jackson Hayes. With four. With three Collins. Or wrap up. They're shooting attempts for the night.
