 You ready? You game? I'm game. We're used against the box. At least gentlemen are going to get an opportunity to show. As Dave will, it's starting out showing us that he... ...is on fire from the beginning. Dave had a massive game the last time these two teams met. As Avietsu Zubat continues to deliver, he was 7-9 years today. It's the first bucket for the clippers. How about Zoo from the dotted line? Back to back buckets for Avietsu Zubat. Now Yannis late in the clock. Beasley in the corner for three. It's a win. That's how I remember Beasley in the NBA. One night he might be knocked at the L5 out of 6. The next is James Hart. The floater and one coming up. Well, for the press at James Hart, he is my favorite James Hart. And how about that? Harden out with 6. Yannis had space to shoot. Just enough to Damon. Now here's the thick and roll. Anytime he's in the paint, he is lethal. Exhibit A. He is just that good. A toe in the paint, he's going to score. They found out those coaches that Yannis is too strong to power forward. As a mere coffee and you call for it, that a mere is going to start knocking them down today. Real by 20 and Custon, trail by 14 yesterday. To the polls, as Yannis knocks down the mid-range shot, cussily down to three. Liller, tough three for some. That was not an easy shot, he just made. Beasley with five to shoot. Great defense by Tucker. They throw it into the full pass. He can't hold on to it. Here comes coffee. Went Liller to beat Tuna Rae manana. 14 on the shot clock for Norman Powell also in to rain. The fray. There is an overall in the NBA. And this is no sweat, no shoot. He didn't look that challenging. I promise you, that's one of the harder shots that Norman Powell has had to make. And I'm tired of this already. Or for four. He has Damien Liller from the field and all of them are threes. He has a game high 12. The third time, not the charm. Big defense there by Lopez. And now here comes Pat Beverly the other way against coffee. Oh, Boston says try next time. What a block by Boston. He's defensive by coffee. Interception by Powell. Clippers run the power play. Powell calls his own number to the rim and in. Strong finish by Powell cussily down to one. Bones made all three of his shots. Yes, the excellent hustle by Tyson. Can Boston find a dirty can? And the Clippers put 30 on the board in the first quarter. What is locked by Tucker? A whistle at a foul. Tucker saying review it. It's illegal play. The ball is then knocked out of bound by four. So it will be reported to the Clippers. Don't retain their time out and be rewarded the ball. Bones highland for a deep three. Okay. 33 26 Clippers. Yannis. Place back to Connitent for the catch in shoe three. It is good. Those help defenders for the Clippers are keeping Yannis off balance. Yannis gets down hill and side. However, it is a different story. Bones in the corner. Three to shoot. Is he aware? Side step three. Block by Connitent. Great play defensively. Although Bones really did not have a lot of options there. Highland deep inside off the window and in. And Bones highland now with five off the bench. And then he's going to be able to pass and cut and pass. So simple. This is where Yannis is just. He's a literally unstoppable. I would imagine. Five to shoot from Beverly. Beverly for three. It's good. It's an underrated part of his game. He's always been very efficient. Highland. Five to shoot. In trouble. In jail. No chance of parole. Seven to shoot for coffee. Picked up by Yannis. Steps into a three. Oh, he banks it in. And cold glass just high-flying. Let it go. Beasley in the corner for three. It's good. Back and forth we go. While the percentages are not very high. We're seeing some shot making here in downtown. This feels like it flushes it down. transition defense. We hear Ty talk about all the time. Oh, don't hide in the flush. Hoppe on the move. Rock around the zoo. Oh, and Avita Zuba to whirling dervish inside Lee. And then he's going to be able to get the shot. And then he's going to be able to get the shot. And then he's going to be able to get the shot. Whirling dervish inside. Lee's it in again. Mortis again from above the nail. And again that knocks it down. He is a big time player for the Bucks. A huge reason why they won the championship. They're stopped the ball. But they don't get the ball out of Yannis's hands. He attacks. And Yannis puts the Bucks now out in front. 56 to 53. Hard. It's good. Hard now with 10. Here is Ty's on the short call. The leader is good. It's tied up at 57. Defluxed in reception. Arking pass to Highland behind the defense. And he lays it in. 62-57. The Clippers for what is available have pitched a near perfect game here in the first half. Heads of Beasley. Challenge nicely by coffee. What a finish by Beasley. Coffee for 10. No. A choppy start to this second half. And I do not like it. And neither does Ty Lou. A very nice start for the Bucks. A mirror. White balls went into Plumley. Man inside and he lays it in. First pluck into the second half for the Clippers. Lob to Lopez. A tough pass. A tough catch. And a nice shot there by Brooklyn Lopez. Tough shot for Powell. Tough for some people. Powell knocks it down. He's got to win. Yannis. And Yannis now with 19 on six of 13 shooting. Bucksley by one. Giant strike. Down the lane. Blocked from behind. Recovered by man. Router in the corner for three. He's good. Coffee. Terrence alone on the wing for three. Blocked for Terrence. Man he's got 13. Little duped. Get deep inside of his layup. He struggles around the rim. But a clever move there for Lillard. Only on the rim. The finish. Style points might be locking. But it still counts for two. It went through the third Lillard. The Lob to Yannis. He makes the grab counted out of foul. Lillard is clever. Exhibit A, your honor. Lillard lays him in. 15 seconds of the shot clock for the clippers. Down the time out. Plumley. Minds. Powell in the corner for three. Oh, it's good. 80 to 79. Norman Powell with 15 points in 14 minutes. But there's got to get back. Yannis. Underneath to fuck it and lays it in. You saw it on my other way. Man, let's step back three. Lillard chases down the loose pole. Challenging the ball. Harkness transition lays it up in. And Dami and Lillard now with 19. Position inside for the Bucks. Arkey passed down for the crowd. We have seen this a few times. The clippers over the last few weeks getting burnt in transition. Just like that. Island inside. About Powell for three. Oh, it's good. And this just him. So is Norman Powell. He's got 18. And the clippers cut the lead to five. And the clippers cut the lead to five. And his power drivel at least it in. Boston gets around. Yannis, oh my goodness. Powell, nasty. Boston looked to finish. Yannis. Latt from behind was that by Boston. It's recovered by the clippers. How old? Feels the cost. I counted on a foul. And sent that young man to the line. The rebound nearly some friendly fire. Powell rescues it. Challenging in. And all the floater in transition is good. Counted on a foul. Well, it passed into Tucker. He lays it in. We are tied with 10 minutes to play. Time out Milwaukee. Cooper's out the last eight of the game. Beasley is sidestepped three. It's a big one. And if puts Milwaukee out of front 96 to 93. Island accelerates down the lane. Uncensored to the Coppen. Island. A deep three. Bucket. Clippers out in front by two. Great screen by Lillard. Kennedy easy. Bucket there for Yannis. Tough shot by Yannis. And it goes. He's got 29 back-to-back buckets. Lillard for the triple. It's a big one. 103-98 timeout clippers. Bucket passed to Zouge. Orgle leader has gone. Oh my goodness. Man was riding shotgun that give to Zouge. New muscles is way to the rim. Oh my goodness. Afeet to Zouge. Briggs and Clippers two within one. In the mid-range. Big bucket for Yannis. 31. Zouge. 107-102. Clippers get it. Coffee in the corner. Nax it down. It's a two-point game. Lopez a deep three. Oh my goodness. A colossal triple. Find Zouge. All the touch. It's a three-point game. Timeout bucks. Big freeze for Lillard all the way. Six triples for Lillard today. Heart the step back. It's going by seven. Lillard for three. Bucks by ten. And Damien Lillard doing. Damien Lillard type things. Howl inside. And he lays it in. Coming. Howl with 26. Coffee for three. It's good. A beer coffee with 16. Man for three. We've seen crazy things happen. It's a four-point game. The Bucks win. They snap a two-game slide. And the Clippers fall. 124. The Bucks win. The Bucks win. The Bucks win. The Bucks win. The Bucks win. The Bucks win. The Bucks win. The Bucks win. The Bucks win. The Bucks win. The Bucks win. The Bucks win. The Bucks win. The Bucks win. The Bucks win. The Bucks win. The Bucks win. The Bucks win. The Bucks win. The Bucks win.
