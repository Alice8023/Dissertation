 You ready? You game? I'm game. I got away with Sean Elliott, Nate Ryan in the crew. I'm Dan Wys. Thanks for joining us here. Back into the front court. Shane Green is not going to be bashful. Talked about the amount of shots and they're going to ride over the top of the court during these three-four-three. Victor into the corner. Another three for trade. And that one's good. Trade for trade. 18 minutes got to continue to keep the defense honest. Be one defender. 42nd three on the season for trade. Jones, Jalen Green, step back, jumper skin. And it's a score. No question about it. And the set will trigger it on the side. Trade Jones. You're the floater around the base line over the van bleed. Oh, no, that's dark for trade. Runner's flash floater along the baseline. And then it comes away with the steal. Brushes off, van bleed. Ways it up in a timeout. You may not open. It's going to let him go here. Which is a bold strategy considering the spurs and the best three-point shooting team for centralize. Head to the all-star pre-alpha break right. Dylan Brooks with the jumper for his first bucket. 5% out of the all-star break from downtown. Even though they cooled off last night. Still shot 38%. Let's pick the win, Minyama on the line for trade. Jones. It's always there. Landel, looking for help. Here's Brooks, season of Jalen Green. Dylan Brooks is going off the window. T-pal, the spurs, here. Rockets for the fresh 14. Landel. And that one, you roll in for Jalen. And the spurs come away. They've got numbers coming up before. Jalen got to be able to save that from being a turnover. And Jeremy Sohan, the key from Blake Weston. Jeremy's been moved back to that natural position. He does great job moving out the ball. And finding open lanes to the basket. It's been the recipient of a lot of passage where he makes great cuts. Thanks, one of them. Victor, falling away throws it away. Look, team's looking for a way to get the ball. The way throws it away. Look, team's a lot of sorts to start here. The second holiday. The way it up and in. Extra possessions for the Rockets. Reggie Bork with him is. The Rockets just killing the spurs on the line. They're getting three or four shots every time down the floor. Fortunately, the Rockets only have five points themselves. Jeff Green. Cox down the three. And the Rockets have got the lead. Victor, again, the swarming defense back to trade. He's got a fire, pulls the trigger. Come here. Trace jude. 15 first half points. Trapped in the corners to Montaig Ram. Over the creates some space. Four seconds to shoot though. Mamo. That pulled the trigger. Mamo gets it off. Put it in. He saw Trace Jackson Davis against Victor last night after the fact was very classy and his response. Says, no, what? Everything gets dunked on. He's just got a part of the game. Absolutely. I've seen all my big fellas. Just like a cornerback in the NFL and a receiver. Sometimes receivers are going to get shut down and sometimes they're going to burn. They're going to cornerback for a touchdown. Final minute here. The opening half. 3-3 is good. 3-3. That's a last first half out. That's what you want out of your point guard right? You want a guy who is going to be an opportunistic score like right there. Fall comes out of the low block. It makes a nice fit. Going to baseline finds the middle of the paint wide open. You've used the glass. He's up to 20 and really just taking one to. Might get a bunch of speedy tickets. He's going to get a... Pick up the rest of those shots. The South. High-spinning trade Jones plays it up in a... Whips it into trade Jones. He's trapped under eaves. Back out top, Champaigney for three. Got it. Julian Champaign. Six to shoot for Van Blee. Two, one Van Blee puts it up. Puts it in. That was a little class. What do you get some of the shot for the Rockets who lead it by three? Farie Smith Jr. has the mismatch. Pulls up over trade Jones. Come on, play there. Turn away. Way from the W. Who's done a great job sticking to the game plan? Going to shoot for Jeremy Gozaffman. Get's the friendly roll. Gozaffman. Gozaffman. Gozaffman. Jeremy will launch for three. Get it. Jeremy hits the strings. There he goes. Good confidence shot. Devin Gussell is going to play a night for him tonight. Back out to Jeremy. He'll get another one from downtown to Jeremy. He hits it again. He's got the last 10 to the spurs. A lot of time in the gym this summer working on it again. Alakai Brandon Blake Wesley in the game is Jalen Green gets to the hole for an amateur. Jalen Green gets to the hole for an amateur. What opportunity? Man, Blake. Uslin down in the paint blue. The lap to Barry Smith Jr. is there. Put it off the glass and gets the roll. All right. Too many guys on the corner at the time. Take coming away with the block there. Alakai Brandon Wesley attacking. Put it up with the left hand. Nice check by Blake Wesley. He uses body. Rockets a four point edge here. Getting into the final minute of a third. Wesley spots a momo when he gets the roll. Barry Smith Jr. sets the screen here. Her and holiday pulls up over momo for two. I have a holiday brothers can go. Sean Elliott made Ryan and approved end-wise from the fall spank center. Victor Wendon Yama turning to the inside and puts it down for two. Just there's seven three pointer. Blake Wesley with a miss underneath that balls on the deck. Momo scoops it up. Fines Wesley. Good hands there for momo. Malakai for three. Who struck momo's there again. Malakai Brandon for two. Turn now, Rockets. Come on the effort and hustle for momo. Shampeading. The inside now spitting around. Jalen Green Momo there again. But she back up and in. Six points. Five rebounds for momo.

Clean look at the three. Momo with the rollerfollow up on the glass. Fifth assist for trade. Momo's got eight off the bench. Jack Lander with the dunk. Jalen Green. Momo's got two big dons on the rope. Into the hands of Javari Smith Jr. He's at up the floor himself. Posed up right at the foul line in scores. So, Hamilton, trigger the inbound. Here's seven scene on the shot clock for the spurs. Locks it up looking for Vector Gets a drink on the Victor's scores. And one. And Jerry trying to beat him over the top of the screen. He goes left off of it instead. And draws a foul. That's two wide open. Breakdown defensively. And Javari Smith. It's third block of the night. Oh, behind Shampeading goes back. He gets it. The sound. Get it. Dylan hits the strings. Four point game. Great Jones back to Victor when Midiava betrayed. No. Jeremy's so in the rebound. Goes back up to the right and scores. And he's found. As he's triggering the inbound, that's the vanway got a foul. That is Hans Holliday. And Holliday's foul with 4.1 to play. This is what you're counting on.
