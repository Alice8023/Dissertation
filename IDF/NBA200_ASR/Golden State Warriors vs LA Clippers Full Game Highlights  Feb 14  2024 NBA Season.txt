 Final time this year. And the Warriors would like to even up that season series. But there is no quiet letter tonight. His heart opens up the scoring, quiet with a doctor strain. Ramon opens with the three. He likes knocking him down early. It gets me to talk to about his defense. Comes up with a loose ball. Come in, guy. Look out. He gets a run away. The beard. I tell you what, he starts to look at his three-point shooting at 42%. And then all the creativity, Clay, up the main basket, just walked into a layup. They're throwing it ahead. And took a lot of steps in the layup there. But they were small steps. And then he got it to Zubox. And with a ragged beginning both ways. And Steph Curry can change that real quick with a three. See Zubox, Deer and Dremont hit that. Dremont's been scoring. And double figures. As Paul George hits the wing jumper. That is a great matchup. The former AAU teammates. Steph Curry. Curry goes right around. Zubox goes right to the rim. And that's the last, but coming out will finish. EG13. Paul George. Oh man. Smooth. Mr. Plumley is in a 7GP2. Little big man. Right down the lane. EG13 nearly half his shots are three. You see an average of 22 a game and 40% on three. Pass was low. Didn't buy the wings at all. As he hits the three. The Warriors are five of eight free throwing. So they're leaving a few at the line here in the Westbrook. We'll get inside. Flip it in and draw a foul. Come in, go. On the kickout. The Gypski on the counter attack. Flip it up and in. Here's come in, go on high. You post him up. Plumley's there on the turn around. And J.K. Rinden home anyway. Shot clock at seven. Hardens like our. It's Shar just switched on to me. Let me ice out. I want three scoring titles. And gold tented is come in. The way up. The clippers are not going to stop scoring. That's why they're 27 and seven. They're last 34 games. But Gypski for three. The main game side. There is your threatening move. You got a small defender. Norman Powell can't hold you. To get stout, he'll like that. The beer is so clever and so strong. She bots a sick type zone. Warriors have seen that. Man finishes. And Steve Kerg and it's taking time out right away. Everybody's kind of hard to play. For Gypski, two threes and you talk two more tonight. Powell runs it back so the clippers are like, all right, we'll run it back on a made bucket too. They're ninth in transition for Sharix. Warriors shot three so well all year. They need to have to come back. Step Kari, dropping it in second three. There he is. Powell got it, step a lot. Nirmek Toronto warrior final. Particularly with the ramp. Me and that one. Kari went around and we got to the baseline. Hardly made. He's got that threes as locked. That type of Gypski, that type of play. And then Brandon leaking out. We only let him in. Just fubs up to all the women of the trend setters. I worked with Kate Scott, WCC. They might have sent that screen. They Curry, they read it and they make it hard. But Tramon does that so well. Tramon knocked it away. So you get from Westbrook three on two. Tramon grand. It's step three. Paul George is so worried about step Kari. Give the ball a shoot of three. He didn't pick up Tramon green. Curry in the tree. He's got a team. Hard and great block. Hard and from deep. That's a big make. Keep that going here. The clip was not been as efficient as they would like. All George scoring right off the bat. Wiggins right on cue. It's a three. Two bots. The clear side. Let the big man roll. And he just larger the Dremont. Oh, too hard. That's fantastic. He will draw the foul flip that in. But Wiggins played him very well to the very end. And that's step. You got to do this too. It's going to be a way. The big guy is going to dunk it down. Dremont still is in the lane. So he's going to do it. He's got to foul somebody. He's got to foul. You're playing five on four. Now the words are use the time out. The air kind of went out of the deal with the Dremont last. Two bots. So he said double figures in every meeting against the Warriors. All four times. He's got 11 to 9. And hard and you couldn't catch it. Curry, relocate three. Curry, relocate three. Curry, but again took a bomb. But it's finished. And it'll come on. And so he was actually boxing out James Harden to get the rebound. Oh, well George, laying it up and in. Clippers are going to come alive from three. It's hard and hard. They're first three of the third. They were two or seven in the first. Two of nine in the second. But Jameski, you're in it. The body. The free throw. And Pops another three. Four for four on three. 18 of the game. Paul hitting a three. We just said the Clippers are not going to stay silent from distance all night. Staff missed. Rudy got it. And then Peyton tracks it down. Curry. There's history. No one's ever paid. Seven more threes in four straight games. And the entire NBA animals played missing. Rudy. Everang. I want to ricochet off, Dreowom. Moody couple of puffings in the finish. How about Moses Moody with six off the bench? They winged up her. Good sign. And then Moody with the steal. He's got Potschekki's drinking. Kamenja finds him. The step through the touchdown. That's it. Finishing IQ. Two seconds to work with. Man's got a good look at the three to end the corner and he got it. Three. They top three. Got it. And Ty lose. Like, give me Harden. Give me Paul George. Give me Westbrook. And all my eight, you know, the elite players in together. Westbrook scoring there. Dream on got down there. But Westbrook just avoided him. One extra dribble. They top said Midrange. Three. Midrange. Oh, Westbrook flies in. To Hammer home the Miss free throw. Manga did well to Charles George trying to take over. Howell floats it up and out. To Westbrook, the offense rebounder. That is a new stage of his career. While George coming up with the defense. And now he does not want that. That would excuse me foul. Paul George skip pass. Howell for three. And he got it. You know what, and set that up was Russell Westbrook's cut in there. And then he got a hand off the light. And he used step as a decoy. Paul George cut back door. And scored over Kamehki. He got to keep your discipline there. Harden to save the turnover. And just turned it long to three. Westbrook another offense rebound. And Zubox plays it off for one time. That's how Russell Westbrook impacts winning. The fans of all got to go in the basket. Howell hits a three. And this is not the clippers largest lead. But Jeppski on the baseline. And that was a big shot right there. Step from Greybond. Turn it over. Wiggins knocked it away. Warriors get it back. Curry open three. And they six to shoot. But Jeppski to a cutting train on the line in. Will present that 17 to run. They took the lead. Warriors have retaken advantage. Westbrook inside. Nice feet from Zubox. Paul George a nine time all star. These guys have been coppers so much in the NBA. Paul corner three. And he gives the clippers a lead. Harden three point lead to the ball. Howell. He's having them the fourth quarter. Barries is four three. Step trying to create some content. Created a basket and got 36. Westbrook getting a running start. Oh, a mere coffee. Barries a three. The best three point shoot and team in the NBA. Turn it to the way. Opportunity to run. Step brings to the three point line. Got it. Well, that is massive. Here's coffee. Trying to get down. He'll you will lay it up and out. But it'll draw the foul. Good shooting game. Good go. Procedede wise. They also outscore the Warriors by 12 from the free throw line. Raybott fighting. Pigeon corner three. Got it. Or you need a score. Stop score. There's one. He points the need to win a hurry. Curry. He'll flip it up and in. He's got 41. Okay. And we'll do it. So the clippers. They may be the best team in the West. Thanks for watching.
