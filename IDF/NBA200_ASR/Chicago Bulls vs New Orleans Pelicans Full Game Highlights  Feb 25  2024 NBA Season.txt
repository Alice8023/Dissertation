 You ready? You game? I'm game. So let's see if the Pell's imposed their presence at home. That is going to be the key as it's controlled by the Bulls. Be a symbol. Shooked off. Taken away. Brandon started. Brandon up against the bar. All the way to the cup. The legs look good, Erwin, Joe. Miniser there. Right, the minutes are there. The reps are there. Good set. Get the tray going. What in the gold? Get tray going. The Rousseau's got it. But if he points again off the turnover. Kobe White blocked away by a curve. That's a foul. Kobe White too. He's held him down. That's her upsteal because he actually calls the skill. Right. Both talks in early. And Hawks got a good look. Get the tray going. One of the things that Coach Billy Donovan has done this year. He's played Buzubish alongside Andre Drummond. A good amount and plays sort of a twin tower. And another turnover with the Pell's. On the run. Spacing his disoom over. And a triple off the turnover. The run is now 15 to nothing. He's shooting a career high from three. And a rollercoaster up his first goal. You got to keep your hands out of there and stay down. Keep your hands out and stay down. Exactly. He's going to the line. You can be because of the flow. You have to know who you're guarding. Rousseau, look at his feet well. See on the flip. And he's going to the line. And you know, I like him in the middle of the floor. This is where you want to get him. Up against erosion. Right. This is where you want to get him to basketball. That's why. Corner three. That's why. You get him to bowl in the box or getting the ball right in the center. You get him off the side, which they should. And he shares it. Straight back in. And extra pass. How about a finger roll? Extra pass. How fast can ball at all? I like this. Now you take the time. Right. Now you take the time. You pushed. There was nothing there. Now you can attack. Brandon, on the way to the hole. Right. You pushed. There's nothing there. Now Rousseau. Larry Gaines threw the striving and tied it 49. Off by a screen to symbol. The girls in thought about it. Up against Zion. And hard to the hole. When you're Zion, you have to close up. Now Zion. Brandon's got the size. And goes right by a hard to the hole. When Zion catches that ball right there in a minute or two. He's going to the hole. WI would go to Mitch's mid-range. And another easy one. It's up to Gondow. It's up to Gondow. The hell is 47%. You can see what the ball's game plan is. It's the pressure to basketball. Nice. And that's what you feel of pressure. Don't play with it. Beat it. Right. Beat it. Z sets it up. Clean look out front. Trey for three. Yes. Perfection. Brandon's got the Rosen. Set it up for her. Corner three. Too strong. But a back tap. And Z gets high. That's right. Right start to the second hand here. Brandon passes you the D3. And it'll be picked up by Kobe White on the run. Dissumble. You'll get the left. Blacks away. He won't get the layup. What time you buy Brandon and he will be. Kobe White with Nick Boosterbitch. And the layup. Garuso. And the space it has the triple. He can do that. And he's going to be able to do that. And he's going to be able to do that. And Bat Brandon's right pass Brandon in beautiful driving right pass right pass a drive of the kick Brandon Emmerung's got his fourth assist. Let me atop of the shot clock. If we mad live who just checked into the game of the dribbles and it's rough. Oh man like Jiren Collins said the Janet half time. Go check it. Let me atop of the shot. Black for him. And gets the little one. So you all those years in Orlando before coming to Chicago. Park off the window. Got it again. Is come on really a rookie. Tells by a dozen again. Boots of edge. There he's after it. Hold Nick Boots of the Jeremiah. Good luck. And that's a dangerous. Saw that. Really dangerous. Saw that coming didn't we long diagonal. Yeah. Right now by Chicago and the sumo. I think the sumo played very well. He's fast. He's played very well. But it being fast and being in control. He will be coach image, but it's taken away from behind. That's Terry. He's going hard. Locked away. Jeremiah. Other end of the floor. Brandon England. I've against him on the road. Carter on the run out. Midrange. Anyhow happens when you allow a team to stand in the game because you're turning to back. There's trade now as he's kept matching his career high. In the rebound. The matter I am midrange this time. OK. He goes back on top. I'm telling you if I'm a guard and I'm playing with Zion, you have too concerned with his ability to roll. Welcome to top. He'll be drumming. He blows it, but he's going to get it right back to the layup. So no match up. Be massive individual down to the box. Zion going right by Caruso and all the way to the hall. A leave for the Pell. Zined up to 15 and 10. He should be a 20 and 10 game for C. Wow. Kobe White. That was a nice crossover. And of course, Chicago's going to welcome that opportunity. Gorozin with Caruso. Gifts a wall. Three-point lead Chicago time out Pell. Gorozin. All over. And they're not giving him anything. It'll be tapped around and back in. Notice. He's only taking one free throw tonight as much as he's touched it. He's got 15 and 10 dimes with seven boards. It'll be Gorozin on the reverse. You're doing a great job at playing up that Dumbler's Barbarian Guard position. But when you're short guards, that's how you do it. You got it. This is what you get. Kobe White. And he got it in. Hard to believe with no contact they said. He sets it for D'Soumo who lost the handle. But it goes right to Terry. Every loose ball as Drummond goes to the line in the foul. Drummond got the contact reversed it home and goes to the free throw. And a game of the first half, when they were up by 10. He was led by three and a half. It'll be heard about a beautiful pass. Robinson Earl corner three. He's got the confidence. There's no question. Look at the Subaru right now on on on on. Brandon. Oh, I'm going to be out. Good set up. Her corner three. Got it. 3.0 game. Clutch. 16 triple to the night for the pals. Have to. Kobe White. Man, it's just you move. Didn't get him. And nobody in panic for Kobe White. Nobody. In. The ball in the three. And now the others. Follow it. Got it. 3.0 game. And it's out of four to. They're a physicality. One in on the ball. The pales have to match it. Debar de Rosa. Track by a home now. And to sumo three. Got it. Not back raker. Three and a half to play. They're up by two scores. To sumo with his third triple, 21 points. On an efficient eight of 14. G gets there. Go to the line. And his spot in the mid-range. And he got to reach out. That's going to count. Yeah, that's going to count. In continuation. Trace trying to get there. G's got under the post now. And three and a half to go. Again, Joe, this is what I said earlier. That's the best place for Zion. De Rosa's going to be their catalyst. He's got a great on a switch. And he shares it. Kobe White. He gets in on his dribble. Do you want to stay away from switching that though? But it all came from the switch. Brand is mid-range game. Coming up. Shoring. And Yolus for it. He gets it. Two point, 50 seconds to play. Give it a home. Yolus can't collect it. Blocked away. But De Rosa gets it back. It'll be a three for De Rosa. And he parries it. Kills the pebbles when they add up. You'll be Brandon Ingram. 50, 50 picked up by White. And that'll do it. And Chicago gets a huge road win at the...
