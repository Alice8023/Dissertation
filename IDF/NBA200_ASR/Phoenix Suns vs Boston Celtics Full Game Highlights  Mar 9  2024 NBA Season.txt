 You ready? You game? I'm game. My bad moves are time. Presented by Wingstop. The rat gets a nice friendly bounce, gets his first bucket. His orphan misses, Derek White. The rebound fights Tatum cutting to the basket in the lane. Good night James William Sean Corbin, Brent Barnicky. She was a knurkage, throws it up and in. Stolen by Brown. I don't think he's going to miss this one. That has been a big time issue for the Spinax Sunsteen. They're 26th in the NBA. In turnovers of Grayson Allen quickly scores down the other end. Jalen Brown. It was magnificent in that lost to Denver at 41. And he's already off to a good start here. Playing like an all-in-b-a type player like we've seen in the past. Speaking of all-in-b-a type players, Durant with four. Derek White, nice shot. Was defended well, still put it in. Brown. Trying to stay with knurkage just overpowers. Brown's one strong dude, but knurkage's just too big there. Bradley Hill with the connection from three-point range. And the Phoenix goes up one. Well, I think what's interesting is Kevin Durant as he shoots right over Derek White on a tough contestant. White scoop lay up. Lies it up and in. White gets inside. Beautiful look for Kornet. Brown, nice sidestep. Gets inside and backs that one home. Nurkage. Powers in, backs at home. Just overpowers Horford. Tatum lobs it up. White fakes. Another White pass inside the Kornet. He throws it down. Durant leans in. Rattles out one more. Nice cross-open from Britschord. Gets inside and backs at home. Shot clock at eight. Nice cross-over pull-up jumper. Tatum backs good. Second field goal for Tatum. Durant, baseline. Shot is good. Tatum step back hand of the space. It's got a taste of Tatum from downtown. Savin Lee, blocked by Holliday. Now the shot clock has turned off. Bulbul in the game launches a three-pointer. That's good. When he even gets up to check in, the crowd gets fired up. Holliday, no hesitation hits the three-pointer. So it looks back up by five. Bradley Ville. Here's second field goal. Little hesitation, Holliday and Kornet. Pritschord trying to take the big man off the dribble. Gets inside and backs at home. How about that from Pritschord? All the floated. Nice soft touch, Doris. Mike, there's never been a doubt about the Schungman's offensive skill. He's really talented. House of free. And a quick time out from Frank Vogel. Did not like House of being that open. The field puts it up and in. Bradley Ville now with nine points. Cross over Brown. Holliday, the fake backup top. Straight on three-pointer. Jalen Brown from downtown. Jalen Brown switches back shot. It's care of 13 points for Jalen Brown. Heal sidestep Brown. Racing up the floor, kicks it out on yield. Bulbul up and under. Going some flexibility there. Bulbul with a beautiful shot. There's Grayson Allen. The rotation get in. The pan, nice move again. That's a couple of those. He's second field goal. Pritschord. Corner three rattles around. That one goes through. Come on. Lead up to 12. The rant against Brown. Jump shot is good. And Brown right with it. As Horper throws it up. He has come such a long way on that. Oh, white with the left hand tips it in. And this now the largest lead of the first half. Beale hits a three. Nice pass ahead. And on yield shot blocked by white. Brown goes right out. Beale and scores easily. White. He's a defensive star. And he plays so aggressively. And as Brown knocks down the three. And lead up to 15. The rant drives on. Horper gets inside. Lays it up and in. 17 for Kevin Durant. New holiday. Goes that on the yogurt defense from Royce O'Neal. Oh, fake left hand. It's scoops shot. It's good. How about that magic from through holiday? Durant. Count it and the foul. Horper got a piece of it. And Durant a chance for a three point play. All right, Lisa Frank's logo playing against the Boston Sumpix. He was. Beale hits that. Then he worked for back in the late 90s. He did everything himself. Looked at film. Sisted coach. Tate's ankles. Durant knocks it down. Little different than today's NBA. Tate knocks down a three. And listen, we all understand talent is the number one key for a coach. Is Beale knocks down a three. Horper drives down a lane. How about out. Horper off the bounce. He heard his finger on the dunk. White throws it up. Horper throws it down. Eric White with his seventh assist. Oh, nice goal for Bradley Peel. 19 for Beale. Jalen Brown. Side step. Lambs. Good. Got to go to the side. White chasing Durant. Durant gets inside. All the way to the rim. And the strong finish. Tatum. And Beale. Two good friends. Two St. Louis products. This time, Tatum wins in a chance for a three point play. Holiday spots up. Mines up that three point and nails it. Three holiday. In double figures. Nerkich doubles. Hornett was right there, but he fouled him. Nerkich just muscled it in. Hornett tips it out. Burant, feel up and under. Beautiful pass from Durant, Bradley Beale. With the finish, she's got 21. Durant goes inside and scores. Back to six. Durant stops, shoots, scouting a three. Tatum, a holiday, sidestepped, three-pointer, corner three. Durant against holiday. Durant fighting, jump shot, got it. Not just 32 points, 13 of 18 from the field. And Tatum gets inside misses, but who's there? Little Cornette to clean it up. Tatum, long three-pointer. It's good. Nice to Tatum. Now with 16 and a lead right back up to nine. He'll sneaks inside, 23 for Beale. All in the ball bowl. It's the way shoots over Cornette and scores. Brown throws it up, Cornette throws it down. And at a quick time out, Frank Vogel not happy to lead up to 13. Beale against Pritchard. Pritchard making him work. Beale bags it home. What a pretty shot from Bradley Beale. Roy Sohniel, an excellent wing defender guarding Tatum, has loads of points. And the next down, the three. Jason Tatum coming alive, here on the second half. Or Gordon on the drive, picks it out, ball bowl. Put it on the floor. You're looking jump shot. As Jalen Brown lays it up and in, and quickly points to his teammate for the fine pass. Durant, no problem. 35 points in 30 minutes. And Beale comes flying in for the rebound. Throwes it ahead to Cornel. Cornel back to Durant. Cornel's going to try. And finally gets one of the goals. Jalen Brown on the drive goes inside. Lay up as good. 27 points for Jalen Brown. Durant for three. 38 points for Kevin Durant. Tatum on the finish. Exploding to Durant and it's back up to 10. Durant, fighting room, puts it off, puts it in. He's 16 for 22, a 40 point game for Kevin Durant. Durant pull up jumper. Count it and the foul. Chance for a three point play. And a chance to cut it to five. Holiday. Out the whorfer. Whorfer to three. Bang! Oh, whorfer from downtown. And then a half to go. Tatum drives on Durant. Gets inside and backs it home. Durant drives down a lane. And the flush. The season high 45 for Durant. Very close to an eight second count. Two holiday sees. Drives inside and throws it down. Grace and Alan drives goes inside. Lays it up in a minute. They're just not giving up three. And whorfer spins. Whorfer drives. Kicks it inside. Tatum. And one that will certainly do it. As Richard brings it across the timeline. Celtic skip there. 49th win of the season. Now 49th.
