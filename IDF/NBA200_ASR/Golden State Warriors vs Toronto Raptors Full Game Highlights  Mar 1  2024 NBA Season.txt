 Second night of a back-to-back. Drain Mon Green will jump center against Yaka Burtle, controlled by Scotty and the Raptors. Who's it went on to win? Kaminga kicks it in the corner. In the corner three from Moody is good. RJ Parris driving kick. Plane. He has been on fire as he knocks it down from the sea at some words. Publicly about Steve Kerber really sends that time. He's played well RJ Parris underneath with a scoop shot. Plane misses. Here's Barnes. Scotty P knocks down the green. Off the side of the backboard trying to draw the foul. He hit it that time. Moody and he'll lay it up and through. And Purtle's missed a couple of shots later. Certainly within his range, 66 percent. Few more percent. It's all over the corner. Bucket the other way. Quickly transition three. Go! Time out. Steve Kerber. Understandably so. Three NBA titles in his first four years. Three is good. Rappers are five of eight from three. And one another title in 2022. Here's Curry. Turn. Fire. Got it. With a big line up with Purtle. This is a small warrior scene. Just looking with it out there. Dreamy green is the biggest. Curry. Three. Got it. And he's got to see Scottie dominate the paint. Green. I have this assignment. So this is opportunity for him to show and prove again his abilities. Green, good. Curry. Aido Ron in a timeout. Rappers on top. Cavaluni at the foul line. Jumper doesn't go and Peyton had inside position. And bats it in. Offensive rebound and getting second opportunity already for offensive rebound. Can't give the team a second chance. Right to the iron with a slam dunk. No, it's not Steph Curry, but their system. They're going to move. They're going to set screens. They're going to do dribble handoff. You have to stay connected. Nothing changes. Wow. The check in. Six key onus. Dario starts checking in. And Gary Peyton there. The adjane figure five. He was shaking it. Still shaking it. But it made the sleep. The gookie though. And a turn of the shot clock. You can see the Rappers packing in a bit. Without the shooting on the floor. Now you can pack it in a bit. And out of Peyton. He plays big. Bring him back. Wait a minute. We missed him. Lock down. Gip sends it over to Barnes. Scottie. Attacking with a left. Just attacking the smaller Warriors team. Sarritz. Kicks it out. Not a repost. And back to him. You go easy thinking he likes to get to that mid range. We'll pull up to three now. Here's Kelly. All of that. Forkestrained by Scottie Barnes. Barnes. Gip with the other face. Backing in on pole. Spinning around. Not smaller. Gip with the bucket. And the pain is smoothie attacking. And trying to get around Gip unable to do so. Brown back to Gip with the green. Gip connects. Paul. Here's Sarritz. Paul. At the end of the clock. 12-19 shooting against New York. Matt Planned with force. Going downhill. Taking advantage. Moving well with a brief pass. Yacht of hurdle. After still by five. Curry. Kamehameh. Cruise it down. Here's Grady. Turns it corner. And scooped up by Yacht of hurdle. And then with a personal matter. Time table for history turn. And then it. Top landing. As the raptors will big on the inside as you mentioned. Moody bats it up the hand. Moody to top score for the Warriors. That was first play of the game. Manga. Good job defensively there. He shot doesn't go the rebound. Scottie is still in front of the fence. That bucket is good. Holding his left hand. And now he comes up, commits a foul. Remember earlier he tried to catch a pass. In a attacking defense. And then he lost ball tied up. Curry somehow finds Manga. And flexes. His career. Because I know you guys remember. Yeah. Him and Vince playing one-on-one. She made it. They let them play today. I'll tell you that. Toronto will be playing. Cut the fence and stuff. And no day. It's mom. You still have those pictures that they'll carry out. They'll be playing. Yeah. They'll be playing. Yeah. They'll be playing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But we have fun. We got a loan. That was a good thing. Can you go to the home and can you go out and play together? See, Dell on Sunday and ask him about the outfit. Ask him about it. Mark Jackson. Another one of my OGs is the Gary Trigg Jr. Find his way. Wiggle his way for it. R.J. is scored 20 plus. Back to back games. 13 times. He's in the back door. Camingo with a slam dunk. He's getting into the office earlier. Most play tops in over the green. Another neat Camingo lays it up. This is the largest lead for Golden State. Good pass. Parade underneath. Rampers are unable to come away with the offensive rebound. Here's Curry. Curry fires away. Re-bounds have really hurt Toronto. They did a good job in the first half. Lake Thompson. It's like a page on my book. That's all I'm saying. Paul Jackson Davis with a slam dunk. I wish I could say a page that is broken. Still be out there passing like that. Thompson. Who say to Carton? Up top. Yeah. He transfers to Santa Clara was a West Coast conference player the year. DJ Carton delivers a three. Player of the year entered the draft. First round pit. And he starts for Golden State. Grand Underwood. The head coach of the University of New York. Let's take it to bed. Santa Clara worked out for Steve Nash. Davidson College worked out for Steph Curry. Here's Paul. Sticks it. Carton picks him up. Stays against Switz. Tionus spinning around off balance. You know, the team was faster. Get the ball to the floor quickly. Yeah. There's Grady with a bucket. Scotty boy. 11 point game. Now back to 13. Just remembering the hell's number. Most of those guys are young. And they're wrapped in facility on the third floor. Tamega and a foul. He knocks down the green. The ability to take in the onus. They're going to the bench. Come off the bench. Now he's performing like Clay Thompson. Hard jam. Inside with a right hand. Grady runs to the corner. Yeah. With the green. Since January 1st. Second night of the pack. The pack. This season. We need all teams in there. Nine wins. Yeah. And that's going to do it as a fall 120 to 105. Raptors are now.
