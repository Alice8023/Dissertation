 You ready? You game? I'm game. Little thing. We go of course now with that left hand straight and tightness. The game at Golden State. Buddy, he'll try to get loose on the baseline. Buddy with 18-based threes in his first four games. And the sixer with a turn over there. Brunson rattles it in the first corner. He creates just enough space to see how defenders at times can be bouncing off the Brunson. He's filling all the star, Tyler East, Maxine gets the scoring strategy for the sixers. Art Shine over to Brunson. He is the strong that stirs the drink now in the Spinnig past tolerate, Dishine. Josh Hart from outside and Hart fills the three. Some Thibodeaux as we know, like, turned the screw on defense. And a really a reflection of their coach now. Brunson trying to step around his defender and instead just goes up and overpullery. There's Kevin Schupe, something Mark on. And that three, five straight misses now for the sixers and Achua. Slens it down on the dish from Josh Hart. Here is coming over to Dumbledore. The ball with the five nicks. The queue up. Brunson rattles in the three. Third triple already tonight for the next. And it just looks like they're playing at a slightly different screen. Good seal there by Tobias Harris. Buddy from outside. Buddy buckets. Franzer three. Maxie fakes the three. Looking for a little space game. Finding. First time Larry and Nick Dady goes. Come on, Larry with a reverse first ball. Well, it's just remarkable. Obviously, he's better than he was in Dallas with Luca, but man, I didn't think he'd be this good as Kelly responds to the lefty layup. Very happy to come here to New York as well. Obviously, he was coached by Nick versus up in Toronto. Nicely done. That's plenty of defense there. Don't fall for that face. Maxie, nice pass to the bottom who has it. Not to way by Achua. Perhaps a reach by Achua. All right, right to the cup. Nobody stepped in front. 21-12. Three and a half to go in this first quarter. Elevator doesn't quite make it to the penalty. Maxie, Kevin. Maxie in the foul. For Tom Reese, Maxie. Pretty hectic Chris Quirley so far. Brown is into it. Burps. Around and no, but Jericho's sin is there for the emphatic put back. A year, a year and a half ago, but it looks confident and fluid on that puller. Largest lead for the next tonight. 28-15. Kelly gets it to go. Win on that season high and nine game win streak. That's 33-22. In the fourth spot, sixers in the five. Lauri, high off the win. He's one of those shot-cluckies on. Brutten, as it's stolen, Kelly. To beat the clock, it's Ubrae. Brutten down. The ability at times to get some shots, creates a space. Still learning the game. Kyle Lowry, bite of Harris on the back side cup. Not amazing. Left to short. Lowry, they hit ahead to Ubrae. By the touch pass, the heel still gets there. Not as pretty as they might have wanted it to be, but it still counts all the same. Oceans three and three from the strike. So far tonight, just locked at five. Lauri on the re-screen. Kyle, no, Paul Rea, they put the put back. Just like they drew it up. Touch pass from Hart's to Burke. Back to Hart. Hart's feeding away. Josh Hart is definitely one of the leading candidates to score with this box. Right here is the open-edibly steps into a three and drills it. Got him it's showing off the handle. Barry. Backing down. He hits. And down to the chest, another bucket. Good job of not failing. Make those tough shots. Don't fail them out. Maxie. Spinning. It's all-in and opening with the left hand. Nice move. Turn the ball over. Need to start getting some stops and making some buckets. More disconnected basketball here from you, sixers. So the Brunson kisses it off the window for two. Front court of the Nix right now having a heck of a game. A-10 for 18 points and a left rebound. Hart finally misses. That's what leaves Maxie some space to step right into that dunk. Good find from Buddy. Good find from Brunson. Do a cutting precious issue. A little bit of a looner eclipse for Halle's comment. Another chair over. You can chenzo the dunk. Largest lead of the night for New York. 61-41. Donnich from the other side of the court. And Nix Bay. Hart bounces it off the backboard once for run once again. 4-on-3. 4-on-4 now. Donnich, find some space. 5-5 from three tonight. Step up on the defensive end as well in our last two. Quotus here tonight. That's a good question. A-10. Campaign. Lowly passes defenderly. Did up a catat and the foul for campaign. No empty. No empty. Do you have two back tonight? No robber comes to sit yet. He's still side set. Fataway jokers. Activision rivals. Runs it to his right. And it's the floater. Take going there way now. Play-pointly. Back to your picture from the court. Tyree still with everything he can to get the sixers in this one. As if kicking away. Buddy, he'll take it right back. Back to your right back. Don't like back to it. Tyree. I'm going to lay down. Down the back. Down the back. Down the back. Down the back. Down the back. Down the back. Down the back. Down the back. Down the back. Down the back. Down the back. Another four. Say improvement now. If it comes it becomes much more gentle fsСТ it will be like red. Be careful with it. Because if it's the opposite it's the opposite where we want tool right now. And increase it's less than a pie of millions. Now this piece of work. It's a piece of work on that. Turn in, the back. Bowloon. Aber commented to me right next to him. 101 thing. It's the opposite. and the strong silver lost it. Saved by Niel on the baseline, shot, fucking single digits. Siamere's Maxie. Who gets so? Sins applying them with three point shooting, Randall got in the line up. The need to score to come to somewhere. Maui takes the three drives. Dishones is the mark finishes. Well, not a cystic A.J. Martin that we just showed you while they were coming up the floor, Kyle Lowry was directing traffic. Maxie with another 34 for John Rees. Your confidence is growing and perhaps the Nick's diminishing a little bit. John Rees, tough shot. I see you do it, 34. Bobby's going to be OK. Lowry down here. Just the lowly Kyle Lowry beats the buzzer. But I thought Anna Nobby was just starting to kind of gel with his new teammates. I'm going to set him back a little. Sorry, the driver and the kid. What a heel from that antenna. That's free call. It's out of it. Maxie the rebound. And head to Ubrane. Kelly. Yes, sir. I'm going to see what happens, guys. I'll keep you up, baby. All right. You post a tear in another office at rebound from the next. And the best chance to shoot another three. Good job of not failing, Brunson. No bailouts. Make him down the stretch. Have to make tough shots. Ubrane with a little bit of space. Kelly, he's it up it in. Pocket five. Kelly, base starting Brunson denying him the ball back. He's even Chen Zoh the great cuck. Brunson, kidder Pat. A chua. Layer for the rebound. The put pat. Annie draws the foul. Some of it having to do with the tired legs. Some of it with deep, mixed defense. Chen Zoh from the way. To the first three quarters tonight. But no point in the last nine minutes. Ubrane to the belt. Ubrane. He's just too strong. Tyrese looking a little bit tired after expecting so much effort. He had the third quarter in Josh Hart holding the follow through. To get back into a game. Sixers were down 26. They put a half of a third quarter. Looking a little worse for the wear here in the fourth. He's even up yet. Is what he fans by McBride and Nancy didn't get enough on that pass. Please be crying. Look at that. Fight of Rook and fight off the fatigue. The best of our nights. There's Lauren. Lauren lays it up it in. While your sixers fall to 32 and 23 on the year. 17 and 12 here at the Wells Fargo Center.
