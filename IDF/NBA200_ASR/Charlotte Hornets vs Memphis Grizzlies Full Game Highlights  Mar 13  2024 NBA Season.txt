 I'm getting one. You ready? You game? I'm game. EGA card, which means he's a really, really good golfer. Actually, Barbecue's pretty good as well. I know it all too well. Uh-huh. A lot of time on the court. Backed out by Bridges, and he hits the hook. This is how Bridges averaging the ball. Handling, fun point position. But also the decision-making from that area is Luke Denard did a great job. But certainly the assist is, we just get to turn around inside. But to have some. Dippin' missing 12 games. Just a little back issue. Can I, for three, back goal. Bridges have the lead as Luke Denard. In a single three. Three bout Bridges. Good look ahead. Miller, tough catch, and a finish. And the Grizzies take time out as the Hornets out to a three-point lead. Speech it to steal. Also a third turn over here for the Grizzies. Early in his game, Lee's to Bridges corner three. And Canard comes around to screen, sets up Conchart. His three is through Tom Conchart. Hits from downtown. He is career. He was a little bit better in Detroit. Bridges an open three. Miles Bridges would drop 25 on the Grizzies. But a Hornets. Canard. Short with a three. Rebound tapped around. Jackson kept it alive and caught them. Canard. Jefferson going to challenge Nick Richards with a floater of puts it in. In Europe, finally, coming to the US. Grant Williams, Steine, extra pass. Nietzsche hits the three. The Seely Nietzsche, missed by Gigi Jackson. Domus Brutans in for the first time tonight. I want to see you. Talk about a little bit last night. I don't want to see that. No, nice. Good with Gose at Brutans. Shot pocket five. Turn around jumper. Got it. Short good with averaging five points per game. Was here defensively. Charlotte on the run. Man sets up Bridges. Focus, Chefsney wants it. It's an open three. It's through. He's got to be a shot. He can always replace it too. Shot clock down to seven. Two gone by second quarter. Good with. It's the three for shooting. Rebound by an appearance. Not charge. It is handed there. Forcing a turnover. Pippet on the fly. Drop off. Good with four three. Bang go. Jordan Goodwin. The camp converts. Nietzsche lob Bridges. He'll back. Conchard drop off. Pippet reverse lap is in. Pretty play. Conchard is set up. Nietzsche threw that one toward the rim. Conchard takes it to distance. Great drop off by Pippet. He's fifth in shot blocker. Rebound is four. Charlotte's the raviour tries for three. It's through. Down five. Which one half remaining in the first half. Bridges launches a three. And Bridges. What's the love playing the Grizzly? For Todd's. That is what Thomas Bratons does. Shoot three. Third offensive rebound. For the Hornets. Hocushebski Grizzlies. Defensive rotation. Little in and out. Little contact. Game up with nothing. And Bridges. And Taylor Jenkins cost time. That's not the other thing that he agrees. He's got a good score. The use trade gem is in his side. What this unit on the floor right now is Brandon Miller knocks on after three. Jerome. Gigi. Nice foul on. And I'm watching for Gigi Jackson. Gigi. Outside three is through. And Gigi with eight. Nice little run here by the Grizzlies. To finish out. Bran Williams off the back guy. But then tapped in with Tray Man. There's no highlights from the Charlotte Hornets team here. This first half. And coming back after a three game absence to the going strain. Cunard lines up a three. It's through. Okay. I guess I got my answer. It was staring at me. It was a little. And I played for Bridges. Especially for the team that you left from. But it bad. Tacey. Jamison. Use the partner. For me when I left. And I wanted to play well again. Pippin. How to get back. A conchart. Three is through. John Conchart. And I is 11 in the win at Miami earlier this season. Pippin against Mad. Got the skippin. Oh, Sky. Got a head with some just a little bit. It's almost getting the turn over back. And Nietzsche and Wabs, it's finished by Richards. That's how you want Nietzsche. What took him so long to get to the NBA. But in any event that was not a good call. My car lane to begin with and then Bridges punctuated. With that. 17 and 6 assists. Three by Gigi. Bridges. For right away in Gabriel and finishing. And the Grizzies caught the tie. Then go to the two long steps. Earlier on that dribble move. Nietzsche launches another three. Makes it again. Nietzsche. Four of five from downtown for 24. Pokkichewski. And a Grant Williams three finds the bottom. Gabriel sets the screen. LaRavia down the lane. Good win. Step back. Got it. Good win. LaRavia.

The hoop and the harm. And Bertons with a rebound. I'll look ahead. Nick Richards finishes. He's foul. And another three point opportunity. H straight by Charlotte. Steal by Miller. And the time's running. The four Miller takes it himself. I've never had one opportunity. Can't get the step out. Kippit. Bertons goes away on the screen. Kippit with a clean and press and slam.
