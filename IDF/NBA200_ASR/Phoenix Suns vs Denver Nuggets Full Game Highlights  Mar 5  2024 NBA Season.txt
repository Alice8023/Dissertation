 You ready? You game? I'm game. I'm game. Denver Nogatid is their second match up of the year. Grayson Allen, the Leaks top three points shooter, knocks down the first basket of the game. Murray finds Yokits. Yokits reigns in a three. Yokits is on an incredible run here. Significant opportunity to win a third MVP. As Murray puts his hand behind his back. As he laces one, there's called well both. He gets the steal. He'll take it all the way. Allen got a cook at early. His second made three. Yokits looking for Gordon. Not to way by Bradley Beale. Here comes O'Neill. O'Neill gives it to Durant, Durant on the board. Back to back losses for the Sun, Saturday, and Sunday against Houston and Oklahoma City. And a ton of turnovers. As Murray rattles one in, and Gordon's going to drive it. He'll kick it. Porter's been hot. And he stays hot. Beale comes up short. Nurkett popped it out of Yokits's hands. Yokits thought it was a foul. It ends up as an easy bucket for Brad Beale. Friendly bounce. Got the shooters roll. Jamal Murray has knocked down all three of his shots. They're playing to try to get a point card. Just hasn't come to fruition. They haven't been able to find that guy. Here's Yokits. Gives it up. Michael Porter. Junior. He stays hot. Problem is getting Beale and Durant and Booker on the floor all together at the same time. Has been a challenge. Has Murray hits another one. He's off to a perfect start. Alan Wanson. He's got the hot hand right now. And they keep feeding him. Grace and Alan with his four three pointer. Grant gets his third bucket tonight. How about that? Reggie Jackson catches shoot set up beautifully by Murray. And that might get Reggie Jackson going a little bit. There's Murray for three. Got another one. So the nugget's raining him in now. Durant be hounded. And down to the crowd goes Murray forces the steel. Brown. Slammed at home as the nuggets in transition. Here's Gordon with Murray on him. Gordon finds him open spaces. They have to lay it in. Yokits. Oh, how does he do it? The shuffle from the Cola Yokits. It looks like a desperation. He's got a lot of balls. He is not as peeled. Strong drive. He lays it in. Bull going up top for the block. As we get the big dump by you banks. That's going up top. Watson didn't make the catch but was able to tip it in. He actually got a little fortunate there. Murray drills the three. His second main three's got 14 now. So dangerous in that picking roll because if he gets space he can make the three. Can hit the mid range. Oh, bull, bull. Go on strong. Michael Porter Jr. hits the mid range jumper. Roddy drives. Roddy was fouled and he scores. David Roddy's strong. He lost the handle briefly. Nice finish there by Durant. On a pass that was taking him away from the basket. Durant scores it up and over Watson. Durant. Andy Scores. Kevin Durant. Tough fade away. Here's Nirkets. A little ball faking. A jam for Nirkets.

Nolan lets another one fly. Number six for number eight. Yokech. Hot pass. Gordy. Able to secure it. He scores and a foul. Gordon's going to drive it. Gordon denied by Durant. Chris, you got a chance to visit with Mike on the loan. He said it was sweet and simple into the point. He's not going to like that again. Grayson Allen gets open for another three. And now Nirkets able to lay it in. Nicola Yokech in that second quarter had just three points. Those were all free throws. He was 0 for 2 from the field with three turnovers. As Jamal Murray able to lay it in for Denver. Alan again. Wow. What a game. Grayson Allen with three pointer. Number eight. And Gordon drills one in the quarter. That's a rare three for him. Shoot under 30%. Lay clock. Durant hits it. And he's fouled by Gordon. Jamal Murray. Miss Range jumper is true. Chris Haynes reporting the Devon Booker. Could be back soon as Michael Porter drills a three. Another guy like a little bit like Durant. He doesn't have that handle, but he can just get shots over the top. As Durant does there. Durant just having. He makes it look so easy. The game's honestly not as easy as the nuggets get one and one. And now Porter forces the turn over gets the steal and the dunk. Deficit right now at 14. Here's O'Neill and Royce O'Neill. Barry to three. Nice set up there by Durant. As Yokech. That is where the nuggets need to get more production from the great.
