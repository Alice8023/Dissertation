 Welcome to one. You ready? You game? I'm game. My name was a time. When you know yourself. We're making his first dark throw for home of the city. He's used the starting, started for Charlotte when he was healthy, but he is in place of Dan Lid Williams out tonight with that writing. He's in place for the NBA in place. He's in position for the NBA in transition points. This is really good together. Fight it at Apple. It's a different Apple. Something that he's done over the last two games. There is a hard taking. Aggressive take by Turner going right through the seams of the defense. The case is a run-and-motion offense out front. The ball has changed in hands. One of the driest. Turner from the outside. He's going to have this opportunity tonight. Especially if Ninhard is the one defending a Siacum aggressive move spinning away from SGA. Oh, I'm green from the outside. And that free is good. Jet home green. 38% on the season had a little bit of daylight. Siacum, rumbling down the lane and finds the final wallace. Wallace right with him. Didn't buy him the pump. Bay of Calaburna. And of course it up. But there is top end right off the Pogo's dick caught at mid-air. Punch it back out. SGA drives. Forces in the way in. Just determined on Shepard who is not going to throw him down. Middle inside, outside game. And McConnell. It's just two minutes of the thunder. Wiggins. Trying to get the deck. Joe fires it over again. He will let it fly from the outside. And Josh gets a shot to drop. Broke Casey. Let's just see those shots go down. Boy, a little mismatch inside as Isaiah showed up caught on Siacum. Siacum on the catch. Siacum. To McConnell. Little Paul Figg got gitty up in the air. It just does beat the horn. And Jerry Swacker on the other end. Wicked response for Indiana. You don't have me basket. Got a three-border out of it. All green. Top spin move on the baseline. Got it up over the outstretched arm. A walker that is good. Hey, well. The Wiggins trying to turn the corner. Nice move. Got to the top. At the speed to get around McConnell. Extra pass. Wiggins. Got a nice take. Shot clock under five. Top shot. Right in mind. The Martegnault set after the game on Sunday that Jason Wallace was in intriguing because of his playmaking. His SGA waste no time coming into the game. It shows a little touch below the free throw line. Just 44 percent shooting for the thunder. The robber top and my goodness top and off hand with the 40. Thunder turn it over. Top spin. Kick to that in hard. Turn. Faces up. Too much space. Too much size. They can have difficult fit in to get those little easy shots. They can have a free throw. There's a steal. A little miscommunication. It means they're doing it on the other end getting above the rim. And the thunder with a little spurt here. You see if you can stop right here. You can shave it down even more, Parker. You've got this until six point depths at several times. Oh, a Halliburton on the drive and then shows the touch pulled up just short of SGA. Always looking around, finding those angles and those driveways to the basket. J. Stop. On a drive, pulls up right over the Smith. He's been on the move with the ball in his hands. Good job now. Get those quick baskets and they're trying to get the ball out of the hands. Halliburton. SGA come. As he decides to give it up as he does. We can get it back. Turn. Off the move. And have the step on Hayward. Hormgren trying to get by everybody and does. Thanks to that hit-ahead pass and Jett Hormgren flashes it down. Worked his way down in the block. Nice shot. There's Smith. There's a transition opportunity for the Pacers. Got it down. Six Hormgren will step behind the tape. That's back to back. Three is for Oklahoma City. First it's Hayward, then it's Hormgren. Both his two. That's a five-year-old. Turner off the catch. And just like that in the end with five quick basket. Halliburton. As a transition, the speed and the finish. There's a rare time, RESTJ has been able to get around to the defender. You'll take that because it's real that they've shot out a sequence. And Jay that time. Just enough of a move to break away from the defense. Jay drives, bounces Hayward. Dork checks the line. Hayward fires in. It's the three. We've got that opportunity for Indiana. Halliburton. Speed. Hayward. Hanged. Left-hand and finish. And he's able to spin it in. This Indiana offense. He can ditch it quickly. Jay walks again. Cowards just right in the lane. Just got inside the block. Jay kept the pivot foot down. There's the ducat in for Isaiah Joe. And it's a clean block according to the officials. McConnell. Somehow works underneath. He's able to score. High-powered offenses. He's able to get the ball. It's a seven point game. Cancent-Rollace. There's the put back on the rebound by Josh Gittie. And we've got a five point game. The tackle. Always comfortable to play this hand. Go back to his face and then he's on. At least man takes the ball. And he's throwing. He's through it. He's able to keep that offense. He's going back. Back goal. Go ahead. He's going to smash here. Wallace does not want to foul. Siacum. Siacum spins. Floats and scores. Wait. Stunner's deck. No. Yes on the front row. Aston Wallace. From the outside yet again. Rips the chords from three. All that experience. Three more threes tonight. Smith, bouncing off a home. That's just a nice finish. One possession game. Door almost had to steal. Siacum again. And that's just an aggressive take. Pascal Siacum. Oliver, the speed to cut. With throws out. Smith goes up and scores to the cut. Just got to stay with. Oliver to the finish. The three from Menhard. Gives the Pacers. The bracket Dave then looking for over the last few possessions. After all the offense in the third, they score to look at much like the first. And SGA finally gets one to go down as he sinks one from Dave. We'll miss back here with Paul Green out of the perimeter. What does he decide to do? Turner running shot. Top shot and Turner able to convert. Ombreshed. Logged down the lane. Put back. Spins off the rim. It's Halla Burton on the other end. Games in the air. And Jessica is a boy in New York. Not a pressure. I had to build a little bit for O.K.C. But down we're doing. And the score is going to go to the three-core line for a possible three-point play. This is all about getting stopped. Jessica's just looking at the pace of the off. That's a big basket. The Halla Burton. From downtown. Halla Burton. And Sadness says he's got the scoring shell on the turn around. They're mid in 42 left clock stops. And if they're not going to foul. The Halla Burton. The Halla Burton. The Halla Burton. The Halla Burton.
