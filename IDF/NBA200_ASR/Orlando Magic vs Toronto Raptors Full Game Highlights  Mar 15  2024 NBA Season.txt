 I'm getting ready. You game. I'm game. Sending all of our love to the Barrett family. They are a beautiful, wonderful family and, uh, a thawed some prazer with the Barrett family and, uh, God bless. I'm going to have to go. Sugs with the three. The guy that's always open is the guy that gets a screen. Set's a screen. Fobner. They chuffed tape. Here's Gary. He finds an open space. Jumper doesn't go. He's taking now Sugs. Rats him up and the three pointer. Not 38 percent. He's made three now in 11 straight games. Turn over. Bang parrow. And a quick timeout. We're going to get the full time out. So make him reset on the side out. Raptors now by five and Fobner gets to the rim and and inching closer as Ben Carrow's leg up doesn't go to the 500 level on the road. Red one for Brady. Five. Oh, John. Bang carrow. Carter. And Carter knocks it down. All four losses. Single digits. The hell of it. All the games. And smart when you're rebuilding and then you sustain the injuries that the Raptors have is Kelly. Linnick knocks it down. Raptors for a 10. Great look. Gary. From Halifax. I'm Harris. Harris cut off by a Linnick. Active defensively Bruce Brown. On the court. County. And the foul Sugs will head to the foul. Longers getting stops. Getting after it defensively. The job by right there the spin and Cole Anthony. Brown. Gibble smooth. To the cutting. War out. Takes contact. Infinices. Greatest player in the history of Buffalo. Foblin. Here. Come on. We were going there. Great Foblin here. Spinning. Brown's five. There. Why is he creative that? Assistant Miami. Who's a great player. It's a great three-pointer. Good as some shit. Howard on the roster. That's it. It's in on the deck in the corner. Isaac. And the three is good in a four-point game. In terms of their assignments. What they do. And the layup in a two-point game. Porter with the steel. Quickly. Ramsay. Gather. Seven points off of the bench. Yeah. Good job. The prep emptied undrafted. Pascal a late first round picked. Hey, quickly. It's about finding guys. They can hoop, right? And you can find a player at every spot. Paul Anthony knocks it down. I heard a poor. The bodgey with it over to a linnock. Orlando by one. And Captain the foul. Sugs commits the fouls. Some guys had paid a good out of there. And then for the flannel. And some other guys. Pancaro. Carter. In the foul. Re55. In Reggie. Yeah. To round things out. So I'm sitting here with you. Pancaro. Lays it up in the groove. That relies on each other to get the quality shot, right? So you got to be that much better collectively. Raptors 39% from the field. And Gary's in junior. The seven main three. Probably in the lead. Maybe two minutes. The last two minutes of a game. The official who gets their own challenge, ability to challenge themselves. Pancaro just a little slam dunk. Defensively. You know some of the things they could do. But you look at Orlando. Double comes. Harris swings. Sugs gives it. Now low. Carter. And a foul. Tough bad joke that time. But quickly he got caught in the rotation. And it got caught up. And a little question about that. Apache. Up top. And he wants bad. There's Sugs. You're mad at deep. He's playing those Christmas albums, right? 50% of the proceeds go to and more sea foundation. And goes to Special Olympics Canada. So. Wagner slips. Strides of thrown off a war. A numbers. Here we go. Here's Apache. Jeff Ayer. Down Bay Street. War attendant Warren knocks you away. Orlando by one. From Furny B.C. Shootin' in with confidence. Breathe before from behind the arc. Rathers by two. There's a last eight. Thanks guys. Well, you know, striking at the right time. It also helps when you have a roofalop guys that know what it's like to win. That according. Bang Carole. So that guy right there, puffed big carer. I caught up with him. Boys. When they play against playoff defense, they get it done. They're free by ground. It's good. And they can see to two. The defense and makes a beautiful pass opposite to the shooter. Two coaches. And Angles 3 is good. Certainly should have been in the count of the cases for that to be. Open morning three. Got it. Seems really connected. How many share the boys? 89-73. Quickly. Finds rancy. Sunday night. Jack's going to have the selection show all sent to go. There's Cole Anthony with the three. Scott Barnes Ford. Angles turns the corner. Finds Moe Wagner with a slam dunk. I be 88-1. Brown attacking. Trent Jr. years brown into the front court over to Kelly. Kelly. Gary. Go on. And Raptor's putting it together. Ramsay. Raptor's get another stop. Here's Gary. Rise up. Fire. Bucket and bucket. Make this game exciting down the stretch. Gary missing the last two games and then playing Detroit. The cup. The bucket. It's gone. Beautiful movement out the rock by Grady Dick and the find by Brown. Sucks. Kelly. Linnick believes it's an offensive foul. 535 remaining in the court. Linnick. Nice move. These turns. They caro backing in. Clock down to three. Down to two. Sucks left open. Dick. Jacking kicks it. Here it is. Give it to Gary. And a little start in the green. He thinks penetration. Carter left open for three. Time out taking. Carter 40% from three. You have that motor that can tell the drive. A competitive spirit. You can see it on their team. There's no question. From a percentage standpoint. From year one to two to three by 100 points in percentage. And selection Sunday. Coming up.
