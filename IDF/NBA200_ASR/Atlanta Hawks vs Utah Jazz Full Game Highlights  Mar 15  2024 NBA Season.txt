 I'm getting one. You ready? You game? I'm game. For six years tonight I saw him hug a couple of broadcast guys. I've got a couple of the assistant coaches, but it's more business like for him tonight. Play on as Hendrix misfires from three, but Collins cleans it up. There's Kante going to work looks inside. He'll take the open look for three. He's been read hot from downtown. Had his seventh, five, three point made game against Boston inside Atlanta. Collins for three. Back to back triples. Here's Sexton, fall through rebound drives into the paint fearless scorzer. We aren't taking George, but couldn't get it to go. Murray rebounds, goes to the hot hand deep, and another arrow into the crowd here. A tighter to avoid that step back jumper. We're Murray. Kante, a little stop and go pass over the top and Rick's good look from three. How about John Conner? Jumping on it. I really like his work. He's not going to hurt you. Jeffers get the turnover. Good defense, Sexton. Collins with the finish. Just reading the defense, finding those open lanes. This is first two shots and drops one inside. No way. No way. Garrison Matthews' toss is footing. He's got shot, Johnson. He's Garrison Matthews. Very slow. Jalen Johnson, fresh off. That vehicle spring, Kester finds Preston. Drops it off to Johnny. It's the three. The three is reducing. Second year on a use. It was not fair to help protect the paint. He's going to do what? The Jazz and John and I have out rebounded them by sevens. Positives in the first. Walker. What a shot. Atlanta working the perimeter. Now the shoulders down the step back. J for two good. Walker denied by Capela. He met him halfway up and put him down on the floor. There's a Jalen Johnson move. He throws up. The THD can take advantage of that. Potentially drive past that first guy. Pretty good. He said something to Bryce that's gone his way back down the court. Dash it inside. Lay it up. Kester with two. Here's Deandra. Hunter one on one. It was since about those baseline. Quick step in one. Atlanta's caught from distance. Jion take gives it up. They're the quick hit three. Off the mark. Ball deflected out. and the three is good. Denon Johnson, this he redirected that shot. Colin will pull up for three and to home. Love sections, double figure things that up. First bucket in this game after a couple of free throws. That's a good one. Beautiful move in the one-on-one situation. I think the three game is going to be a good one. Yeah, that's the question. And something to discuss in the offseason for sure. Because I think that's the first time I've ever had a three games good for about 11 assists a game. There's a bucket. Another Subaru. Mark Miller Subaru Utah's only negotiation three. Subaru retailer. Pulled this train and Capella slams home at seven point. All seven here in the second quarter. Touch shot. I want some of it all. That's what you get from Bryce Sensible. It's all the men. That's in back sound. About a second between shot clock game clock. Double drives. Sexton off the glass. The follow by Walker. Nice they've done. Questions of four. Six point, second quarter. And the jazz down one. And that's where we will hit the locker room. A one-point game and soul. Back for shot clock at five. Sense of ball. Passes on. Collins toes it up deep. Bank. One of the other love animations. Off the Taylor Hendrick slices inside ball. Flot. Capella got a piece. Starts a break for Atlanta. There's a reach in. They're going to count that bucket on the continuation. Quick outlet. Kianta. Your old steps in. Oh, my goodness to you. Very well. Yeah, think about it. He's the same fight as Michael Jordan. The same play. Sense of ball. The exact shot. That shot. Caramagne. Which is soft. Good mark. Capella. Great. She's back at it. Fires it off the West Matthews. He'll drive inside. Up and in. Still getting a done. 15 years. Just think a year ago he's playing college shoes. Kianta smart move. A hat. See that. That pressure. Six minute mark. And the third. Collins sets a high screen. Sexton. Oh. Sexton on a string. In his pocket. He's going to get a shot. He's going to get a shot. He's going to get a shot. He's going to get a shot. He's going to get a shot. He's going to get a shot. In his pocket. The garrison Matthews. Out front. Preachie. Matthews again. Fires up the triple. It's in his contract, baller. In his good injury. That's going to be in just 15 feet. He can come back. And then lay off. He'll spin inside. That's a tough shot. No, the summer league. Right. But he's got. He's learned that from his teammates. Got like Collins. Sexton's a good example. Three ball wide. Deandre. Four hundred THT. Downhill. Very long. Potter. Three. Oh, yeah. Potter. Let's see. There's been a lot of time in the G League working on that Capsule shoot with him. Side. There's Hunter. Like that catch up. Drops in water in front of the jazz base. Locker space. Up and in. No. All the black and out. Fernando. Good. Good defensive. Yeah. Effort on that lob inside. There's a high swinging shot by Murray. Walker Kuster's miss. Three seconds to get a shot away. It would pressure on the ball at the horn. Let's see if that one counts. For the moment, yes. There's 125 points in his pocket. Guarded by Taylor Gordon. Tucker ball. Stressed. Picked up by Potter. Juzen. On a drive. One team. One team's problems is another player's opportunity. We're seeing him on both sides of the ball right now for both teams. We're going in on Johnson. The Kessler hands it back to THT. Strong. Walker gave up the shot. I can't. One. One. The short shot. How about that. Walker. It gave it up. Turn it over. Here's West Matthews. Three's up. Good. Picked up by Matthews. Back out. Murray. Still not. Sexton. Stops. Drills. Yes. He knew it. He walked away. Team 110. Four minutes left. Inside pass. Oh. Johnson had a floater but he gave it inside to the captain. A George surveys. Left hand dribble drive. I'll be glad. I'm going in. I'm going in. I'm going in. I'm going in. Left hand dribble drive. I'll be glad. Left hand. Johnson. It's a tough move. It's a tough move. Catch you shoot. Keyotech. Good look. I'm going in by Sexton. Take it up. Come on, go. Big, big, come on. The one of the amazing steel by Colin Sexton. I'm a strong dunk. The John T. Murray with his answer. Two minutes left. This keyotech. Stop and go drive. What? We're watching some great guard play. One, twenty four, one, sixteen. Freeze up. Three. He's not saying Murray. He's trying to get a stop here. Nope. Heavy throws, brother. I'm going in. I'm going to have to see. Here we go. Look at the bounce screens with the John Tade. John is giving him open. Here we go. There we go. Back court. Seven to play. Down to six. Three. Three. He's not saying Murray. He's trying to get a stop here. Nope. Down to six. They double, they glitz over the top. Crazy. Jazz will hold on. And win. And beat the hawks.
