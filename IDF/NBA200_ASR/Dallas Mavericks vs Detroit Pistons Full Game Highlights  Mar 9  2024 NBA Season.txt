 Well, good one to one. You ready? You game? I'm game. The lower ball will be Jan. We're underway. Dallas gets it first. It's in the hands of their superstar, Luke. Gives it up to Derek Jones. I re-urban from the lane. Flips it up, fills it up. I re-urban works against Kane. Rises in the Kane. Fire's going to be short. Rebound, Dylan, there. Swipe though, rebound, hands to Kane. Kane from the foul line. That's it. Sworzen. That was a quick hitter right there. The Kane, stop and go. One to go down. He's to Kane. Ivy's swipe by Gantzich. He's top ten in the steals and a league as well. The Jones-jumper for the drive and the doose off the square. Dallas four for ten. Pistons two for seven out of the gate. Mavricley 10-6. Very early. Nice green from Gapord. Topside, Luke, it's in the long gun. It goes. Dika Dachie, two to basket. Nice shot. Blocked, he hit the floor. J-90, topside, he came for the long gun. It goes. Then he Johnson and Isaiah 68 combined in 83 at San Antonio. It'll be hard to get to that 88 with John and Isaiah. That's really difficult. K-90, the beach two in the corner. At Kane on the wing. The fire and fill it up. Oh, look back. It's down over Josh Brees. Luke and Dachie. Stumbles. This is one at the other way. Kane, Lodge, Kane, Weissman, Jamm. Josh Brees still with it. Mounts is inside the exit. Corner feet, high re-urban. All by himself. He buries it. A triple for Kyrie. Samser with a screech from Weissman. Side line up on Tecchio and E-Triple. Jason I've been using a Weissman screen inside of the Big Bang. Double clutching for the ramp. No rebound to Ceebot. I re-urban about to go way, way up to Greene. Josh Greene lays it in. Makes the brief go. J-90 cross-court to Sasser. With a corner, Tecchio rides the fire, still good up. Handles it against the double team. This pass battered away by Tecchio. The J-Nivey. J-Nivey's on the run. To the ramp. Go to the high glass and scores it. Tecchio puts it on the deck. It's the pass to Evan 40, clock at one. Back to Cibone. Got it to the air. Off the glass and good. He did. Feet the buzzer. 10 1 1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1. Marcus Sasser from the way. And E-Triple. Nice to see it. Hit one from behind the wall. Look at Dunches. The baseline high glass got won't go. Rebound capped outside of Kyrie Irving. Bounces it. Side line. 41 39 Dallas. Jade to the basket. No. One chip by S.R. No. Another chip. No save by J-Nivey. To S.R. Get it in Cade on Dunches with Tecchio. Right now, Jade has got him. Luke Atturn. Fire fills it up. Cinder in your long story career. And I know it's full of a season. But what stands out maybe in the middle of my life? I have the signature of accomplished work. In the public, don't you think? Yes. Well, first of all, I have an opportunity to be at his headquarters in LA, which is amazing. He's amazing. It is wonderful to see a Michigan stator who has become so successful. I remember when the water crisis happened and I reached out to Tom Gors and the team. You've got lots of pistols in the community as it is. There is no question about it. Yep. I have a favorite piston of all time. I mean, so many to choose from in your at. So, but you know, I have some other favorites. By the way. Look at me. I have, I have like, beyond the pistols. That's a bit of a flying and falling. The last couple of minutes. Luke Aduch and Cakes, the shot inside the cappard for a jail. It ends up with the hands and the eyes are yurvy. Lefty Layin' No. Cade the other way. Cades pass in front to Beastouf. Against the Thalas Tavrex, at least two of their defenders. Ten in the first, nine in the second for Cade. Luke into the lane. Luke into the basket. Layin' up. Layin' in. Luke get. I've got Beastouf. Crosses over twice. And fires the way down. Town and drains it. This guy started off very slow. Luke Aduch and the Bassy Balls, 28 points and counting. Tyreurvy, topside screen from Gappert. Tyreurvy from the lane. Shots around and down. Pistons within four. Ten now and 18 to play in the third. Luke Aduch and the Elbow. Perfect with the shot. Cade against Jones junior-wise behind the screen. All poked away. Go junior drives the dumps. Cade and Ivy for three off the heel. Wise them with a rebound. Dade will try from the other side and splashes this one down. Luke into the lane. Back up over his head. The Jones junior way outside to Cade. Re for three and it's through. What are you going to do? Luke Aduch keeps the dribble. Turned inside. Get to the basket. Layin' up. Layin' in. Doc lock inside. Ten. Dunchich. Underused that strength that does to the basket. Layin' up softly at in. Layin' in his own pace. Can't speed him up. Here's Cade to the basket. Nice lock. The James Whitewood for a jam. Cade with a screen from Wiseman. Inside the game. Deep bounce five. Tekkiho lays it up. Layin' in. Exum for the Mavericks. Playing without Luke Aduchich right now. It's to the lane. Washington junior fires and fills it up. Drives it.

Inside for Gafford and a jam. A to assist for Luke Aduchich to go with his 36 points. Lucas pass. Find Jones junior. It's inside for the score. Got one as 13. Bontechio. Nice lob to James Wyzen for a jam. Bontechio's play really well tonight. Lot of scoring. He even has a couple of assists. Great assist there. That's assist at nine rebounds for Lucas. One board away from another triple double. He did the basket ball better the way. He rips it back away. He made the fourth court. He did with the shot right down the middle. G8 navies. Lost the handle. Green deep passes to Hardaway. Lays it up easily and in. A 12-second foul. 4-05 to play. Wyzen inside for a score. That's it for his fifth straight. 30 plus point. Triple double. Not the people on duty, too. This is running down to Fontechio. James Wyzen hand off the Malachi Flynn. Snaps the pass to Brown. Deep to James for a South Cross slam. Underwood.

He's a good player.
