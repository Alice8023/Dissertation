 The difference is go Portland and Milwaukee since we've last been in this building and almost a wick but the hornets come down with the jump ball has third in the NBA in block shot. Lopez extra pass to the new. Malay can easily hit the gray. He's got a lot of points. That says a lot about your defense. Really. There's a nice. Right there by. Tray, but. Your perimeter players can get real. Born half men into our game. Another block by little pass. He is so much quicker than he looks. Think you can get it up quickly before he gets there. Oh, baby. In the landlord. I'm going to put their body in front of him. He needs a very little room to get into the room. Even as a rookie, that was his exceptional trait for Anna Miller. Right on the break. It's a little point there. You're when he gets the free throw line. He gets a cut back break point. So taking away those effort points can help out. Thank you Ashley. How much keep talking at the point is on the four. Nothing wrong. Put it in my boys crib when they. They're right. Oh right away. Oh Bobby. Bobby Portis doing Bobby Portis thing. For a shot all time. Rapper on pay. Oh, what a smart play. For Brandon Miller. Now the big man was going to land on him and took advantage. Horn is down eight. Pat Connitton comes into the game for the first time. With the left hand Bobby Portis in one opportunity. Mechich Grant Williams into the game. Seth Curry. Bridges. It's Brandon Miller and that's Curry. His first shot attempt is good. Shooting guards out of Notre Dame. Yeah. Curry. Nice laps. And Curry. Look at that. There's no shame in that. They are loaded out there. Yeah, loaded with young talent. The Anna Tentett Cupball. That was quick as something's head on season long. Jack Locks down to five. Williams. Put it right. And that's the small ball. Yannis and that gives Grant William airspace. Get that deep three off. Oh. Great Williams again. Great. Yannis is out. Beverly. Yannis gets the rebound over Bridges. We play on. And another dunk friend, Petticole Ball. Beverly. Patrick. Beverly. He's in the most things of the four with a new coach coming through his team. He has the attention to these guys. Brandon Miller has the attention to the bucks right there. First three pointer for Brandon Miller and the beat continue. Miller has a point. He has the consistent. Look at that. One point ball game. Again, no pro Lopez. Bottle bottle matches for Thursday. Cut it all to baseline. Train. Eventually, he's going to settle in with his accent. Curry. Got it. Just like his daddy used to. Miller, turn around. Well, point for the first half for Brandon Miller, Richie Richards. Burntons and Miller. Mark basketball. The coach is binding. We're going to get at least one or two of those in team. One is only down by seven. In a 10-run, two-oh, or a 11-hundred. Got it. Special score. It is looking season. You're starting. Point, second quarter for Brandon. Answered by Damien Lillard. Miles has a score. 14 scoreless minutes. Easily. Oh, he won. Miles Bridges made a mind. Scormagall with a foul. And he's a one-hundred. Where's my jiff, where's my jiff? Bridges and Burntons collide with each other. Corner three, Basley. Oh, my goodness. And the lead is back up. Cut it's six. Not that long ago. Williams, a good head bank. Score with a lap 10. Oh, right there. Switch it to the left. That takes Lopez. Oh, goodness. It's off a layup on the other end. Get it out quickly. Lopez changes everything where they're off at. Manget, throw three, three bucks to get the layup. Prouder. Watch he's hit their last six shots. That speaks over. But the ball, by. Oh, no. Oh, my goodness. Did they get him an assist? They did. Oh, no other human does it. And set a good ball. Basley. Did he imagine being a guy like Basley on that team? Shot three, three throws. Then after this thought, he should have shot a couple more. He got a technical foul. He got another one. Jay Crowder up and in. Number 90 and 90 is always available. I think he goes to. Then that's worried about that. Brandon Miller, no. Leads to the run up. Basley. And the lead Basley just is fourth donk of the year. That's really the big change this year from Milwaukee. Bridges has all missed. And that's the coming in with a left hand. I'm arguing a question. Good. He can get to any spot on the floor he wants. No doubt. Jack locked out three and trained. It's in a bit in. Leap people believe that he's short. He's not. He's a real six three. Corner three. Malibu. He's in front of the Hornet's bench. He's spotted above. The shoulders never brought it down. Seth Curry. Faciliate Meachage. Ed Costor is tabling. And set a couple. He's in a pair of three. Williams rebound. Attached to pass the curry. Williams. Give me a sense of the curry. Here's Basley. Basley behind the arc. Oh, this kid struck it at this year. He is having a career year. Malik Basley put on the floor a couple of times and was well defended. Basley and Lillard both in the three point shoot out at the off-star break. Portage knocks it away. Connoit in. And now the shot clocked out of four from Milwaukee. And he shoots it high. Raw flop as hits a three. Miller. Curry plenty of time. Got it. And what Curry's doing. Good relocation there. Portage with a crease. Score the goal. Final day in the month of February. More than likely. Brandon Miller is going to be the player of the month. Check out Brook, give them up. And he sure comes once again. He was, sit down, love. Yeah, you may be the only person in the building that can speak to this. You spent 16 years in the short pants. Was there anything that you were better at? And Steph is more years than that. Stolen away by Lillard. Lillard with a beautiful circus level layup. Good question. Bertown. Oh my goodness, I like watching him shoot. Bobby Bertown. He's from Latvia. First corner ever from Latvia. Another offence of rebound, Nick Richards. Six rebounds, only 14 points. Is he trying to get his numbers? That was that good. What does the players coach? Yeah, well, Doc is a players coach. Grant Williams finds Brandon Miller in the corner. Oh, my old edges, but then I let him tip in. I thought he was going to try to get that one back in. There's a technical foul. Oh, no, Galanara shoot. Three starters in the game. Big shot. We got game bolts. Bertown, tip three. All right, so we tip our cap to the Milwaukee box. Want to see them four times and all four times the box.
