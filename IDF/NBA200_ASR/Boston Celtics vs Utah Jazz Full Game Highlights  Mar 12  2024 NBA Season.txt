 You ready? You game? I'm game. My bad moves are tough. I'm way you know it's so. Kionte, George, nothing new, right? But making great progress, 29.53s against Denver Saturday night. And the tip won by the Celtics and a 21 and 11 Rose record inside pass they go to Cornell the first play and the drive and the puck at Cornell 7th year and a Vanderbilt and he shoots lights out. Why 70% on shots like that? Yeah they've had a lot of changes in their starting lineup but they've been able to roll and react, Peyton Pritchard also coming off a great game. Kionte, George, nothing great start. Thrill, you can just see confidence every bounce, every possession for this young kid. Out of batter that shot down. How about a seven point start for Kionte? Drop 29 on the World Champion Nuggets and coming right back at you. Three ball by Derek White who goes 40% from downtown. Sexton's open, he'll take the high floating three and it will fight his way right back to Colin. And he passes it away, he's turned it over to Auser. There's a Bacchus foul and Peyton punishes the jazz and that rim. They won 13 of their last 15 and the first team to reach the 51 mark. Shamanage. Space. Took advantage of the paint. Good to read by little, I did not hesitate. Put the ball on the floor, just want to light down the land for a dunk. Well he is so confident with that shot. One of my 22, does not quite enough. Done put a hand in the face. Well, Tadon on a 10 point quarter. And his fourth year out of Oregon. That's what Peyton does, he mesmerizes you. Kind of hypnotizes you with that. Or he answers him. Kionte's got George. His future is me and we're watching it right before our eyes. Holiday and Tadon. That's deadly combo. Holiday at two time all star. No players on their team who can knock down that shot. No look pass out behind the three. It's raining. First quarter, you can understand watching the Celtics team. Why the average nearly 63 points ahead. Walker with the follow and his position. Just to make a better play with that time. Good look at it. Good good to go. Both teams guard heavy. Tadon. Peyton THD down the baseline and the pass was perfect. And a 15 point quarter for Jason Tadon. That's why he's in the MVP conversation. 27 points a game. A plus rebound, nearly five assists. There's a fucking drive. rebound, Toman. It has it out front. It worked the ball so well. Boston. You know, T you hit out a word in the first quarter. Patience. Drive stops, drive stops. Behind the three point line. They glitz them inside pass. Walker out. JC. Follow away shot. That is two. Gives it away. The fifth turnover. White. Through the hands of Cornell. Done. Here we go. Showtime it. JC. This pass the eighth and a half into marker and half number one. Done. Spins inside over the top running. And Potter. That's it. He went back and powered down to and like a Potter has fueled a seven or a run. A hip injury. They're just being careful with. Of course, Alportford doesn't usually play on back to back. So they're without a couple of key players tonight. And their 10 points are trimming upward or on top of the rim team. Yeah. Like that. Like that. Corner and time out hearty. Now take Clarkson dribble dry inside. Out it goes. Pass it. Tiantay. Deep. Straight away. 17. For the rookie. Tiantay. And that stops a seven or run by the Celtics. Tatum. Inside. Oh. I'm not sure. Holiday nearly threw a pass. Derek White. Inside. Turns it up. Out it comes. Cornette rebounds. Feeds it back inside. And a foul. Tiantay. Trying to swipe it to slowed over the last three minutes. They missed seven of the last eight shots. Section just put a stop to that. With his patented. Pull up. No question. Cross is over. And ball fell out of his hands. And. How is her with no time. Out it goes. It sends a ball. And the ball is tough down a loose. Quickly in transition. Tatum stays with it. And scores his 20th point of the night. Tatum gets the second. But Kionte never out of a play. I love that about him. Yeah. You have to pay for it. Nice. Body and potential one for Colin Sexton. So the body of the defender. Tatum doesn't get the call. But the puck with a white is just three on point. And it's really important to have that female perspective given that society is 50-50 male and female. You know, it's funny. We actually have so many women's jazz dance. More women are jazz dance than men right now. It's crazy. There's Kionte, George, with 19 points. So go to Colin. Drive on the big man. Stop it. Stop it. Pop it. It's up. Good. You know, you don't put anything past Colin Sexton. He doesn't care. He talked about it. They're coming off the back to back. Played against Fort Elmott's Knight. Oh, darn dialed in. Chris Don struggled over three on the first half. The cat's hurt. Oh, what a reach for the rebound. Shot clock reset to 14. JC works it in the paint. Left hand. Drive it up and in. Boxing magical with 13th. JC across mid court. I like the decision to put Potter in. It's got a toughness to him. JC's spence on this. That's a rare miss from three. My Richard. Jazz picked up the defense. Down low. Tade him scores. And he'll get a free throw. Fires a pass out the sense of lost off a go. Triple drive. Spin it. Kick it out. Potter. Get it. I like it. My god. Potter. Ticking advantage of minutes. I like it because JC's only attempted to three pointers. But he's got it working in the paint. Tade him. Triple up and in. He goes for 30. But the east is going to be tough too. You know, Boston. Billy Milwaukee. Miami always seems to quit a rink of them thing. The Cleveland depending on the health of Donovan Mitchell, I think. There's lots of feet down there. So, you know, I don't want to either way. I don't care if it's the jazz. I think we're back home. That's a play on. 24. For Derek White. To give it back to White. I'll say that wings been open. That was an air ball by Richard. But the follow untouched goes. How's your. I'm hoping he's as fast. That's right. Dwayne was about that same size. Little Neveer. It put white in 190. Jazz is pulled to within two. Now make it 16 straight. Playing catch now. Pridger Cross is over. Key on day. White open. Up and out. Balls loose. So many has it. Holiday. For free. It's just snowball right now. JC steps back. Behind the three four line. Now blows inside. And lays it in with a left hand. I think that's the way. You mentioned it earlier. They've made them a little different. But you're on the scouting report. I think it's more physical. Back inside for 32. And to your point. 17 at the half. And Key on to just. Pay them against Dunne. He's just playing with the now. He's got 34. He has scored 64 points in the two game series this year with Utah. Yeah, T.O.D. goes home. Now he's up to 35 points tonight. He might want all of the points, right? Well, now 36 after he makes the two. But he's also 8 1 1 2 1 and a half rebounds. And five assists. And it's not easy. As we've talked about. They know each other. Showed Mizzoula in his second year. Will Hardy in his second. Two young coaches in this league.
