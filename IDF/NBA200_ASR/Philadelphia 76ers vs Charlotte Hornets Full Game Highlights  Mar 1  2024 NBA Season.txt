 the team and the team and we are underway here in South Philly on a front. The team has slotted in nicely. Charlotte's starting line-up. That's bridges for three. Bridges more than Katie people once he gets a goal. 37% for Bridges from outside on the team. Bridges just one for seven for Matt's. The one might have been fired up about his first start. Bridges loses his foot and Lowery quickly adds to Matt Siege. Diaries dubs it off to Tobias. It's dead. Ankle looks okay. The position from Toby blocking out. Ornith's 0 for their last six from the floor. Tobias gets a triple. It's a rock fight to start this one out. Richard, confidence is starting to rise. Knocks down another one from the right wing. Like to see it. Another good closeout by Moe, Maxie there as well. Bridges from outside. He goes and curries. A couple of best shooters in the game today. Going toe to toe. Maxie had to get out for that high pass. But it doesn't matter. Because he's Saturday's Maxie. It's going on first quarter. The campaign really good. The embossing on Tuesday. You said it. Really nice. Read off the pass from the man in the offense for the hornets. There's Bert Talon. Go way outside. Annie hits it. And we know that that's where he does the majority of his damage. So when he spots up in that corner, you really got to get a beat and get out there quick. Because he'll shoot over most defenders. Hey, it's right back for your sixers. Dallas, and that is how curry and Williams got up to Charlotte. Tom will come in for both of those guys. Raised in the Charlotte area. Bert Talon's showing us something fading towards him. The ball is moving. The basketball is moving. It's moving. The ball is moving. He's moving. One second. Offensive players. Once they've got a man beat, do not allow him back into play. We're cut for Maxie. And over's falls. Bert Sairees Maxie. Arrival too. Return. Yeah, coming back from me. A certainly help in defense. Devise. Looking for more. 13 first quarter points. Bert Zavias. Here. There's a ball moving. The basketball moving bodies. Moving to be a tough cover. been by Bryce Wigawan. Right over Trayman and Doppis Bertons. Williams lowering the shoulder a bit, getting the friendly roll. No, he has the size of Nico. Never brought the ball down to lower than his waist. Nice cut. And Williams off that great cut, lays it up it in. Off the go screens from Bertons. And Miesich is showing you something. Second great pass, he's made the last time to get it back to the hot hand. Martin step back from the wing. And Cody Martin is true from downtown. It's just a big duet. All right, gets it down to Bamba. Back out to Kyle Tome's and Lowry from outside. I think a lot of people would agree with you there, Taren. Buddy, he'll step through along three. He leaves a chorep of O'Bamba there for the offensive rebound and a hook shot. The Sixers, Born and set a 13-0 run. Sixers punch and back with an 8-0 run of their own here. Richard's going right past Bamba, laying it up and in. I reach average in 25.9 points a game thus far. Bridges tough shots. Shippin' over to Bayern's Harris. Reportedly set to sign that net's assistant GM Jeff Peterson has there had a basketball operation. Another great cut. And a good fine. Harris sucks it down. How about you, Golds for the Sixers tonight? Are you really doing a good job sharing the basketball? Miesich, Spinnie, Bankie, and Hitting? I know Charlotte Ron. Hey, Dimashie. Tyrese, Mashie. Just one of the Sixers need a bucket. Tyrese delivered. It drives the penetrations. That time it was one on one call, one out. Curry. Long two from South Curry and it goes. You know all about that. Maxie, Spinnie, and Hanging leaves a short parade trying to flush it gets it back again. Read up a dead it goes. The third shot the charm. Reportedly set to sign for Lowry and O'Baba. Harris. And Tobias gets the roll 17 and counts it tonight for one two. Harris. Just skip. Just like you talked about a few moments ago. Look up was it Kyle Lowry for three lapses. And he kicks it to a wide open Kyle Lowry in that far corner. And then he goes on to the bottom. Richers. After the drop off from Bridges. It was online. Just a little bit on. Hard and crossing over heels. Coming back to his right. Laying it up and in. He can't hand up on that part in the tempted corner three. Buddy. Downhill. Likes to go left. When he decides to pass up on the three. Curry. Needs it inside to Martin. Shotcluck at one. Martin DePito. Nice turn around by Cody Martin. Got something out of something with it. Now Buddy Tobias and Tyres. All with three threes a piece tonight. Richers around the defense. He couldn't finish but Richard's able to tap it in. Really not happy with our individual defense. Everybody needs to get more pressure on bodies right away. We really have to test their drives. We got to test their physicality every single moment. Tyres Maxi did just that. Paul Reedy gathers. And we'll give it back to Lowry. Maxi step back. Corner three is good for Tyres Maxi. The defender. Four threes and counting for Maxi. Mishich answering right back for the Hornets. Crosswalk. And his arm hope is well been felled. Tobias gets their own 21 and counting. Chish. Over to the gallons. Richers. And a emphatic follow by the game at 84. Two to play in the third. But two. Why at night so far offensively for Cam? Is he not standing mid-ray? 36 in the second. 30, 21, sixers in that third. Lowry the turn round of the elbow. Just enough space to get that. No reverse pivot, reverse drilled. Get that shot off. Mishich. Too easy. Laze it up. And he's everywhere around him. Paul smartly pulls it back out. He could've gone to the cup there. It's dead. Aim finds Reed for the Readerocker. Looking for Perkford Todd. There he is. Takes the dribble side step three. And he's got three more. Four for nine tonight. For Dauvis. I see what she did. And be very careful about saying that. Reed, that spin in the hook shot. Beautiful from Bebopal. Nice little drop start. Reed, lay out there on him. Stay down, Paul. Stay down. 50 fence from Paul Reed. But he needs a better finish for Martin. Cam really. Hey, what's your nice thanks for tuning in to NBC Sports. Philadelphia for this one. He passed from Paul Reed. Good cut from Harris. And a fine finish. Cresson started off the game knocking down jump shots. Which isn't really his forte. But he's been good at it tonight. And that's opened up other things in his game. Bridges. Quick turn. Before Milwaukee eventually pulled away. Defense with this version of the Hornets is better than earlier versions. Oh, what a pass from Paul Reed. The finger up from Maxi. And 10th year for Seth in the association. Of course, undrafted. Not of Duke and his put together. Suncheon. Fantastic career. And Grant Williams. Punishment he has to take though. Before he gets the benefit of the doubt. That's the only worry some part. Valley finds Maxi behind the screen. And Tom Rees knocks down his fifth triple. Each is. Dishy. Scooped to Bridges. British shoot. Shoot to shoot. Bridges fading away. And he and another. They roll it at three. So that's his fifth triple tonight. He's got 25 for this. On an Ato run to bias. Tough turn around on the baseline. And it goes. And then spun quickly to the baseline. Bernardi's to spin on his heels while most guys spin on their toes. Williams left alone and makes the sixers pay. With three to shoot. At the shotcloth. To bias Harris. Oh, massive bucket. It's a big bucket. You're a fourth. What a performance tonight. For Tobias Harris. 10 of those 31. Coming in this fourth quarter. Bridges right back to it. I'm talking about a win here tonight. Got to get it in. And they do. A great man. Turn in the corner. And what a defensive play by Tyrese Maxi. As he elevated and went up to the shot. Maxi got it. And Tobias Harris and Tyrese Maxi. Taking the baton from them in the second half. And finishing this one off. 30 point performance. Thank you.
