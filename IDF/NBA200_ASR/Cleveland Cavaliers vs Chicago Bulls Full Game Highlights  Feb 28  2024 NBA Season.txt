 to win. And again to miss Julia Flowers. I talked to his dad Winston Garland former NBA guard for a lot of teams. Minnesotas, my teammate, Minnesota. And he's going to have to be harder right now, but he wanted to play. Winston who played 500 games in the NBA. Here's Maxter. Here's Maxter. Making a bright where he left off in the final five minutes against Dallas. Deroson, overshrews. That's a matchup you're going to see a lot of tonight. Two different styles based on how much Garland drives and how much Mitchell penetrates. Most of the nice food got passed drumming for the jam late in the clock. It's almost like the Cavaliers or maybe J.B. They're like, hey, this is a team that's disappointed last night. Hold these scores again. Hold these. Over to the start. And Mr. Holy did not with the follow. He's got eight points, more paint points for Cleveland. Struce Mitchell, five, three. Good. Wow. He was guarded that time by IO. Get in the Guchovich mismatch. Allen came over for the double and the Cavs recovered. One of the best defensive teams in the NBA. Number two in efficiency by Minnesota. Maxter played by Guchovich. Nice entry into the post that time. Back to the basket move for Vouch. Got the ball's last seven points coming from inside. We're all living in the outlet of the continuation of the line for three. Vouchovich, motioning to Tyler Ford that he believed it was a traveling violation. We missed mobility right open. There's Garland late in the clock. Those two who try to stick with him. The shake Garland with a touch. Back three. Nice. Little by little. Got the free run. And he jammed it in with Drummond coming over. That's that with Big Dog E. And the last two minutes they stopped the game and she played the way. Big Dog is playing the ball. I'm with you. Well done. There you go. Kobe. Sneaky hops. There's a coral. And transition against Batibu forces him out. With the pass. The bird flies and scores. And the ball goes to the left. And the ball goes to the left. And the ball goes to the left. With the pass. The bird flies and scores. Moles led. Four to three. And nearly going. Look at the lead again. Vouchovich. Vouchie main. Three, Cola. 20 between Vouchovich and Drummond. Both of them have near double doubles in the first half. Garland is in the middle. That is his fourth of the first half from downtown that puts Cleveland back on top. And Lazy Pass from Garland. Took that back. Mitchell. Allen. Oh. Lovely extending. From his fellow big, Allen. There's down there. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Somebody's going to pick up Garland. Hey. Yeah, a little lava. I look like it was going to be a shot for Garland, but it went. Mitchell trying to get going on offense and he fangs down to three. His second of the night. He got extended range. Both him and Garland. He got better off mentally as far as what he's doing with the ball down low. What? Nice drive by Kobe. That's where he got to get back to that change of direction. That was killing teams, especially big guys early on. Garland's coffin corner. Change of direction. He's got to hit the three. And then he's got to hit it. And then he's got to hit it. He's got to hit it. His fifth triple tonight. Oh, that old cook. He's been married and they know it here for a while. A couple of triples now for the team. Truced Allen with the dunk. Got it back to that plant and a little easier that time. He's been playing spits on the attack. Kick it out. Extrabeat. The rose in overweight. Yes. He's got seven in the quarter. White took the spot into a suit move drum and took the spot of Ujavish. Good fun by mostly. And he forces it in against rubber. So much pressure on the knee presser. Yeah, guys die cut like that. Oh, he put the moves on Garland just like he did in Cleveland and one. Oh, wow. Remember Kobe, dance Garland out of his shoes a couple times when these two teams last met. The balls. They have four double figures. But they've had a nice bet. That's a nice play. That's how they ring Garland off of Kobe. Still struggling. Moldley flips it in. Kobe. The bird trying to flip it back out. He was deflected. Five to shoot. The bird will shoot. He's going to roll down on three. Four. His third and the ninth. It'll run. Yep. That punches the lead back up to double digits. The rose in gallops in. Back out. Battee. Sheakes. Float. Scull. Free battee. Free battee. Luchovich against Moldley. Nice ball fake. Nice throw out by Luchovich. Luchovich who's got 16 and 10. And forces. White had to run it down. Luchovich. Dive it in on that with nice three. Go for the work in. The jam. It's going to the basket. Something going to the basket. And not the free throw. Quick down. The Coral drives into white to finish. The Coral is six foot five elevating high. 25 points to lead the cast. The Coral drives. Coral drives blocked by the rose in. The defense by the mar. 4.5 on the shot clock. And the second by the way. Shot clock is on. You have to prepare for you. Oh, Mitchell knocked it away. And the Rose in covers it. A chance for the win. Got to go. Got to go. Got to go. Six left. It's the Rose in. Tomorrow. For the win. He did it. No. Up to overtime. We go. White. Looking for Boots and Steps kicks for no sooner. Yes. Go. Well, he started to heat it up in the four, but two now, so free is the defense. The team guards the rope. It is streused with a contested three to tie the game. His first. He goes to Moot trying to stick with Mitchell, but it's up here to switch with Boots and Steps. The Rose in covers the game. The guy who's not shot the ball great this year, but as Stacy mentioned, he's dealing with injury early. Boots and Steps. Spinning. I'm opening. Got to go. Two games for six minutes, but he garbage time. This is a real debut. He had to lead the ball to score. So that opens up the rope again, and the Bulls are out of rotation for another trip. Here's Don't Sooboo. That was both of an offense. He's got 11 points. Mitchell sees the block. Goal's four. And scores again late in the game when you need a bucket. No matter how quiet he's been at 8.30. Bulls down four. The Rose in drives. And scores. Good ball again, but 21 seconds left. Time to 115. Three seconds left. It's got an initial. That's off it. For the lead. No! Don't over time. He got away with a push off too. He pushed off on Kobe, and he called it, but he got away with the one. White. Against LaFont. Fakes the three. The Rose in drives it and stands. And passes it on. Good ball. The Marvellous, the Rose in. Needs help. Here's the Rose in the three. There we go. Forces the three. Yeah! Oh! You need a big bucket. Find the veteran in the Rose in. Dosomo. Four-hander. Big time. Big time. Big time plays. Big time plays. On his 24-3, Bob, the night. Mitchell kicks Laverne. 70 seconds left. The team on defense. Dosomo challenges. It's a big three. You're really deep there. Deep into the archives. Mitchell. Oh, he's three. Three is good. And this is only a four-point game. Four-point. Yeah, sure. And after the balls. It's 26-revice. It's 26-revice. 74. And a night after the ball. It's 26-revice. It's 26-revice. It's 26-revice. It's 26-revice. It's 26-revice. It's 26-revice. It's 26-revice. It's 26-revice. It's 26-revice. It's 26-revice. It's 26-revice. It's 26-revice. It's 26-revice. It's 26-revice. It's 26-revice.
