 You ready? You game? I'm game. And what people think Pacis made a terrific trade. This is this is a big time guy I think. And Nimhard tips in his own minute one. To the buyoff of it. Second turnover running is white. And a much better start for the polls. On the glass pretty easy. Pacis with 50 fast break points on the road trip. And that's a basket counted for Derosa. Alabama finds McConnell who gets inside and it rims out, put in by Toppen. And a deal on the box. Just 16 in the first half. McConnell starts the offense gets to the basket and put it in and falls the foul. Derosa inside. Oh boy here. Turner's looking for the block shut on the light side. Find this hit. Don't get it from you got to go get it from you. Yeah, there you go. You got to sit around there trying to make a plate. You're in fish with a little hammered up. Walker staying out there. Skit pass. Knee Smith passes too high. Couldn't do much with it. Didn't write thing. Get it out. Stop and go. Palabrton to the basket. Put it in. Really nice job. Got by a piece of bitch. Defits came late on the other side. Yeah, 29 of their 49. Catching is Turner and he pounds it all. Recognition in the bucket. He kicked it. He kicked it. Aces just led by 11. That lead is seven. Derosa leaves it off for Caruso hits the three. Two derosa. Caruso hit that three and another one. And it's a one point game. First half 60 to 49. See the patient's a puts the eye on him. Can't the basket and a five. They let that go as well. Yeah, they let it play on a big way. A 43 on the way by Caruso. That's why I was talking earlier in the first half. That's why I'm looking to see can you get to the bucket. TJ showing them how to make a three-pointer. And the thing you can't do is make three-pointers. And there's Caruso for a three-pointer. Caruso for a fifth. No. Oh, it goes in. Fights for the rebound. Walker got it. Keppitla. Shepherds for three. There he is again. There he is again. See how come. Makata with the steal. And the Pacers cut it to six. Go, foul. Go, foul. B-10. Banks it in. 16 more. The Pacer pitch has been terrific. See how come with a chance for an end one. Literally just throwing up in the timeout. I didn't know that you do it, but it was really fine. Everybody was looking for Crowley. Smith for three. Tata. Off a see-off and smooth in the middle. He once said against B. Tim. He's been wanting it the whole time. The rookie actually is a rookie in the NBA, but you can tell he's a veteran player. That's not big of a... Get the pace of the two-pointer. And his third double-figure game of the year. Off the glass white with a circus shot. Two-man game. Right there. Now, Hannah Bird. This time, Nees Smith got it. That was a big bucket. Let's say something. First miss from three for Caruso. He had made his first tie. Turner got caught out. Wait a minute, it's by Miles. And Tbore Craig hits it, beating the ball. And Tbore Craig hits it, beating the shot clock. You raise it to double if you have to. Oh, God. I'll tell you what. Don't count the best. Sheree Mitchell saying no, it's on the floor. After review, the first legal contact is caused by the Rosen hook in the armor, Nacemet. Therefore, the count is by Indiana. We'll be successful. Indiana will retain his timeout. And he will also retain his count. Indiana ball sign out. Oh. That's the second one he's done that too. And it's a three-point lead. But the second time he's still a pass. The Subaru. The driver. And he got it. I hope the Subaru. Extra pass, Turner for three-point. Tied. Mickles Turner. Alabama Burton, the Turner. Here's another. Do you believe again? Yes! Hits again! Yeah! He's here. He got it in the head of a five-second ten. Don't go for the hit. Don't follow me. Derose it. That's right. You play some of the differences. That's okay. White is there. Out to NEMHAR. Here's a three. NEMHAR. No good. Rebound. Peace is ball. Here's a NEMHAR for three. That and out. Hope you like. Got it. It's not from Guter. Yes! Can we get saved? Yes! What a relief. I'm going to get saved. I'm going to get saved. I'm going to get saved. I'm going to get saved. I'm going to get saved. I'm going to get saved. I'm going to get saved. What a relief. Yeah! See Yacke makes that get over play to get to save. And he Smith hits the first. Well standing. Two big free throws by Neesmith. And Russo and Bounce. They need a three to top. Derose. I didn't want to follow them in the shot. They want to follow them early. And he is perfect and belong. Yeah, he missed it all perfectly. Chipped out of there but. That's that ball. Yeah. Two seconds. They have no timeouts. Oh my goodness. No. No. He made it. It's harder than made it on a tough turn around. The Marga Rosen. Hey, without a break. They've got Torey Craig in. Derosen. And the Bulls have a lead. Yacke got his hands on him. Here's Miles for three. He is third. Deruso. Go, go. Go back to the field. He's going to get the ball. He's going to get the ball. He's going to get the ball. He's going to get the ball. He's going to get the ball. Go back to the field. You see it. No. Are you giving him that? I'll hold this. The more importantly for the Bulls, they have a two-point lead. Turner. Another three. Pinson, number three. Derosen. Shot clock at eight. He's going to pull up for three. Derosen has 45. Reach a pitch. And it's a four-point lead. They're getting out the Turner quickly. Alabama Burton loops it in. Game number ten for the Bulls. They won six times. He's going to ten. He's going to ten. Michael T. He was revving up. Plenty of time. Pacers have gotten two three-point field goals from Turner. Got the whole middle. And at the rim, laying it in, C.O.C. There will be no time. Perusal. And it's put in by Craig. The double-in-the-hand, Perusal in the middle. Here's Haliburton. Pacers taking some time. Haliburton gets inside. Put it up. And C.O.C. But we've got a foul. We've got two. It's the first. They'll take a time out of the mix. It's a spec. Haliburton makes it both two-point game. Bill, it pays the ball. They lob it over the top. And now the Pacers foul. What they did. Let's see how the Pacers defend it. Instead of setting the screen, he just came out. He got the ball. He is 14-15 as you see at the three-tool-on. Perusal said they're going to come out. What's it going? Mist it. They will not take the time out. Here's Nimhor. Turner. Pacers with three seconds. Haliburton. Sure. Thank you.
