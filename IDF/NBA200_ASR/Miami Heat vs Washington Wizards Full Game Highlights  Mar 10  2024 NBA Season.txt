 You ready? You game? I'm game. Tonight, guys. Thank you, Kelly. Let's transition right into the start of tonight's game. Our officials are Brian Forte, Natalie Zago, who will abolish the rookie starting at center in place of the interim Rashon Holmes. This is Kyle Kuzma, spinning on Butler. Got all the way to the basket. It's one for nine in OK, soon. Just six for his last 24 for the field. Kuzma, now Kispert for three. That's good. That's one way to get, Volody. You don't have to have a play call for you. If you're banned, you're so affidavit. You're so affidavit. You're so affidavit. You're so affidavit. You're so affidavit. You're so affidavit. You're so affidavit. You're so affidavit. You're so affidavit. You're so affidavit. You're so affidavit. Oh, he mix up defensively. He had a layup for Corey Kispert. He's ducking on the offensive glass to flick it away, but Butler has. Rosie, pull back now attack. Oh, he got by Kula Bali for the score. Washington looking for just their second two game winning streak of the season. He had on the shot clock for the heat. Nice entry by Yovic. Bam with a score. Johnny Eddysman. Tyas Jones. Tyas Jones at a duke nine year better. And Diya with a right hand slam. He's having his best year career. He's trailing by three. Yovic, a corner three. Bam, I'm a 10. Bam, second try. Jams are through. Jordan Pull with a new role of the Wizards coming off the bench. And it has played well for him, whose spinning middle. Now Pull with the open three. He comes out of there with Caleb streaking in. Bam slamming it home. Bam out of bio. A couple of them. This is half dea. A tacking Duncan Robinson for the score and the foul. They're undersized in there. He's taken advantage. He'd have been able to find him and he's been getting off the glass. A second on the shot clock and Robinson connects from downtown. That was here. He's behind his back. Setting up our heads. He'd close that by Landry Shabbat. Our heads take them right to the house. And what was a frustrating loss? He felt like they were in position to win both at Dallas and OKC. And they'd do it on either night. Butler mid-range turn around. He'd on a 12 to three run now, dating back to the first quarter. Pull on the baseline for the jam. It's 40 Eastgate. Make a contact with the elbow there. It really looked like it was a glancing situation. I have to ask Patrick Baldwin's draw. Kuzma able to drive in and score seven points plus a free throw coming. Butler shaken and baked him. Oh, I had a block from behind by Kyle Kuzma. Pull, losing it to Martin. Three on one break. Hackez slams it through. You make sure every down comes Ganna Hackez. He pretty much holding the Wizards to one shot now. Oh, off the glass! Butler puts it in. Not an air in line. Wow. 13 points in that last game against OKC. An equally important took a charge. Just fit right in on both ends of the floor offense and defense. Mills escapes for the score. And D on the run, missed it. Occurally in Kisbert. It looked like he carried it out of bounds. Bam comes away with it. He's crossing over to the paint. To the basket. And man, instead of fouled through, it's staying on the line there. We eat stays at seven for the heat. Four minutes left in a half. That's an uncontested dump. We'll see you guys a few minutes from now. We've got 3-18 left in a half. Terry Rozier adding on all around solid games. That is just where he's going down, grinds it down. I think the other thing he said when you asked him that question as we see Rozier, not another one. He should in 51% though in the head. Dias Jones, a win jumper that drops. Shot clock down the seven for Bam against Javier. To his sweet spot. Oh, patience. And for six. And to play in a little sloppy. Duncan made the wrong read there. He had the right hand runner tried to throw it up top for Bam for a lot. Should have taken that one himself. Kisbert. Oh, that was from this nine attempts. Good work though. Moving constantly moving, coming off a curl cut. Wide open for Kyle Kuzma. Got past one defender in there. Was no help. Franslash, you know that. That brought a lot of eyes to him. Oh, the slam for Jimmy Butler. An opportunity here where you're just exchanging baskets with this wizard's team. That's how they play. Super aggressive offensively. You know, almost let's just score. You got to dig in on the defensive. Already for my. Oh, it's Duncan Roberts. It's four turnover results in a quick score. He'd have 42 points in the pain. Butler has 15 Kuzma. Sky walking and scoring and drawing a foul on Bam. It's got 16 points in this game. The lob in the slam. Bam crushed it. This shot taken down by Rosy here with a heat ahead by four. Terry pedal to the metal. Yes. Rose here is instant offense for the heat. He's got it doesn't. He little four to one assists turnover ratio since the trade that brought him here from Charley. Kulma Bali. Knocks in his second three of the night. Guy had 26 points a season eye against Miami. The last time these clubs met. Oh, what a play. Let's take a three. And the long rebound and kiss. Pull from deep. Oh, the deep end of the pool. Former assisted with the nets, the thunder, the lakers and this. Go, bitch. Oh, able to drive in and complete the play. Peter shooting 52 percent in the game. They now rebound of the Wizards by seven. Baldwin crashing in. It will count. And the foul is against Patty Mills under the basket. At three point play gives an eight points tonight just two away from his season high. Tied at 84. Martin on the ties. The Jack Knife triple for Caleb Martin. Nine minutes to play. No pitch to his left to the lane for the runner and the foul. Out to Jimmy for a three. He missed it. Kusma pull up three in transition. He makes. Kisberg surrounding. Kulma Bali left Frank. And he drains a three. Kusma. Rolled off. Thank goodness. Jimmy butler down with a rebound. Wizards on an 801. Butler on the move. Lacing in. He the defense right here.
