 You ready? You game? I'm game. Could be a ton of fun. So looking forward to that, looking forward to this game rocket back at home for a pair of one here against Washington. Another one on Saturday against the Cavaliers before the rockets head back to DC. Take on these wizards again. I'll say one thing, I'm excited coaches mind up because he does so much talking to the young rockets about. Wow, that was a very nice way. I'm going to do that early at office. There was money into Jones. And that three goes down from Pittsburgh. He's going to look for those catching shoot three point opportunities. You want to be there. Down low again. This wizards team arguably. Family right down the middle. Again, a man initially unable to hang on to it. Got it back. Miss patches three times a single. You don't want to get comfortable. Hey, attack with force. It's also respect. Get the game over with early. You're not committed to playing or defending. You know, take advantage. Younger brother, Trey Jones of the Spurs and Taya's not sitting down. Taya is having the best offense for teams of the Sparrari. They're going to be able to free in and get what two more points within about two inches of the realm. Take it two shots and he's come away with two airballs. Dylan Brooks, the leader of the E-Squars, is 10-7. He used it all 10 of their points in the maids. You love that from Dylan Brooks. Doesn't play around. Gets contact. Go to the ramen. Finishes. Good cut. Good find by Taya's Jones for the off-stuffer. Up to time out with Milwaukee's two, the Bucks also. Yeah, it was right after us, on the second out of a back to back. Here comes the Statue of Liberty slam. Right now that's not it. Keep attacking the maskies. You have not been stopped in the weaknesses inside. Kuzma is the Rockets. It's a miscommunication. Deeds to the rim. So, yeah, that was some Matador deed. What? Well, it there by four. The challenge is don't get too cute. Keep attacking. Stay consistent. That one in the lane goes down to Kuzma. Damn, bleak. Can't get off the three. Good job by Jones. Down to Landel. And the off-stuffer. Don't back there by a men's toss. He's been unbelievable. It's doing his job. Cool. From the slot knocks down the three. I play for the Wizards. They don't take the chances. I trick everybody with that. They don't know it. Landel, deep two along the baseline. I'll be in the get-bird. Turned back by Smith. Shock locked out to five. Not a four-one on one by holiday. Makes another three. His second. They have to raise those mindless turnovers. You've got to play much cleaner basketball. That'll count. And he got fouled. He's going through all the way for number five. Rebounded to Larry Smith Jr. Back to him. Trails and shoots. Fakes. And the Rockets have a double digit lead. 13 to four on. I think it's been a second. Don't hold me on it. I'm not holding back. You're right. I think you're wrong. Good. Pocket pass. Hey! Pull it down. Take Mama. Throw it down. He's on the hot hand here. No, Dave for ten. He's got 16. He's only just five of their 17 shots in this corner. Goes up. Now you don't want to be complacent on the other end. All right. They're doing a tap at the frisky top. Goes to top. To the land. They're picking a frisky. Beautiful basketball. They're sharing the sugar. Six fourths straight on the road. I sound like playing an all-my-gave up that 20-point lead with a footer. So they're trying to prevent that as... You have knocked it down along the baseline. You need to hear me. Work quick. Please, kiss with the top trouble. It gets the bounce there. Brim backboarded down through. It's fired on the tree. And Fred makes that. The seconds got 14 now. Just eight. Keep with it. Casual was a slam in the face of Smith by Obdaya plus the foul. Seven games for Obdaya coming in. About 16 turn. That's what he has here. The face that goes down for Smith. Rockets were up by as many as 20s. The bar does a good job paying it all. He'll be right by Thompson. The Rockets have scored seven straight after the... That start to the corner, pulling up for free. The hatch for Fred Van Blink. Fred gets it. Take care of business to start the half. Because you should be touching the floor in the fourth quarter here tonight. And again, Matthews hard making a 24-point lead. I was like, I know that's not a 22-point lead, but this came out of my mouth. My apologies. Green down the baseline. Alps, dressing for the right hand. Had a step in. Also got the score. Thompson on the move. Turned back by Obdaya. Here comes Green, shock lock. He down. Goes to the left. And he got it up just in time. He's been driving hard to the left all night long. And easy for Jones. And that makes Emea Doka not very happy. I think if you go all the way back to the offseason and try to determine whether or not this group with where they had bent you. You can play by Jail Grants too, but it's still beautiful. Very frustrating. It should be an easy call there. Do got to give Kisbert some credit. There's four other teammates for ball watching. Still hungry. Play. And ever was jibble. It's crazy how you respond. It's feel like Jailin is really focused on this little thing. It's ending, rebounding, getting the flexion, positioning. Lock it with 100 on the board. Feel better than three minutes ago on the third quarter. Pull back. Pulled back. Pulled jumper. Good. That's just close as man out of position. And it's a wide open layup. It's very easy for Green. Oh, pirouette. Pull and score. That was nasty. I'm going to go two things for him these days. Got a goal. Big, big, big, big, big. And then, dude, overwimpy the other night. Pulls feeling it now. That was a great contest from Dylan. Oh. He just lost Budlamp. Go! Jailin Green in the local way. That was a great contest from Dylan. Oh. He just lost Budlamp. Go! Jailin Green in the local way. He made the right way to the Magic Wall and one of them was flying. You're going to see that one for a while. Pulls stay side. Looked out of the state. Terrific play on that made three Van Blee. Short. All right. Here's Butler on the attack. And dunk back in. And look, the rockets need to lock in. They'd like lost to 20 point lead. The last time they were here, as obvious beats the buzzer. He's got a really good year. This is not over. Still a lot of basketball left to be played. And they do have the wizards. Many talented offense players, including Pools, want to chuck up three rockets or are no better than the wizards. It just shoots three. But if you get to the ramp, the bullet's with the right gloves. Jailin Green goes down that three. Both teams actually shoot the identical percentage from three. And the man tops the rockets defensively should be really good. Well, I'm saying the guys are good. You're missing right now. Yeah. Who's the most? They got numbers. And there goes Ty's Jones. And this is the layup. Take the rebound. And three on one. And came away with nothing. Jailin Green from the corner. Jailin Green from the corner. 37 now. A new season high. Oh, my gosh. Man, please. Oh, my goodness. Who's the most? Who's the most? Who's the most? Man, Thompson. The ropes to land down. I never saw pool. The lead got switches to the left hand. And they were able to score. Oh, no. Oh, no. The one is all right. Buckle. Hop back up. The bar is set to lock the Thompson. They're going to have to feed the timer. They're going to get on the off the board. I guess we're back at ball. Whatever. It's first time I'd ever played. It was fun. Yeah, it was terrible. Catch your back, Gov. And it goes top. Thompson. It's a double four. It made it top to 20 and 10. Take the tape. Got foul. It'll shoot one. Now winners of six of seven and proved to 31 and 30. Thank you.
