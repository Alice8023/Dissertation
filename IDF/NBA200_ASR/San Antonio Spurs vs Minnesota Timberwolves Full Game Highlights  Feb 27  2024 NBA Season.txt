 You ready? You game? I'm game. Not a lot. It's not happened a lot. No. Since the early 70s, my tragedy of 3 is the show clock wise down. Sometimes it's still okay to triple out. You know, you don't have to always get to the basket or force the issue. You cut that time by Champaigney from the corner. Under 10 on the shot clock Anderson driving on Champaigney missed it but the follow slam. That's going to be the key because when Minneapolis is going to go up to blocks, Rudy Lopez can be right there. When he doesn't block it, Rudy's going to be there for the back and want to spin move on the baseline. He's averaging about three more points a game and Edrick averaging a couple more rebounds a game and with the blocks or about one block clicking, there's nothing but... It comes to the goals the other way. You know, this is spectacular play for Libby Niam. Here's a pull off from Edwards. Got it. First... We'll begin the back. Showing off the handle. Gonna step back. Top three, slish. Wow. Defensive effort. Saddle for the rest of the game. Edwards three more. Morris going it up. Struggling to contain the ball gives it up to the cell. Bricking on the three rebound Edwards. Quickly ahead. Nas Reed. Yerrow slam. Under two minutes to go. Edwards. Rana Go Bear Scrain. Driving going reverse. Pretty Go Bear and Mike Conley both. Edwards to the rim. He's in double figures with ten. And a super computer defensively. Wolves on the run again. Behind the back in traffic. Edwards got it back and finished. Barely now. 10 and the Minnesota went on a 19-8 or on the rest of the quarter. Conley for three. So we were talking about this last game. Three. And off to Go Bear. Go Bear. Spitting no way. The back in the slam. It is Grille. Take that Richard. Oh, dreading the needle. Beautiful feed from Wemma. Daniels on the drive. Pick something's dribbling. Reads in a Go Bear Scrain. Little fake short hook goes down. Four. Who's playing faster in this game? Best for a break points. Tell a story. 12-3, Vanisher Minnesota is going to Jonson. Knocks down the corner. It's kind of hard to have a good end out dribble if you don't have a good cross over. First, my cross over dynamic. Here's McLaughlin for three. Come on, J-Max. And half possession. Shot clock winding down. J-Max again. Splash. Four. This is the Spurs team that drops four in a row. Collins short hook falls. Depart. Grisel. Oh, nice finish. And works on the drive. Go's off window for two. I feel like Ant is not complaining as much as he has in the past. He might give him a look and he might even ask for a call. And the Hay is still going to be there. Go Bear with the quick hands. Collins, hit a three on the last possession. Jons hanging and an old fashion three point play opportunity. Conley on the drive. Take in the contact. No call. And Conley the Peevery and the Lay. Off the dribble. Get squared up and use two feet to go up strong. Oh, wow. That was effortless. This T-5 point grab. But Sal rejected by Edwards. So we did not get back in bounds to secure the ball. Frito line. He's tough a little bit of everything. But Sal kick out. Boss Minan is strong first. I get that out of here. Jons will hit Baycan got the land. Against the Lakers. The five blocks, you know, the block can't agree. He's been topnating his knives. Gets another one inside. He has ten points off the bench. Edwards attacking. And got it the full. He has twenty seven. The cells stripped on the way to the cup. Spurs have turned it over twenty times. Knows raid. Bucket. And the five. Number one defense in the NBA. Group all aspects of his game. Still a great two point shooter. Reminiyama. First field goals. The lob. Reminiyama slaps it out of there. They're back chasing it down. Edwards. Three ball corner pocket. Fifty fifty ball winner. Oh, cookies. Highlight. Don't read. Cross over. Painted training. Left hand. Those spurs. They're looking a little bit depleted right now. This is the tonight's game for them. That rodeo road trip always happens around all-star break. As Jody Osmond is having a heck of a game. He's one of those guys that is such a great decision maker. He's a great cutter. He's a great mover of the basketball. Oh, it's going to meet teacher. I wasn't ready to pull it back out of the ball. You're going to sneaky with your outerwear too, by the way. You've got a pretty nice arsenal yourself. Conley. Go bear. And the steal by Devon Vicell. Breakaway opportunity. And the flush. It's going to rough shooting night for Devon Vicell. But he's been widely inconsistent lately for the first. Conley. Another from downtown. Seven in the NBA. His three point bill gold percentage. And he's climbing up that ladder. You're five years on rating two. That's under heart. James, even a match. This is not 50 years. It's a release. Johnson in the corner for three. Special season. It's been filled Park Targets Center 90 to 90 out of his party. Read working on Osmond Devon 22. No matter who Minnesota plays either. I could be in San Antonio. People were so psyched to watch. I'll be the only one to play in the San Antonio's first team. No matter who they play. I mean, like, and Memphis is playing their butts off too, by the way. They are playing hard for Taylor Jenkins. Love to go bare. Morris on the drive. Check out McLaughlin. Got a three. And the hilarious part of that position. We have Minimum finishing the lob. He's now over five for V. Good struggling with that shot lately. Johnson. Got another triple. Alexander Walker on the attack. Can't finish. Wemba Niamma the other way is 11-3 behind the game. Now Malayne and Mayne. He could have dunked that with his elbow. Vicell got it. 12-point game. The cell. Got three for another three. It's an 11-point game. Jones lost it. Edwards. Give it it back to McDaniels. Got the lay in his first field goal. And the lay pull-up rolls out. Go bare. Blocked by Wemba Niamma his fourth of the night. Outside and up. A plow from this target. Cinnacrow. Edwards rejected by Champ Penny. Champ Penny running the floor and throws it down. Sembalo 4's 23 turnovers. Leade by his many is 24. And they hold on for 114-105.
