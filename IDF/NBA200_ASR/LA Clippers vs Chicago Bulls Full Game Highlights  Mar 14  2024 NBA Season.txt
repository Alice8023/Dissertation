 I'll get one to one. You ready? You game? I'm game. My bad moves are time. I'm going to go home. I'm going to go home. Start of the season. I'll tell you what, that look extremely bad. Yeah. I'm just so glad that he was able to walk off and he's showing a little bit more. I so- Leonard is back after missing the second half on Tuesday against Minnesota. Ruchovic, where are you? So lots with the jumper. And they can attack him some last night. There's the double under Roseanne and Highland steps in front of Ruchovic. Here is Drew, Drew, the first Clipper 2. You saw there coming a double tomorrow. Anytime he has this. Six in the league in a sys per game. Coruso knocks it away from Highland late in the clock. Tested for a wild world's Highland. That's a tough shot. He knocked it down. Right. He's there. Since he came back, Vitcher. George got the hand on it when those sumo was going up. Man, this time. Oh, Kawaii, just the one hand in the clock. Showing it off in its 11. You can see the spot for the floor. Coruso in the corner. Space more crowd. Great, great, great. Alex Coruso has had the best three-point shoot in. Good as long. No man. The team to Coruso, Sam Spots, Sam Spots. Coruso shot again. Table for three. Reservation of his crew. Such a similar game in that mid-range. The groups they go to. The Rose is trying to stick with George. Just enough separation for the lengthy ball, George. I'll show you. You should correct myself. The crew didn't ask him officially. What is his pronunciation yesterday? Let her it again. Oh, wow. That is Coruso's yelling out the directions. Those sumo doubles. Coruso on Powell. Boss George. But 10 for the game over. But George hits again. 10 points for George. Which of it, Joe? Joe goes. Daniel Tyce. Kick out. Go, sumo. Coruso. Good. Give him an eye sauce. I owe. The long police. Oh, you got to get that rebound. He got the offense aboard instead for LA. And George catches him. Boy, George and Leonard. Red, hot to start. They're a combined 11. We have 25 and 33 points. Deep one. That goes to him. Oh, boy. Going back to back. He's shot not going down cleanly last night. His presence is very important. We're being a witch. Collide, Leonard just flips it in. Fuck you. Right, guards George. Hot to the screen. Switch with the sumo. Whips it inside. Powell, they lost. Coruso and Powell, Audrey. Coruso. He's the one. That's it. That's it. He got matched up with Brandon Boston. Powell, it's a coffee. Set it up to knock it down. Near coffee, Alpinot. Yannis pulled that 30-attenticist each. And the loss against Minnesota. Tuesday. Ty's gets it to go. Ty's his first points of the lead. Not going to go. Coruso and Carter. Coruso, nobody picked them up. So he hits it. Rocha, that is eight floppy now. Deroson, swings through. And lagging tight. Swim. Zubat's taps it back out. Another chance. Boston. Why it's rummaged with hop and a chance. Boston challenged him at B.J.S. In Luchovich. Go Sumu Carter and Craig. Five for the balls. Jabbana Carter. He winds it up. Mr. Carter. Bang, bang, bang. We're right behind him. Did I see Leonard watching Deroson? Carter. Again. There you go, Basie. We've talked about this all year. Ben. He's capable of getting high. Oh, there is switch. You got to switch. Do you see? The lacquer communication. That's the team between those two guys. Seven for a colline. Four for B.J.S. The series is like having two black down. Carter. We talked about this time. That was his compass one. It's seconds left for the half. He is. Here he comes. And he slips through. That's not an easy way to catch the rim. But Ben, he's got to hit it too. Final seconds. I'll bet has for colline letter. Oh, my gosh. Colline hangs at four. Wow. Sixteen. A game high. Chorges down. I barely went down. Chorges down by the gorge. I had to say that. Seriously. Oh, man. Paul George continues to keep it high. I don't know if I can get in the end of the day. I'm in the end. He was going to sing it out. There you go. That's cool. That's cool. You're going to definitely. He's going to sit there. I'm going to do a little bit. I'm going to do a little bit. That's four for Krones at a night. You know, that kind of solidifies it for me. Let it open. It's Clipper lead is not be surprised if you see the lake. The lake is right. The lake is right. Clipper just recently. The Rose and gets the field all there. They can roll opportunities and they can't get it. The lake is in the third quarter. I think it's 12 points in the third. And they came with Jay Tarr. That's today you mentioned it the other night. Well right on cue. There he is. With Jay Tarr. He gets the ball. He gets it. But Tim, extra feet. Go soon. Overzoots. Yes. They need to get I.O going a little bit. Go, go, go, go. Not a good pass. Peruso. Go read by Highlander picket. The line. He went to the best. That's going to be it. Tim trying to get back on letter. Peruso. Good job by reading it. Oh, the Turkish hammer. Again. What a distance. Highlander. The Thai Street. This is for you. Slow down. All day. For three. Oh, what a rebound by Drummond. Powering it back. Go. That's where it is. The man's game. No boys left. The man's game. The man's game. The man's game. No boys left. There is four years with Cleveland. And four seasons with the Clippers is headband. Top block. The Rosehan. The high archer in the rim. On lettered. The Rosehan Helmagan. The man. Good. Carpides. Highlander. See that time they weren't connected defensively. Get out of that corner against the man. Spreads the baseline. Peruso to Boots of it. Throwes it to Peruso. Double big line up in there. Double big line up in there. Double big line up in there. Double big line up in there. Double big line up. Good high low pass. That's it as much of this double big line up. Bulls must think out tonight. The four. But Tyce gets the rebound. Kicks it back out. Yes. Then he's got to come over that loose ball. Get back. Peruso trying to keep an eye on George. Yeah. It's the three. He can't beat that low. He can't beat that low. He's got to come up. The Rosehan. Man's. It's the lock. The Rosehan. The Rosehan. The Rosehan. The Rosehan. He's finding a little bit of energy in this score quarter. Oh. The Root should get George gets the space to the other side. Good move by Bruce. Up and on to E-Cloud on his way. Yeah. Good adjustment by Donovan. For wide. He got the separation he needed. Paul George, the LA native who was able to call me. Back out for George. It's that time of night for Paul George. 10-11 from the field. Five of six from three. 25 points for George tonight. Peruso. Bam, bam, bam. All right. He got to give it to him. Highland Dancin shooting. Wow. Man, I tell you, he just kind of screwed it up. I had a assist and he hits a big. Down the floor because he has to guard him on the defensive end. He's taking the defensive playout. Hey. Good position by Donovan. Got the matchup. Oh, man. Paul was able to recover. Wow. What a pass. All the way across the court. Man, it's been like Paul George cannot miss. And he's only done more. Big shots. He's got a ridiculous flip. Leonard. Every ball with a block. Again, these two. George and Leonard with a hearted man in the year voting. Here comes Deylin Terry. Oh, nice. Look at Terry. Little drag step. So again, he's been in 54 seconds. You know, they got to come in on Saturday. And that's got to be a win. Well, now the schedule is up a little bit. So this ends like a radical. It just comes Terry. Put the moves. Nice pass. Terry Taylor. Well, this goes to the end. Please, no. Henry. We want the part. Gotta have it. The earth is in the turn of gravity. Yeah. The turn of gravity.
