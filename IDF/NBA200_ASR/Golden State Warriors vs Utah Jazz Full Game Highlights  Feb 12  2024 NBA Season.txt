 The Warriors are going to spend a lot of this week in the city by the great Salt Lake, taking on the jazz tonight and Thursday. Theante George with Colin Sexton, Walker Kessler, Tom Collins and Larry Markenay. Blake Thompson opens with the three of his own. Anything you can do I can do better. Colin Sexton down the lane to put it up an end. So a lot of their pain points come off of those drives as a little ball screen is Clay Thompson beats everybody down the floor. That's what you want to do. Kaminga is like, where is Walker Kessler before I think about going to the rim? Raymond three and if those go, then Kessler really is bit twigs to between. Sexton? You see the cut. That's what I told you. Time that's Kessler. It's seven, one, moving pretty good. And then Kessler gets back to block Kaminga's shot. You always have to know where he is. Kaminga used a pump fake that time and then exploded up for the finish. And Wiggins, he was waving for the ball. I ran the floor. Andrew from the baseline. Make marketing guard. Omega sees a C. I mean, what to send it down and Colin's met him up top. GP two likes that corner three and that's perfectly done. Oh, Goat Guard glory market. And our lorry market. I mean, from guys that are six feet tall to seven feet tall and then Wiggins, defense on one end of the three on the other. Jordan Clarkson, you know what? His first shot to go down. He is spree key and he can score and function. You almost feel like you have to just shoot it way up in the air. The jamsky floats at high off the glass. What is going on? The jamsky rhythm dribble for three and he got it. Uh. Colin's rolling in on the pick and roll there. Utah executed perfectly. Step for the side step three. Yeah, he's not going to keep missing those by the way. Play took it to trouble. Taylor and Horton Tucker with the steal. This is what he likes to do. He can drive and finish. Horton Tucker. Yeah. That's what he does. Taylor and Horton Tucker let him a little too much. The jamsky. What a confidence stroke on that three. He's feeling good. You could make the case. Brandon's one of the top five picks in this draft and he was selected 19th as Clarkson. He is something laid aloony. Kessler changed that shot. Come on. Fighting for it. Got it to Kaminga. Open three and he got it. That was a big shot. And that will end it as Kessler blocking Kaminga. The Warriors did not shoot a free throw the entire quarter. Kessler is loud about his shot blocking. We got three in the first quarter and a half against Kaminga. That's everybody in the basket. Kessler is going to jump. Taylor and Horton Tucker float now on. Not going to call you airfix. Taylor and Horton Tucker, how would you guard him? I mean, he hit the one fade away but everything else has been going to the rim. Jordan Clarkson is just that good. That is stellar footwork. Markson is that hot. He's got 13 as yet to miss a shot. You know what? Markin and his start coming alive. So Jazz in rhythm. Walk the Warriors down. Step all the way to the rim to lay it up and in. Not surprisingly, the Jazz having more success in the paint with Jack. Right there. Markin and finishing. He got something out of that Don Mimitzel trait. What a pass from Sharj to Clay. Sharj has been doing some work with his vision of top. Markson pulled those sticks into a three. He is something else. Mimit denied Clarkson able to save because five of 15 from distance. GP2. And Steph finds Gary perfectly. He was just running. Steph went goggles on a match with that GP2 and he went back to GP2. And that is a goal 10. He had the cap and then he had the hamstring. Nice feed to Markin and can't tell you George with the delivery. He's just limiting penetration. Dremont scoring over Collins. Like this aggressive Dremont. Steph will never be more open than that. And that rhythm dribble kept them in rhythm. Sexton driving. Has deflected over to Brandon. Attacking with Kessler. Try to get it back to Dremont. He did. How nice was that? Took the shot blocker with them. Got Dremont on layup. I'm talking go to for one. Sexton realizes and pulls 25 seconds away from Dremont getting a half time without picking up that four and a foul. And it's so critical for the second half. Steph with the wing jumper. Markin in will firing. How about that? Wiggins and Steph. A second to work with Dremont. A running third. We made any listers at home. That's perfect. Everybody else just kind of stopped. Dremont was like, you know what? I see an opportunity here. Let me see if I can blind this one up. Dremont. Three fouls in the first five minutes. But played the whole rest of the half and then set that par. Hinder Wiggins by the way. Plus 18 best players in the game. You ended to have so well and you have momentum now. George gets screened. And Dremont Green is sending some monster screens. Camingo. A shot blocker, Mick. I'm not a wrestler. It's something else. He's always there to help. Aren't they going to be cold all night? I don't think so. We started three of 11. Dremont. Let's look into the big man and scores over Kessler. Did K go on a work? And then blocks. We'll be excited to help. We're going to play full-tended. Hollers. He will draw the foul on Looney. And Mick is just happy nobody landed on him. Bigs. Wing three. There's a Mr. Three yet. Hollers on Wiggins. Step around. That's a good cut by marketing. Jeff's trying to hide behind Looney. Shot block down to five. Ranny with a hand. Looney the D.H. Jones for Wiggins three. Perfectly done. He still has a Mr. Three. Fargson off front. I heard him Wiggins with a rebound. Done. Good steal and then the lob of Collins. Good steal and then the lob of Collins. Jeff's key added not to it. That's what Dun does. This is H to the center. And Sektan hits the three. You know what I'm doing? Two turnovers and five quick points. Play on the rookie. And he scores right over Hendrix. At five points, Mike Clay Thompson and Warrior Winnie got to go back 12 years. Since they won a game where Yomny scored five. As Kessler ducks that home. David Horton Tucker. Grace Jackson Davis met him up top. And Yomna's with a step through. Grace runs the floor. And to end for the rookie. The trailer, Ken Yodas for three. Jackson Davis stepped it home. Five points, a block shot, a rebound. More second chance points for the Warriors. He's done. We're floater. Horton Tucker going all the way to the iron. Ken Yodas stole it. Push ahead, Clay. One second to finish. He laid it up and in. Having had to rely on just Steph tonight. Play Thompson's going to the line. Nine-and an opportunity for a three-point play. Leads a three-point play. Taylor and Horton Tucker hitting from deep. Those were 32-33 percent from Mary Stryke. Go, Clay. That was a running one foot in a vitsky. If I shot a shot like that coach, Don Yeltsin would have stood me back to the dealer. When Clay gets his own gray mod, knows he brought that same action. Marking in from deep. That's, that's, those are the ones that get you scared. Taylor and Horton Tucker. They spin the tornado and the Kessler to lay it in. He's creating. That has only 10 points in the game. Open three. Sets his feet. There it is. It's a split action. The screener's defender was just late getting out. Steph had all kinds of time. Steph. Okay. Okay. Here we go. Grace Jackson Davis on the roll to lay it up and in. How good is Grace Jackson Davis being? Grace on the roll. And putting it up at hand. He will pick up the foul. He thought that rebound with one hand. He'll call it's off. Oh my god. Steph Curry. He hit that for the BYU campus. He's a maniac. Clarkson rimming that in. Jazz is running out of time, but they're going to keep coming. The lobbed of Wiggins. It's all Steph. Lobbed of arcadon. That's a good fine from sexton. Executing the final 340. Steph 3. Got another one. He's got, that's a good idea. That passed stoned away. Play pushing with GP2. Back to Clay. Night night. That's it. That's the backer. 20 point lead. Clay Thompson. With 26. This is the team chasing the boardings of the standings. We'll be denied. And they rebounded well enough. 19 second change points. He's San Jose hitting a 3. Get some more people on the board. Score and board. So Kenny Atkinson and Chris Weems. Bruce Fray. Thank you.
