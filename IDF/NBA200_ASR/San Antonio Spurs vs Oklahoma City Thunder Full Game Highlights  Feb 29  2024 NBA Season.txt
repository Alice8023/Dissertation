 The Sal Rebound on it. And the stop by Devon. Hey kids, follow your shots. That's exactly right. Everybody tells you. The guy shoots and knows he's going to miss it or not. He's the first guy who knows it's off. And then the Thunder quickly counters as George knocked down the three. And then Holmgren knocks down the triple. Holmgren blocked by Lermont. And then the Thunder. And then the Thunder quickly counters as George knocked down the three. And then Holmgren knocks down the triple. And then Holmgren knocked down the triple. Holmgren. And then Holmgren blocked by Lermont. He got a cap. Made off for Kelton Johnson. And he bounced back for the 20-point night. And then Al Feseh. He knocked down the three and his burrs tied to ten as G.A. in the paint. Oh. Victor got that one after Sohan went for the fake. The Sal kicks off to Jeremy. Sohan got the three. Good sign for Jeremy as he has gone for the 30 recently from three. Williams with the dog. That's just a jogging bat on defense. So hand again. Spurs on top. 15-14. Thank you, Joe Salisander. Popped away again by Victor. Long ball inside. There you go. Good to work on Yama. Williams, Jay Dub. Damn, he scored a lot of way. He's got it. Yes, he can. Joe's knocks down the trees. Spurs by four, 2016. Great, Joe's continuing. The move from the outside is home. Very nice move inside. That way he has a distinct size of damage there over Julian Champini. Homegrown. Got to fight Victor and a couple of others. And it's tied at 20-9. Backdoor pass. And one coming up broke KC as Isaiah Joggins to fight. Joe knocks down the three. Every nine-and-a-half last year this year he's an eight. So hand the flash. Great catch there. The Salisander's burrs would not end here in the first quarter. S-G-A's. Average in 31. It's a little baseline. He's going to wait. Take a few exact many chances. Killed it. The lob balance. And one. For the big bow. Backdoor cut. A debacle will allow. He's making for ball up top. He's going to do it. Yes sir. That's it. That's it. There he goes. Take care of the ball. He's the NBA steals leader for a reason. And Isaiah Joggins takes the advantage of the turn over. The three-pointer. Malacan blocked by Holden. Back out Osmond. Now you take a three-infinity win. Johnson. Out to trade Jones. And he hits another three. How about that pass over the top? There's a right on the money. Now against Holden. Put it up and in. Williams to hold. Burrs we cut to three. Make it six. That's for the three-pointer. And the back. That's for the other box. And Jack just says great job running right down the move before. Double team comes. He spots Jones. Easy to. And the Wiggins. Wiggins is way to the bucket. The scores are way up the average of six to game. There's Jay again. And Jay wins the sound extender. The Sal with the Vist. We'll be right there to put it back in. Johnson for three. Got it. Johnson was seven. Burrs by eight. That's in their largest lead. Trying to cut it down. And doing so. Isaiah Jones. Jaydub, average in 18. And not another one down. Jones kicks it back out. Johnson. That's the fly by the best G.A. And Splicers of three. Just took his time. And the other way Williams answers again. He's a phenomenal player. Wembee rolls around and pulls in on the baseline jumper. Shake Jones's Alexander holds off. So Han lays it up and in. Took it. I like the start. I mean, you're going too big to start off in Williams. And to put the high arch on it to get it over Victor. Wembee. Got the three ball. Three ball. So Han throws one up. Got it. Jim. All the kicks are back to SGA. Turned it by Jones. And he gets the N1. All great. Oh, he got tricky there. I'm going to underneath the Armour Vister. I'm going to underneath the Armour of Deepeths. And then that drains a three. Same Antonio now. 12 of 24 and 3 points. You. That was just rude there. No. Kills. You're dunking. Julian taking the brunt of that. Zaps. Good decision there to go with that right hand. It hooks back. Jones chases it down. What's his way to a memory? Shake and bake. I don't know why he brought that back out. He had a smaller guy on him. Flips it out. It's a brand of deepest trouble. Malachi. There is him out. Very effective and efficient offensively. Malachi brand of. SGA. Champenny hits the three. Well, we'll take advantage of it. I'm going to have to hold it alive. And she's saying somewhere on his couch. And then an am one for J. Will. Johnson gets his shot trying to stay with G.A. He's got to put too much pressure on one side. Same spurs. Brandon. He scores. I'm going to hit it. SGA. Thinking everybody out. He has 27. The sell top shot. Off the iron and thunder. Push it with seven seconds. Williams again. And one. The brand nearly lost it. They tried to throw it off of Williams. And the turnover leads to a dunk. And we are tied at 90. And Williams gives him the lead. And he's got a good trade. Oh, Mama goes with the left hand. Dord. That's off it to foul there. No whistle and he gets the buttons. Jeremy. Jeremy. Holmgren. Underneath and Wiggins gets loose for the button. So hand for three. Yes, sir. Jeremy's so hand. It comes to hell. Seven on the shot clock in Williams. Does he ever miss? No. Five on the shot clock. The sell launches it. Holy muck goodness. Give him the sell. Huge three in the spurs lead by the end. Dord. It's the step back jumper this time. Spurs lead cut to one. And then the so hand for three. There you go. Quick stop there. That's the one. Yes, you. That's the one. Jeremy, get the bucket. Put it off the glass. And so hand for 20 point game or better. Holmgren counters with a vicious duck. 116, 113. Jones launches. Oh, Mama. We know. Victor ribs down the radar. He fires. He scores. Double team. Two seconds. Williams. He hits a three. Seven stops and fires. Got it. And SGA. Never going to be less done of it. Here's the sell. Back to Victor. Another three. Get out of here. Oh, my goodness. Holmgren. The answer. He is stuck. Have taken away. The sell. Wiping, scooping, scoring. Here's the first. How about that? I mean, classic flop. Jones. A hand. This way. That's a top on this one. Oh, that's an M1. There we go. That was good.
