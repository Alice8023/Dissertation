 in the middle of the corner. The corner. Junior jumping center against Jaylin Durin and here we go on a Sunday night. Another full house inside Kia Center to watch the magic play basketball. Very well against the pistons this year. Sucks. Carter. Got it. Carter. We're calling the window of Carter. Shooters. Well over 40%. Nice. Nice fly by Kaye Cuttingham. To Jay to 90. Hey, people. I've been. Swatted away by Carter. Three points shot by Thomas and the way off. Stewart saves it to Durin back the steward to just step back in bounds and hammers it in. Durin. And Carol into the middle. Beans in. Gary Harris is open from the back. He got it. More than one or two. Yeah. Shooting 19%. Harris. Sucks on the cut and the hammer. Durin. Hours into the back. Wild shot though. Repented by Sucks. Long pass ahead. Tobager. He scoops it in on the glass. There's hands in. He's a liver. Here's a chum. Rhyme. The Sucks with a shot. He's a liver. Here's a chum. Rhyme. The Sucks with a shot. Clock under 10. Sucks. Carter. Nice fake on Stewart. Over rattles in. One on one against cutting hand. Spaddle of number one. Six. This time cutting hand with that duel. In again. Into the body of Carter. Sucks flying through the air. The Clock to shot. He's coming to you too. I'm going to give you that. Left side. To the lane. Wide open. Three. Prepare. Rhyme. Reverses it in. Three. Rhyme. Rhyme. Rhyme. Reverses it in and. Ketsulee. To one. And Orlando only 3-1. He's just a chance to take the lead. Stewart. 4-1. Nice delivery to Stewart. And three takes the lead. And 27. And a rebound. Orlando. Don't fulks. Jonathan is it. On the floor. Fulks. Fatal A. Betalai jumper. It's good. Oops. Backing in. Takes it to the other side and shoots it off the left. It's tough. Sturts around Stewart. Eyes in quick toss to bolts. 18 foot jumper. It's good. And the buzzer. On a winable games. So you're not watching the standings in the scoreboard. You're just going to win the games. You should win, right? But the players should be doing it. Well, the gutter, the offensive rebound, put that on the years. And that's well-short of Detroit. What's that 41 years difference? So what is it you're trying to? Are you saying that? You're going to be that long. So you had to still, whenever you were in. You know, like you're just saying the magic. Raising hope. How about that? What I'm going to do. I'm going to play. I'm going to play. I'm going to play. I'm going to play. I'm going to play. Right, techie, oh, the 4-0. 3 points shot by Evan. Is good. We saw that. Hey there. I appreciate it. I was trying to get a little perspective. Like, you know, it's exactly what you were trying to do there. You're just pointing out. Just pointing it out. Yeah. Just the information. And Darrow is back on the floor. It just needs a little more, David. It's one of, no where you're headed with. Sometimes there's just not anything else. Well, that's why you get a buzzer. I have way through the second quarter. It's a two-point Orlando Magic League. Arder. Raised it down. No, the band carol. He keeps it up high and draws the foul. Smart. Rebounded by band carol. You're fine to block. Second quarter. Woo! It's an only two for ten. Yeah. There are spots of honor. And the foul on Thompson. Just a perfect, telling hand back. So that was down there. Behind the back to Durant. And for the flybite. Jalen Durant. Roger kept his dribble alive. Made a brilliant face. And this is the shot. Detroit's got it. Taken away. Arder. Four three. Got it. Rodder. Arras swips it through there to sub-sounds the carter. To band carol. Shot lock and three. And carol will drive. Hey! Off the glass. Just end the end of the clock. Big straight. And able to see over the defense. Rodder driving on Stewart. The fouls. Two for Mark Cal. I'm in carol. I'm picking roll with the carter. Spitting two for that. The jumper is. Go. Got it back. Climb it in down and through. Very arous. Swings it to sub-s. Extouring into the lane. Stepping through and putting it in. Jalen's sub-s with a really nice move. Jumping through. The fouls press. Takes it all the way. The fogger guard is behind Thompson. Cal over at carol. Takes it. One dribble. And the four. Fighters it in. Early as a third. Worst. He'll drive. It can be a little bit more than. Fighters open. Herald is for three. Yes, though. 21's going to lead to their random magic. They're biggest. Van Carro. Fly to their hand. His band cutting hand. Shield off inside. Stewart's next up against Van Carro. Three point shot. A beauty. Deflected and stolen by his voice. Thompson. He's broken up by Sucks again. Engels. Four point pass to Van Carro for the dog. 27 points for the magic. All-star's pala. He took it away now. Quick hands at Thompson. He's jammed by his foot. Sparrowing down. The other end leaves it in. Or the magic man. Giving daylight to shoot for three. And that rattle's in and out. Anthony Reef has put stolen away by Thompson. He goes behind his back. He's got away from him. Bontecchio with the three. And the take. The only 31. I can pick that for little. Sparrowing down. Look at that reverse by both. Engels. Picking roll with one. We're off the glass. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's a little mojo right there. Very clever. Hey. See if they give in. Oh, the system. I think they gave them a shot at that. 48. Leaves it in. Well, David, you guys are exactly right. He told him, keep it simple. You know, coach Mosley, that's always been the message. Do what got you to lead. Get back in transition. You got to depend. Nine turnovers, that quarter. Ordie with a high to high as here. The second hand against his former team. Please make a little game with Weisman and the foul on the magic. Nothing there. Watch it. Felt. Refresh. Got it. Yeah. Want to take you over Rebeth. Gives it the wise man with a real house dunk and the magic will take a time out. During the time on one set of the two. Okay. Five. Five. Oh, another assist. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five. Rescue by Carter with the dunk. Here comes the double team from five Tekkyl now. He moves away. Foggers spinning through his right wall. Squared. Squared. And the foul on Weisman. Four and five years from the physical. Sucks for three. Fathor to four. He wants to shoot. He'll drive and floated up an end. Seventeen for Evan Fournier. Very low in steals. Sucks to a wide open broadfinger. You're stepping through the lane. Lage it in. A 30 or 29 point game now for Banffaro. Can't extend your arms and push. Tops it. Today you can't. The flexion and the steal. Sucks ahead of the pack. Ducks it in. Good plays. Shocked ball. Pretty well this season. Been available for. Why? Four three. The long season continues for the pistons. They had that 28 game losing. Scared from October to late December. They've been better of late but still. That there is few in far between. And the magic went at tonight. One 13 to nine.
