Staying in front, Brux and Leeds in to Q with the dumps. One of his seven rebuts. Good play, well done. He's paying tarot. Muscling it in for Q-born 20 in a hand for Palo. First hand. Good and five left. Almost to steer. It is to steer. Nice and to Palo. Karol. He matches Brux in 22. I don't know if he was right there. Wow. Super Allen Brux. And Karol. Again. Not this time. And no, he's a giant back. He puts it in on the glass. You know I love this magic defense. But I love me some offensive basketball. How about that second quarter? 38 points. Magic. Fint to 18. And the quarter. That's not too bad. You made a early three in the first quarter. That's one down to start the second hand. One good. Answers. Good for three. And Anthony Blackfield behind. Taken by Houston. Palo. Cherry Pickett for two. That's not a little. That's not a hard cross towards the Brux. Hard back to Brux and three over. And he was dialed in. Is it? Or double double? I'll be here. That's a good one. That was Van Perra. That's good for three. Hard end of the body of vodka. Very tough shot. From defended a beautiful. Van Perra. It's a black streak game for two. How about that pass? Orlando. Good bite. 10 at the hand. And five at the hand. And the pitch out the angles. Wide open lay. Kicks it. Black Debancero. Excellent extra pass. Sturder for baby. Chula. And the back of the bride. Anthony to check me and Gargis in. He'll want to get it right by sent to Chula. And he'll just a monster on the boards. Anthony. And for I walked in on it. Anthony. He's just dribbling on a big hop step. Short jumper is good. Four to Josh Hart. Wrong spot, though. Okay, Chero. Two angles. Four three. A two. Three points. Nothing but net. Prussia Satua has tied his season high with 18. Six on to give the Brunson. Take it away by Mova. Anthony shoots it ahead to Brian. The lock for Asant. The two handed dump. The timeout by New York. Defined a guy like Jonathan Isis or Jaylin Slugs. Great off the ball with the pitchers. There's a great play by Brunson. Feeding happened for his first points of the game. Three years of Kentucky. The ball, Joe. A fuck there with the dump. Brunson picked up by six. Brunson's an overspin through his right. Brunson's a massive for the two handed dump. In the injury, did I say even Chimson? Just two stir-up games. Three points, Jack. Pruban Carro. His six of the night. Okay, Carro, David. Just right into a Chua. Even him. Planting on the ground. I have it. So his way in close. And the foul. Bull. Music. Chua to birth. He's a good job by Cole. Of course he gets a good job by Cole. Of course he gets a good play to win. He's a good job by Cole. Of course he gets a good play to win. Of course. Chua. Brian and Garth and Carro. Feeding set for the duck and the foul. 21 point lead and the ball. And Carro, looking for Moore. Hello, Adlin Sims. Oh, the only top of a box in three. And a power. 36 for Bantill. And Russ, this ain't fair. His dot-dowling as well. As the lob comes to tap and he's got an upstance like his brother. Stop and answer off of the right side with Charlie Brown. Top three. Four three. Was Bantill a victory for the first half of the season. This is a shot rebound to Chua. He's got another one who's 13th and tonight. And he'll take it close to post and lay it in. That's a new season. A high for him. A great season today. Love this. You have to get home. So you had a game tonight. Yeah. Keep on, Harris. Okay, home to City last night, New York tonight. If someone had said you can get one of the two, just look around. Thanks for watching.
