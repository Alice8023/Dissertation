J.K. could have shot that or you saw, I'm talking about the balance score. Just because you're open for the three point line, doesn't mean you have to take it every speech, good rebound after boxing out. Wiggins attacking. That's the way to go right out the tall timber. You see that transition. College instant replay where they bounce you through. Walker step behind the back to Dremont. He will launch that three and the hustle Walker Kessler. Yachtay George is going to be rising star. And a few guys who can knock him down and give him time. Kamega in on the shop blocker and he'll get to the line. Oh, and then they can take tough shots like that last week. So sex didn't missing that three. Loose on the deck. How long it's good hustle and Kessler is fast. So Kamega. So the skip past the wing. It's left to left wing three. Perfect. Figure out how to work together. It's been a big part of the war is success lately. Yachtay George from deep. So here's sexton driving again and set up Collins. Wiggins step back wing three with some makes. Sexton back to Collins and pick it up. John Collins inside early play top. Jason Drawn kick lead the Warriors. Yachtay George for turnovers for seven jazz points. That's not going to help you keep doing that. Can you hold as it open on the Warriors run his own here? Try to take them out of rhythm. Taylor. Step down the lane. Want to get out of the game. They just first five shots. Play Thompson contested three ball. Play T's got it. Play runs it back. He took the bump. He made it. They only take eight to well they normally don't take that many. They get to the paint. There's 23rd of the league. Yeah. And they try to go inside. Mark and able to draw the foul. Dario for three. Good. Kessler out of the lane. And Pajewski should you drag it this morning? A little bit. We just talked for a living. I didn't really sleep all last night. It was tough.

Dremons early foul trouble, but. Dremon left alone. Yes. Extra knee bat. And it looked the exact same. We'll be able to tell a difference in the naked highest telecast. You want to play well individually going in to the all star break. Absolutely. Steph Curry with a recover there. Wiggins lost the handle. Where is the taking pretty good care of the ball to hold first half? Get up. Yachtay George is having a night. Play Thompson on the kickout. Steph on the reload. K back to Clay. I'll keep him rolling. Sexton and Pajewski to stay with him. And Clay right to the win. And they've got cutting. I mean, Kamena's defender isn't in between him and the basket. Just go back door. And then 15,000 points. Sixth warrior to do that. Keep bottom heading into halftime. And Todd built an 11 point lead. Warriors responded with the on ball defense. He's not using screens right now. He's just being people off the dribble this quickness. Steph Curry gets the point. The champs keep final minute of the first half. Dremont's been hot from that spot. Clay running with Dremont. And he sets him up. The Warriors have sprung it on here. Yachtay George is having a night. Five seconds. George's trying to stay with Steph. But Jepski three to and the half. And then make it down the lane. Dremont. Reddit and laid it in. Now that's. Let him be the benefit here every now and then. Yachtay George denied. And it's an offense with Wiggins either shooting that or driving that. And they're not that. How it sexed in. Frapping in and three. The only thing that's gone wrong is the points of turnovers. Steph skidded away. Laudde Camenga. You make it. Camenga doing pull ups on the rim. How many kids were getting up 71 points and a half? No. And Kessler. These. The Warriors contribute to some of it with turnovers. Dremont is for that's what Camenga has to do. He and Wiggins have to get on the glass. Look at the throw. Dremont. Wiggins post up. Jack Lockett. No double coming. We got to that. Oh, I so call it. Sexton. And that's the. For 13. And the sexton with. He's. Sexton. Now. Sexton coming up with a steal. Yachtay George three.

Clarkson dropping a bat six to grab Kessler kept it alive. Mark and it takes it back in and tips it. Oh. There's a need turn and he left in this game. The only problem is the points off of turnovers. Mark it in three. See if you get Steph something. And what about G.P.2. Sexton driving. Yachtay George missing. Look at first step. We know. Okay. And there's a third. Clay feet set.

College. Five seconds left. College throws it away. As soon as the end bounder throws the ball, you can foul your man before the ball gets to him. He doesn't have to catch it and then you fouls. The keys you have to be close enough to make sure you foul. So it's not in the upward shooting motion and you get to where it's too close to call. Clarkson. And... Sexton. A three. And the lower is one. College. Sexton. Misses a three. Misses a three.
