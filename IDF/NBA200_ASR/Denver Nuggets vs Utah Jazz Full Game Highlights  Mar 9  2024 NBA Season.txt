 You ready? You game? I'm game. Jumping against Nicola Yokech and Yokech has a tap. He's really perfect at the tap now. He's getting every time. It's timing. The third in the West has came back. Minnesota won game back out of the plunder who were in first place. Yokech's first shot is on the world and good. Michael Porter Jr. snapped at the Gordon back to Porter. He's going to fire a three. And he news it. Michael Porter Jr. is playing so confidently. He had that bank shot and then he did a little something to the Nuggets bench over here. Maybe he's talking for a rookie. And that K-Demolian full report. Now Murray shoots a three. That's good. Now the Nuggets playing with nice confidence. Late first round. Jazz had three first rounders. Yokech is in the lane. He tops it in for another bucket. When Deterna gets kicked in the K-Yokech is the ball back. And K-Demolian is called well-pulled. On the run. He'll pull up. And head for a three. And the Nuggets hot shooting five for five. The other day George Handling up top. These are routine from Baylor in a smooth one. He lays it in. Jazz had three first round pin. The ball through that is a turning point where they were playing well. But Yokech is over the top. Down he goes. And his five on four. Six in into the lane. Strips. And right to Kessler who puts it away. And corner with the intersection. Good anticipation. And head to Gordon. Look out below. Instead corner three. Murray. Yes. Yokech with four points. Kessler's a tall guy. He's got shop walking. You can't stop that. Nobody can. Cullen's had some hops. And Yokech has it again. He's perfected that art too, folks. Gordon is on the run. Gordon in the lane. Lay it up in it. Pound it. Tucker is also in. He wears number five. Now Clarkson. Clarkson down the next. The column. And the three. Rim Rocks. And Michael Moll. The holiday on Kessler. Jazz have not made a three. There's zero for six. And Yokech helps it in. Really impressive pass there. For these we'll work this for. He's got the green light to let it fly at any time for the jazz. There's a three point shooting story. For some eights by the jazz. We're in with the ending jumper and it's four little zero. On both ends. Two seven and ten. The big point line. I mean Denver average is 11 made three. The game there is seven. Ever to the first quarter. They also have five small shots. Pretty good quarter on both ends of the board for Denver. It's only committed two turtle doors. If they're not cost them a point. Now Murray caps off. And that's good too. Now Jamal Murray is shooting 41. I just will reset two minutes into the second quarter. Murray long range. That's good. Two. Time out. Hey Utah. That's what I mean. You're. She called Marlow for pictures. And he had a. It's not. A nice lob. The Christian Brown. It's something. Katie Bench is a little bit earlier. The bag of some ball. He made ten three. It's not. After it. And Murray comes up with it and puts it in. Sixteen games missed. Now Murray's got it. Gonna push one against Dund. There it goes. Whoa. Whoa. That's. No. No. No. No. He could not score. Now Zhu Zang's snap it. Now long range three. And that's good by Horton Tucker. Now can't they George with it. Got it. Told you that the. The jazz shoot 30. It's really good. Now Yochitch against Yurtso. Falls back. And hits. Not a song more shuffle but nicely done. Our Jets are already six points tonight. The reporter. He pulls. And nails it. And that is a new season. Now the poor. And now the poor. And now the poor. And now the poor. And now the poor. And now the poor. And now the poor. And now the poor. And now the poor. And now the poor. And now the poor. And now the poor. And now the poor. That was a confident york as quote. Nice Yeah What off the first back half time report coming up. Vick Hansen-Depsey. Yokechin side and the slight taking candy from a baby. Five seconds here in the second quarter. Now corner three is on the way and good. Colin Sexton. The first quarter and then 40 to 22 in the second quarter. As we have bought here in quarter number three, Senseba is in the lane and jumping high. He was picked up to 32. Senseba. Senseba in the lane. I like this kid. I think it's difficult to keep that competitive mindset at the level it needs to be. But what you need to do is just not look at the score. Well, the Denver Nuggets. Long pass. We put it right out there. And he caught the chance. They were playing a role. I think he's six to six to go with 18 points and six rebounds. Now, Sexton, that's going to be another foul. It's the strongest guy on this team. I remember when he tried that same play and the ball went puff in the air and got intercepted. That is a lot tougher of a throw. Senseba. Lay it in. And A.G. trying to take advantage of the mismatch. Oh. That's a lot of a throw. Don't sit in there. The thing is he seals blocking shots. Jamal Murray right there. Just knew that pass he's coming there and was right there. Now, the update, Georgia in the lane. Challenged by a quarter and the foul. And a possible hit. Murray's got it. Shakes off a man. And now Yoko has an 18-footer. Gives it up to Kessler and he's snow rolls it with the down shift. And it's intercepted by KCP. One of the elite defenders, we talked to you about. And he bangs it home. I get here in the first quarter. If you shoot 67 percent, you call just 44 percent. Senseba drops it home. Why don't you say that, Kelly? That's why I asked everyone to talk. The key is now. Oh, there's a horrible call right here. So you want to stay true to your game plan and what the way you want to play. Senseba has got the steal. He's in a Christian corner. That's good counts foul. Tip was no. And the jazz have a little life here. Yeah, I think Georgia rocks it from three and now. Seven assists, six rebounds. George, heat check. That's good too. Okay, okay, Georgia's lighting it up. We're just shooting it. We're just gonna shoot it back. The exit has the steal. Look out below. Behind the back. Oh no. Cold one pulled for three. Oh yes. Long pass. Yoage is out there. And he puts it away. Nicole, you're all good. Jump high. Heading this group by done now. Where he's in the lane. Court screw. Top shot. Got it. Rapples at home. And then all over. Very good. Two seconds. What's it up? And he ends. Against the top defender in the hands. Brown recognized Ignatid. No one. This is an opportunity for me to get a free. I just kind of get their defense back with it. Just can't get a stop here. There are exchangey buckets. Jammin' it. What? Ziknaji. Christian Brown. You're all strong. High bout Utah. Pretty play. And the lead believes it's 22. I like this energy. Look, we've been able to find CD along the three point line. Parks and drops. What is? Watson by his man. Swing it. After Murray. Four three. Yes sir. Let me see. One, two, three. Watson's in the lane. Little floater. That's good. Boy, you see his game. Carson. Yeah, Watson's way it is. And another foot. 13. Look at the pass. Holiday down with that little deokit. Some of the defense and drops it hard. Four or a kill. Two or three. Watson. Yeah, Watson's way it is. And another foot. 13. Look at the pass. Holiday down with that little deokit. Four or a kill. Like. Carson is such a good driver. Ah! The lane Murray. Yes. So it's the ball Murray. 40. How many games was it? 63 games.
