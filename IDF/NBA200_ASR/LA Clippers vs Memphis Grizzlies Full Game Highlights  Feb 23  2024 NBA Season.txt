 You ready? You game? I'm game. Zuban's in Jackson, jump it up. And the Grizzlies will have it first to start this ball game. Through now sporting sponsorship logos. And our not a throwback. Jared weaves his way inside. Yes, and the foul on Zuban's foul actually on the wide letter. Jared top 10 collegiate, verdict and one Zuban's. That's his signature shot. He shoots 67 percent was getting in Philadelphia, but he has been very productive, particularly with a three point shot near this month. Jared's man, 31 percent. We know the show they can be consistent for mid. Jared short with a three in the rebound to heart. Hard shooting 40 percent, 47 percent resistance here in the month in Terrence Man. Did not play against Milwaukee, resting eight. Right on in jury. Second item back to back Zuban. Zuban's rolls against a double key. But Terrence Man who lays it up in an. The wide letter is not taking the shot to the offensive. The bench trying to drop off, but it's intercepted. Fall George 211, a look ahead to quiet letter for the dunk. We can lead a three point percentage. So that is a big loss to the clippers off the bench. Zaiir for three. Zaiir Williams as I see it. We were talking earlier tonight on Grizzly's live, a brevon about coming back from the All-Star Graeme and trying to shake off the rust early. Looks like the Grizzly's have done that. Taylor Jake, it's Tony Tean for the last time out. And Zuban's got away with one and Westbrook scores on the other end. I don't know if I can't see the hurl the barrel. Correolo's scoring average. Fall George off balance. Tipped up and in by quiet letter. Quiet, Huff Bay, Paul George lines up the three and hits and the clippers go up seven. Something important, Shreegin for this team. Under four remaining close quarters. Quiet on a back down. Shacklott down to five. Jam with a reflection. Luce ball picked up by Derek Rose. Rose, a look ahead to Vince. What a delivery by Derek Rose. I'm out of the burn. Stevens the rebound. Riding a streak of three consecutive double figure gains. Time's up for three. To the clippers. Because, although they may come up with a near-carter, Westbrook gets inside as they can finish the income off the camera PJ Tucker. That's the team that you're supposed to be. And that's where they've done a good job of. Lamar, Stevens, yes. Died to the floor dish. Or wherever's the Wilson names in the game. And sometimes. Lamar, Stevens, it's again. Lamar, Stevens. Lop, missed on the tip. Moravia in transition. Yes. And the bruises have the lead back. Moravia, Shacklott down to three. Lost out. Man. Lays it in and the foul. And way point of quarter number two. Vince, against man, takes him into paint, floats it up. Got it to go. Now your william back down to floor. To hand on Ty here, knock away. Vince, look ahead. GG. Goes around. Come on, go to the goal and finish it. Jaren's able to get himself all into the basketball for someone who's there. He's got a winner. This game's a double team. Oh, the passiver is sceptified that year. Going to the right. Grizzlies with the lead. Rebound, Jaren. Traveled it loose from Siubon's picked up by GG Jackson. Three and a half remaining in the first half. Jaren's thought about a one-to-three. GG will take. He'll make. From down. He comes into the game for his grizzly team. And his skill set. Rebound, GG 13. All George just three points on one-of-five shooting. But he can get hot in a hurry. And all kinds of contact, Chrissy's. Not happy with the lack of a whistle. What they're sitting there. Siubon's. Fallen's up in the hands of Kawaii Leonard. He's wide open, passed on the shot. For an open man. And Terrence Mann is having his best game. Very good for most positions. Offensively. And after 118, he'll gain Jaren. Yes! It's a bucket on the scorecard. That's all that matters. Kawaii. Zubon's set on the dunk. Got the step against Jaren. He sets up a wide open, Kawaii for three. Long rebound. Back to Kawaii. He'll reload in here. The second chance opportunity for Kawaii Leonard. 13. And Leonard. With the steal from behind. Zahir comes up with a loose ball and finds all done over the flush. And Avergick 8-a-game. It's a prior game against Grizzy. How do I do that tonight? Can I? Yes! And Kawaii Leonard steals the inbound pass. I'm going to hit on Chow. Westport driving. Finisher. Three on two. On Chow, the knockaway. And then Gigi a bad pass. Stone back by coffee. Coffee never quit on the play. Coffee is for closers. And Kawaii Leonard ties the game with a jam. They have such versatility up and down there. Rock. Pardon. That's the flick of my punch out. Grizzy's a break opportunity. Chow loves Grizzy and Williams. Holy cow. Making a man tonight. Vince crossing over. Block Kawaii. And the clippers have the lead back. Fresh 14 for the clippers. Six off-latch rebound. Just third ball. Leonard gets. Kawaii Leonard on the knockaway. Double punch three. Leonard hits. Outscore in the Grizzy's by ten as he has before. Their throws drives off-latch it in for their... Grizzy's going to have to get clean defense rebound. Let they get the breakoff opportunities again. Steven's backing down and hitting. Mark Stevens. Westbrook for three. Zubat's offensive rebound. Paul George for three. They have the lead back. Stevens against man. 360 spin. Going glass. Steven's with it. Zubat's going to the goal. The finish. Clippers have lost two of their last three. Their defense has not been good. Zubat spins into a double-team. Vince knocked it away. An open man three is in. And Terrence Man, a new season high for him. He's pulled the clippers level at 87. Jaren little in and out. Attached Zubat's leads in and scores again. Paul squared 89. Zubat's a double-double. And he's going to be free on the baseline. The current game are trying to get the Swiss. No more fouls to give. Vince's timing on the sideline. Jaren backs down against Kuala and breaks it in. Chrisley's lead at 93 in the future. Jaren's right to go again. Jaren's in. Kuala's a double. It's hard this time. And man double-double on a bad pass. Stolen by Kuala for the dump. And now the clippers lead. Crucial, crucial turnover. Step back. Bobby shot clock down to 6. Gigi Jackson goes hard. Who rises from three and hits his first field goal of the game. 15 games with ball from three points. Makes that ends tonight. Rises two game winning streak ends.
