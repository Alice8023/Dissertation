 You ready? You game? I'm game. Rising superstars in the game, after the Edwards, it is the typical of the opening tip and a way we go from the crypto. That by James Harden at the controls, it's a cyst of way up in Siobhan's and great combo in Siobhan's gets the scoring started tonight. Siobhan's kicks it ahead but right into the hands of Conley. The first turn it over. Edwards drives it, Minnesota, the first points it is after the Edwards who delivered at age 22. His star is rising quickly. Anderson guarding Paul George. George burries a step back three pointer. Anderson sticks with George here. Now the switch is George gets Anderson on his back. Leonard and George both missing the game against a buck someday and there's the beer. Laces of three pointer. Normally Harden will be the facilitator but that doesn't always have to be the case. Anderson gets inside. He is fouled at a chance at a three point play. Go bear ends up on Harden. They cleared out for him. A mismatch. Harden pulls it. Harden hits a second three. It's still in some confidence and it will see Highland. We'll see Nas Reed coming off that minutes. He's here, going on the floor for the first time. And the shooter's bounce from Kawai Leonard gets out of the go. Did you reach Finn? Did you reach tape and ankle that faster? Did he just heal? Oh, what a bootball. George, right by him. Paul George spins off Nas Reed. Now to USC. Getting to spend some extra time here in Hall. He's from the England Empire. From Rancho Cucamanga. Alexander Walker hits a three. A lifeer in this game from coaching overseas. A long time assistant coach. Again, Alexander Walker. Able to lay it in. Lippers trying to put a 30 spot on the best defense in the NBA in his first quarter. Paul is highland. Step back three is good. Oh, smooth. The sightings are activated. You've been moving forward. Edwards. A flurry of moves takes on Tyson. Delivers with the left hand. Back to a ten point game. The sights set off the top spot in the West with a month to play. Highland drives it home. It's going to pass. It's a foul and it goes. More than they thought. He's his credit. He worked at it. He's been a great three point shooter. Now on cue in traffic scores a lap on Belbehr. There's one of those two players who will do strong considerations. With six minutes of the year. Here's Mike Connelly trying to approve that three point shooting number. Does right away as he returns to the floor. Connelly guarded by coffee. Mike Connelly feeling it. Second three is good. Alexander Walker. Tommy of top tie disrupted. Allen. Off you run on the floor. Side steps. Squars and one. With this schedule coming up in the zone and the injury to cap. Well, a foul shot big steps in. Little bit round. Tougher, how silky smooth was that? George now. Guarded by Connelly. Oh, George will go to work as they cleared out on them. El Combs, George keeps the trouble. Coffee the extra pass, they're starting to dominate the corner. Before I think that keeping them somewhat approach into the office, we're on another office at the hotel where Copaer hammers at home. Wolves are very good inside their division and very good inside their conference this year. The 30-11 against the West is Edwards, lays it in. Wow. And he's fouled, he'll have a chance of three. That's definitely ready. We're forwarded that. There's hope that he will return. A little fake behind the back, hard-nabble, lay it in. And there's a rebound, calmly running up ahead. Edwards is going to take it himself and lays it in. Come to a real shot at the championship. What's it been? 53 years? What a move there by hand in the Edwards, little crossover. 53. And the Minnesota run continues here. A 14-2 run. It's looking to add to it. Warren kicks it in the corner. Look at that. Alixander Walker hits a three. He'll allow Alexander Walker. Walker looking for Edwards who steps into a three. And it goes. A Reggie Miller bounce. And it's a four-point game. Now it goes to work. Hard little hesitation. Fire's into coffee. Coffee steps in. Coffee scores over no bear. CBS. TNT and TV. It all streams on Max. The selection someday. Just someday. It's Ruby Gobert with the follow. Working on him in the back. There's a lingering issue. And they were in breath. It was called George who hits a three-pointer. Edwards took the earning minutes these days. Edwards turned it over, man, with the steel man. Lays it in. George trying to climb two bots. Turns it over. Nice play by the Daniels. Edwards kicks it to Conley. Three-pointer in the corner is good. Mike Conley delivers his third-made three. For Los Angeles here. Skip pass. Alixander Walker. Man, he's got it going. 22. Chance to take the lead here. Edwards. The follow by Gobert and Minnesota. Excited to play their identity as a defensive mind game this off season. There's a corner hit. Alixander Walker continues his terrific night. Edwards. Trying to get by man, man. With a move. Edwards. Shifty move right there. Ties it for the clippers after that. The number three to acquire heart. Edwards shakes man. And for the Edwards starting to cook right now. Edwards closes. Highly blue, denied by Reed. Here comes McLaughlin. Anderson on the break. Steer row. And he knocks it down. And a son of back in front. George now. I'm going to buy Edwards. Look at this. I like it. Edwards. Oh, good speed. George Captain Murray. Of course, as it turn over, Edwards drives and lays it in. Their biggest lead has been two. That's it. Edwards. What's him up for? Anthony Edwards, a Georgeable dog. And offered to go to the bench. But man goes into the starting line up and it seemed to click at that point. It's go bare drives on two backs and a tough layup for Rudy Gobert. Extra pass into the corner. Most traveled there. But this is going to be a short run for the first time. He's back. Now there's a highland set off by Codley now. Highland kicks it. Coffee's in the corner and he buries a three. Coffee missed it. McLaughlin, three out. Two point cards on the floor. Now Codley. On the receiving end from McLaughlin. McLaughlin secures it. Reed and ZuVont's. Scurry back into the play. Anderson to read. Reed without ZuVont's lays it in. Also shot out to Marc Dango. and the goal. Oklahoma City Thunder as Mike Conley is on fire from three point grades. And this wave just keeps coming for the walls. Highland tribes and lays it in. And it looked like they were staring three in a row. Pretty clearly in that first half. But it's been a different story is Anthony Edwards. The Edwards he'll let a three fly Edwards. Watch. And Minnesota. You're the easy. He's got 35. For the game only five free throws as well. George backs his way in. Turn around jumper is good. I think Ty Lou is ready to raise the white flag here. In the corner. A finisher by the kill Alex. All right. Thank you step. She's been busy tonight. Why don't we got her 10,000 steps in. Brandon Boston lays it in for the Clippers. Xavier Moon on the floor. Mason. No Edwards. The follow. About a clean 37 here for him for the Edwards. And the game. All star coach this year. And one great story. He is. For where he's come from.
