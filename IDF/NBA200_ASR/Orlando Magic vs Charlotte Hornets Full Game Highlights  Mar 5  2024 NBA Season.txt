 You ready? You game? I'm game. My bad was the time. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. So with that addition of Nick Richards, Hornets will have two days off for the first time in a while tomorrow. And there's basically, feels the guys can stretch those minutes a little bit more. That's a Cody out. He's got a score ball shooted with a belt. Man got it a flutcheon, but right over to Sucks. Jalen Sucks of an end. A one six of their last seven. There are 35 win team right now if you're only winning 34 a year ago. Four, quakeys for Mitchage. The banker finds Harris in the corner playing angry. And Harris hits the three and points to the bench. All from three is now 16 for his last 25 from behind the arc. 64% is hot. My break is off balance with the right hand. Mitchage, wide pass Wagner, and throw away. I think he had a laugh. Yeah, he didn't realize it. I'm careful. I'm so good. Here's Shreyman all in the baseline. Shot clocked out of three. Brandon's going to have the fire. Catch a good shot. Oh, that's a good back. A little doubt about it. That's the guy that has a feel for the game. Welcome in to Charlotte. That's just going to have to have him come to the moment. Nick Richards gets himself a hammer. Wow, step right in front of the magic defender. The high percentage shot. Mitchage. Oh, it's going to fall. So strength by the serve. That's respectable for a center. Yep. Step back, man. Yes. Three balls, Shreyman. That's his move right there. Man, fighting, gliding into these screens. Up and under for trade. Also into the game, the other Wagner. Moe Wagner. Oh, OK. The English started remaining in the game. Orlando, and he gets a bucket. Oh, no. Black. Oh, my goodness. How soft is that shot? What he is thinking about in terms of the vision for this team comes highly regarded. Oh, the rare. Two point field goal. Now he's for time. Everyone's not named mild, Bridges. Shooting basketball on the first quarter, Delph. Seven for now. Oh. Rapper on dunk. Moe Wagner. Get the assist, Anthony Black. One is down by. For time. Quick trigger. Yeah. Got him set. But Duncan now he's feeling the vapor. Six hits. You're right over the top. One is down to another steal for Orlando. It's Isaac. He's called the minister of defense for a reason. He's got a major pass for time. From the lumber town. Now he says I'll take it from there. Second three pointer for the Latvian laser. Tough chance. Oh, I'll open up. Terrible. Latvian laser. Miles runs it down. Trayman. What an idiot. Three. Division one conference. He played an eyeball. Arkansas and Florida State. We played the big tennis, the SEC, and the ACC. But no one can put an understanding sign. 38 points. Re-botted by Franz Wagner. Carter. Second three pointer. He's got three ball working for that. Seeing spot. And last handful again. Probably step outside of the ring. At short, 13 minutes. He's got his way. Open look. He's dead. Miller. Nick was the only starter for the Hornets. He didn't turn it over in first lap. What's that step away? Left hand is layup up and in. Follow by the kettle. Get out of this way, relocate. The float game is good. Gary Harris. Doing Gary Harris things that's in your man at triple. I really want to three. Okay, look at that. What does that have to do with that? Well, point five of six shooting. Miller. Pointed lead. Take this cover on. Bride just causing a little problem here. Let's go. Okay. Franz Wagner is arrived. Late getting into your arena, but he gets his first two. Welcome to the game. Wagner with authority. You're going to hold it down forever. Man, you got to be careful. Passes against this team. There you go. Miles Bride is up in hand. Miller has to pick up his dribble, speak counted, and the ball picked up by Sucks. Jalen Sucks with some power. And Steve Flipper and Finchita. So it's a 58-50 time. Wagner. Nick Richards got away with one. Oh my goodness. One bell, Parker Jr. This is getting good, Bill. Orlando has not subbed out here in the third quarter. They played nothing with starters for almost eight minutes now. And Wagner's figured it out. Wagner surrounded by five. One on five. Oh my goodness. Or it's lifted by another day, down five. Or done. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Carefree. They were your friends. Butterd is behind the horse. Bunkero answers. Good job. Bunkero wins it on a Wagner. Hold Anthony. They really did a really good year. Oh, Bunker. The older one comes in. He's hiding in the corner. Hold Anthony. Three pointers for the forward tar deal. Shot's there. You can grind it out to get a win here. Partets begin the fourth quarter with Grand Play. Meachage Nick Richards, Dabi Burkdaz, and Brandon Miller. Meachage up and in. Meachage wheels are on, Movonner of the LePanda. And he throws Wagner with a look of the eyes before he put it on the floor. Wagner got an easy layup on top of Great William. Anthony Engel, Movonner, Lack and Isaac. Movonner. Give it to her. Or will he just lay it in? That ball went off the Richard's leg. It'll call the kickball this time. And Isaac. And Anne Watt, number two today. Miles Bridges back to the scores table. Movonner. Like look away and get himself his second stuff tonight. Engel's Lack. Movonner, Cole Anthony, Jonathan Isaac, playing together. This is Cole Anthony. Oh, it's just going to spot it here out. Great thing about that, man. All right, I got a late 23 here. I got a late 3-4. They're here in the fourth quarter. Brandon Miller. Another three-pointer for Brandon. It's three of the night. And Trayn. There it is. Where to go? Kid's in the equation. Get the man in one. Well, that's German. What are your work? How about that? Look. Anthony Black, a whole partner. Oh, my goodness. Yeah. Total monkey arrow. He is one strong umbrae. Finally, some ball to Miles Bridges. This is Thorntfield goal. And Franz Wagner. Wow. That's impressive. Yeah. The sport next time we'll see him in the short pants is going to be on Friday in Washington to get to Wizards. And he has a couple of days off since the All-Star play. Brandon Miller, he's now got 18 points. Limited his shot attempts. Yeah. The way Miles has struggled, you'd like to see Brandon up around that 20 attempt bar. Now they've won three in a row. I thought about how important this is. Only half came up with my amy. Thank you.
