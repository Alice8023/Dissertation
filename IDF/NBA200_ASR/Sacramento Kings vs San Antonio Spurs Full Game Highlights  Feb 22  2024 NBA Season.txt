 You ready? You game? I'm game. The wing span here is jumping it out with the monsters of bonus who are underway, King's basketball, to start the game. Free throw line extended. I think you're doing your job at your Delma. Good here, Fox. Nice little time. You're finding a big fellow on the inside. When you're playing against a guy that has an impact like Victor Women Yama. I mean, you've got to still play your game. And I think the Kings are very disciplined with that. There he is. He's on the board now. Victor Women Yama. You can't absolutely be aware, but you don't want to force things. And right there, that's Domo's game. And he is so good with his fundamentals, even against a shot locker. There he is, trying to go right out of lose his control. So hand with the steel, three Jones in transition. Back out to Wimby Yama. The seventh three. Oh, look, look away. Wow. Great pop of it. Having some words there for John Butler in transition. But it's too easy, right? That's a big fellow. What's the gizmo? Yeah, hello. Yeah. You look at how they're playing. Every single one of their field goals is assisted at this point. Five assists, five main field goals. And that is the stamp of a break possible to see from here. To take a two point lead, Mike Brown goes with Alex Lind now at the center spot and A-Len immediately gets on the board. Alex Lind with the rebound off that Zach Collins miss. Things and spurs knotted up at 18th. Here's Fox. Hit the B-Bug on him. The air box out in. It's been a little bit puzzling, but a lot of it is, okay, if you're going to close out hard on somebody, you've got to understand it. You've got to close out hard to avoid the shot, but also have to be able to recover and get past. Here's Fox getting his first break as we have a King substitution. We're on to you by speedy. When the time for a change, the speedy will change. The mother showed me just the oil change. Do you have a great expert? And a few of them wide open. And that one right there, three-liles still down there. And you've got to be better in that area. Awesome. And again, what a pass from Kelden Johnson. Underperforming and top is going to go with you working well. The bonus extra pass. Herder, three ball got it. Look at him. He's leaking out there. Runs to the corner. Here's Malik. Malik decides to pull. Yes, sir. Back to back dribbles. But it came. He's so good at that. So good. Yes. He's going top now. Here's Shady Odsman. Pull ahead to Steve on the women. Yeah. He created that on his own. Yeah. Is this really getting a tap on that? That was pretty close. That was impressive. So now with 14. Herder being wild. And he's back. He's in double figures. In my day that sometimes when someone gets hit on it like that, the best thing you can do is a really nice hard bow. Just a reminder. It's hard to find consistency and flow when your minutes have been really all over the place that he looks good tonight. Yes, so does that guy. You talked about stepping yourself right now. Four days, blocks, Malik. You haven't heard her? 9-21. Yeah. You look at the flip side. Five of ten. What's the fall? You know. There he is defensively. Straight jump, eight on the clock. Straight fighting soul. So hand. Oh, there he goes. No more skits underneath. Two guys on him. To the south of the back there. He's pumped. Gains up by eight. Time your largest speed of the game. Let her minute to play here in a second. Oh, Wimpy Yama. That was a close. Eating five triples. Shot clock now down the four. Champendi. Oh, he went for a poster. Look how quick that ball is popping through. Yeah, very good. Champendi has eight. Here's five. You say a mouse in the house. He's doubled. There was a way. Turn over Sacramento just there for it. Here comes so hand. No Wimpy Yama. Yes. 21 assists on 30 major vehicles. It is first team who come in second. And the league in assist. That's a scoop by trade Joe. They come to spurs looking to take the lead. The south. Three ball. No. Come on to subundis. With his force. Rebound. Touchdown. Murray. The development that you're. Absolutely. Because we did not see him dunk the ball last year. I think he had around 30 low 30s in the entire season a year ago. So yeah, it's the development. Look at that. It's the rim on that one. Kevin Herder with the rebound. Black Falcon now in transition. Takes the bomb. Oh, pretty move. And finish from Harrison Barnes. There's three. He's safe. 78. Seven. No. Oh, a lot of contact. And one. He's a big mark into his own bench. The monster subundis rips that one away. It's 5-4. The monster is rippin' right here. Oh, he's not the minute strike. Come on, highlight real plays there by Sacramento. Still only a six point game now making four. As there's that man again. The monster's been dealing with the shoulders for a while now. But you haven't heard him say a word about it until that comment. That is his last five games for five. And look at that. Steal. Believe. Proud. Coming to his feet. Hammer top. Games up by 11. Largest lead of the game. Sohan, oh wow. What a 10. Solid clip at the free-proline with that. Better than 776. That good nine-point game. Believe one more game. Sohan. Wow. Jeremy Sohan. Shetty Osman. You got to wonder if the games are going to be able to do the same thing here in the fourth that they were able to do. The second game, separation, a lot of the games. Because the deer and box kind of ran for the things up. Now, what's the box out on with the game? Yeah. Right there. Brilliant job by the games. Look at the deer box. It's back in the back. Boxy. Hi. The ground. Only out of the trench arms and wimpy. You system, you turn it still. Yes. I put the over here. Well, the big problem with that and the last team is helping Johnson be able to get that in order to go right there from the low block. The worst thing you can give a young team is confidence in the fourth quarter. And there's a turnover by the games. In transition. Malachai, Bradham. Yes. Now, let him make some good decisions offensively. Boxy. Doubleed on the inside. Alex Lynch, saying with it. Second effort by Aiden Lynch. Has gone on to coach the aces in one two-use straight titles within. But she's a, I think, going to be a great influence in someone working with Wembe Niano. That she was such a skilled big. She's a fantastic job. With the stocky cakes. Big hugs for my girl. Oh, there's the one who was screaming at this. Al-Elite. Stand with the nose. Yes. Demonsa Sabones with the tip in. He's trending towards a triple double as Gorte No. In transition. Oh, man. There were three spurs back. It really is what it's about. I mean, it's been beautiful to watch. You look at the highest cis game right now. You've got 31 assists. Right about. Yeah, I mean, it's seriously. It's just, if there hasn't been a lot of resistance for either team, King's sitting on 25 assists, that was the 32nd for the San Antonio Spurs. Oh, back to back, no. King. That's something we see in our squad with the Monks' supporters handling the rocks. Look at that. We've been from the guard. Oh, he put Zach Collins on the three to play now. So hand being a pest versus the turnover. When Miyama hacked that one, wow. It comes to sell. It's caught up in the air. Great Joe trying to sneak the baseline. Shot clock at three. The sell got it. Big three. My God. You can have to go my screen. So bonus has to kick it out. Fox. Step back. Set the feet. Three. Half. Money. Number five. Let's look at four. Five. 160 to play. Ooh, five. Ooh, five. Pigeon. Take it to you for the air. One possession game, however, five. Four forty times. Yes, sir. One through the thirty two and twenty three. As they begin to post all star breaks, Chris. With a lighting.
