 the last week in March and you get one of the toughest practices all season long, but it speaks to the team's face and a counter of the NBA. And it comes off screen early. And K-Way, trust me, this time of the year, you need to earn his ankle now. We had a Jalen Green to lose this struggle, but he's got a degree of confidence against these suns as we saw in the last season. For beyond the arc of the season, it's really struggled over the last several games as well. Full of three is Pukka, left-sand, two to knock down. From three. Learning with 49 for sets on the season for Chittiesville. The league in three-point, two days great, with a step back free. He's got two early. And guys, guard, I'm going to like he's dancing with him. He's always looking for a new dance partner. He's green. Anybody gets some separation there against Donia? But he's trying to shoot it the way he knows he's very accurate with it, as he is with 11. Pukka says, well, I hit the right hand. Like Nerkis got that old man Dirk's grip. That's different. Gokka, a haunting another three, and he will get it. Dore, you've got to be defensive with it. Boba, top, Vanille lost a handle on that one, son. They were able to generate the turnover. Vanille finds hope. And he comes in with the figure of Rowe's team game. Six threes. Both with 15, giving 17. That's a mile. And you know the joy of the new, Hanley. Understands his role. Skip the pass over the top of the defense there. Saban Leone the drive. Beautiful. Red Hurts, top finish from Saban Leone. He's the first for game on the drive and kick over the green who fires the triple. Oh man, I like that. Well, the three in the quarter. There's your answer. And there's the results. Boom. Randle the drive drops it off the droop. Heavy traffic has it ripped away. I brought the ball down. It's done for Lucky Whipmore. It's inside the left lane. Shot it better. When they did the early forces of the season. Pocket pass. Sliding through. Delivers that hammer on Smith. You've been the floor in front of the official. The Rand walking into the triple. Buckets. Time out Houston. This. Bulls 25 and 14. Leaves backfires that one. It's going to be ready to shoot. Bulls still hesitant at times. The only rockets player double-figured with 10. Looking for another three. It'll get another three. This is way back to the scorched table. Sun's turned it over. Three. Jamrs it home. And this is exactly. So this is going to culminate into a wide open shot. Suns have already matched their 3.0 knockdowns on Friday night. But Jalen Green, doing everything else. Scored the rockets. Twenty to seventeen in that opening quarter. Merrick's on the roll slips inside. It gets the easy two. Rockets that into this green. You got to defend him. Make someone else beat you. Comes off the screen. Another knockdown. Green and numbers here. Two made advantage. Booker rising up. Gipsens side left hand. They'll get the finish in the foul with that one. What it is he could be talking to them about. Van Leaves fires off the three. His first made three of the night. In the final quarter. Yeah. Doesn't matter. Ken Whitmore elevating on the baseline. Suns with the steal. And you don't want to see it pitching. Green on the drive. Elevates in traffic. Can't get it. Suns. Transition opportunity. Elevates fires from distance. Connects. Definitely newer. Just doesn't get a lot of it. I think while it's those these really improved defensively. Brooks on the left hand. That's tough. That's tough. That's tough, huh? I thought I'd go more. I get that. Pull on three. Hold the pose. It's a deck. Overhead to Green. Step back real in the way. No. He's going to be about O'Neill. Lost the handle and an easy doose. For Dylan with his team trying to stress the importance of second chance points. Is Shindun again. As continued his battle with Nirk wins that one. A problem for them and they're lost to Oklahoma City on Sunday. O'Neill. Squares and fires. Connects. He's in Allen. Locked down. He's in huge shot after another and conjuncts you with Nirk. And his double double is Shindun showing off his offensive. You push. The man working on the youngster green gets with that left hand. He can't stop that. He's in opening goes on the attack. Nirk with the mismatch inside. Finish to the foul. There's a little mouse in here. The man who said he'd never play any beating. Green hits the brace. Good help defense from the red but green. Draw into double pass in the high post. Nirk working down low. Back to back turnover. See if we're Phoenix. Van Leach's to his way right to the cup. I love the offensive play. On the cut. Katie. The ball. 18 assists with the sun. Only nine for Houston. He's coming off a 32 assists. Is. The island green connecting on his sixth three. That matches the. Well for scoring first. Here. He used to. Katie of the pull up for the face of green. Is there an holiday back on the floor? Green on the drive and chip. It's up the rookie Kim Whitmore. Close to the basket. They want to be holiday to the loose ball. They want to drive drops it off the ball. Pull. It's the wall. You're such a soft shot. You have any other kind of bars you want to go in? You know, it's early. You want to drop them on one little stretch. So it's the bar in the end of paint. Rebound land. The length of the line. They'll push it under the corner. The ball. It's the pass. The land double baseline. Trying to push the lead back to double figures. Katie with a nasty crossover. Finish it off. Whitmore puts it on the deck again. Spins on Allen. Those blasts. Six from beyond the arc. Knocked down six Friday nights. Shedgurr on the drive and kick. Steps up the three point. And knock down for Jibari Smith. His first on five attempts. And at the six point game. Booker squares and fires. Working on Whitmore gets to the left hand. Loads it off the glass. Nurgings. Clear the inside. Hooks it back. Hook the finish in the foul. He needs to just bring that ball close to his body. Never happened. Man, believe that somehow got the shot up and in. Get the cooperation with the rockets bench. Nurg on the roll. Takes it to a kneel. Gets it back. Fires. Flash down. Nine point seven assists. Five rebounds. Three steals. Filling up the box score. That is Royce O'Neill. In an upsellers. Land down with the offensive put back. And the foul. Land down. Lots of points on the floor here tonight. To lead by a dozen. Man, believe that Sony triple. We can't like place too much time with the clock. Man, believe trying to stay at task. Both teams again in the bonus booker with a puller. Thirty five for books. Two minutes. The intentional foul game should come to an end. Man, believe that can't connect on that one. But the tip in by Landel. Will. Just to figure it out. Bring the double. Allen. Square. Fires. Rinddown. Wow. A rare off shooting night for Grace and Allen is. They have Whitmore come flying in. Well, for the second straight meetings. They have held the stunts to 40 percent shooting. In the field. Even closer now. Hey. It's too late. I'm not sure if it's the 40 percent shooting. In the field. Even closer now. Hey. Jalen Green.
