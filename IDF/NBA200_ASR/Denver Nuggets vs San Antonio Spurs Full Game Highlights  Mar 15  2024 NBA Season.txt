 We'll get one more. You ready? You game? I'm game. No, I'm not. I'm losing time. Spur, first touch for Yokich against Wembe. Imagine up, Yokich fully's in bright into the key. And Wembe blocks it. Now, Wembe Nyama, covered by Gordon at the moment, inside, and the ball was deflected or blocked by Yokich. Nuggets on the run into the front court. Now, Gordon into the lane. And he puts it away. The Nuggets have tried to bully ball Wembe, won't they? And Tip by Yokich. Great play by Yokich. Look at that. That's a highlight play. Yokich's doing it all, Tipping, Tapping, Towing. Yokich's going to take the three over Yokich. Got it. Nice. Three. It's under the quarter. He's alone. And he drops it in and a foul. Gordon's trying to tap. No, so hands got it. Corner, trade. And Trey not see it. Champagne. Nope. Wembe open it top with a reach. Champagne, try it again. Got it. Yokich's going to test his floater tonight with the lane of Wembe Nyama. Murray should have the advantage. Give it out to Yokich. He's going to shoot a three. No. He comes and he's got a lane and he drops it in. Yokich just out of the reason. He'll be just. Nice move. So hand has it and he lays it up in the end. Spurs play hard. That's the one element that they have. Porter pulls up and hits. The Michael Porter Jr. gives the Nuggets a 22 to 14 advantage. Now Yokich showers it up. Yokich's 30. Nine points in the first meeting. Now Reggie Jackson has come on and he throws the three. Here's the confidence back for Reggie. Reggie's got it. Snap it ahead. KCP. He got a 12 footer. Got it. And the Nuggets are running the spurs. Picking their heels, they'll be like. And Yokich's a little fancy footwork drops it up and in. So that's 15 now for Yokich. Now Collins in on Yokich. Collins turns. Shoot. That's the opposite of it. Inside. Get the back of Yokich. That's hit him in the knee. Oh, and under the Watson. Who puts it up in hand? How about Reggie Jackson? And he saw that cut all the way. Yokich Christian Brown. Alley, oh, Watson. Now Murray gives trade jokes over Jones. And he can get that over Jones. He's got the distinctive sized advantage. And credit to the new boss, Kevin Dema. Jones has it. And son, Nuggie sends it back out to Holiday. Oh, Holiday had a vacation and he missed it. Watson. Over with, what would be locked in? Nuggie comes up with it. Brown for three. Get it. Well, some crazy plays that are ended up with some good finishes for Denver. Let me get straight away. Three guys. Watson on the dribble draw. Spins in the lane. Give it a Christian draw. Another block shot. Now Murray back it in. Got an easy look in the shot. And that's there for Jamal Murray if he wants it. Nuggets. Got a 20 point lead for the 17th game this season. That is the Spurr score. That's a good back to the basketball. Now corner three on the line. That's good. Now let us do Gordon. Nuggets. Wanna run? Give the Christian Brown. Y'all for the way. Spurr's defense much better as you know when Wimba and Yomba is in it. That's for 18 to 18 so far. Which he's got it in the lane. Little shot is good. Jones. Here's this guy. Stop from that one. Yokits. Inside. What's it up over there? We asked Michael Bologna about that. Everybody got here on a bus. And that's a Vaselle from the corner. Restly's on the line. Inside the Yokits. KCP on the cell. And the cell scores again. That's a tough shot. So hand for three. That's amazing. That shot everyone goes in. What video of the Spurr's and most teams just left him shoot on the outside as the Nuggets get too bad. So hand. The Spurr's by Gordon. And everyone makes resistance. Jones on the run. So hand for the way. Yokits. One on one against Wimba. Wimba. Dump it under. Gordon. Yes. On the reverse. And timeout call by Greg Povovic. Chris Marlow with Scott Eastings and Victor Marty. One on three is on the way to the cell. Yokits is on the run. Get the porter for three. Can I get a hallelujah? And then have seven four coming run at you. They just shoot you with confidence. 67-61. They're going to get the Yokits. Here he goes. And Yokits is up and in. That'll work. Like that play with Gordon Hand. Look at you on the run. Floterova Wimba. Got it. Yokits gets a kind bounce there. 71-63 Nuggets. Oh, gosh. Oh, my gosh. It's so sweet. Porter's got it. Scoop it to Gordon. Oh, no, Gordon give it. And take it. Oh! And Michael Porter. Junior and Lower is the proof. Passing on Yokin the lane. A speedy Serbian right there, right to the rack. And Collins up. Keldin Johnson has range in the Yokits. And raising up. Wesley driving on Jackson. Waltip. Porter might have it there. Keldin Johnson straight away. Three. That's good. Collins goes for the steal. And Halleode for Watson is a beauty. And a foul. Collins with three. Barlow. Keldin Johnson inside. That's good. Inside. Got it again. Keldin goes up. It's 31 now. Final six seconds. Murray behind the bat. Take the shot. Who does? Halleode, a pizza fork. And he nails it. Keldin Johnson on the dribble drive. Here he comes again. There he goes. And he lays it in. And he's just going to try. And you got to know that. Christian Brown with a powerful dribble drive. And he lays it in. And this is the Christian Brown. We saw a late last season playing with big confidence. Return. And that's his shot. Jamal Murray. Brandon's going to take a shot. And he lays it in. And he just lured his head to clear space. Under the brown. He's got Wembee there. Give it to Halleode. Halleode cracks up another three. And he nails it. I hope this is any better on the moon. Maybe. Now just get a stop. Give it to Brown. Christian coming in. Side swipes are your own. It puts it in. Murray put it up. No. Got it back. Oh, he lays it in. Murray looking for eight thousand. And he's got it. Jamal Murray achieves a milestone. Jamal Murray gets somebody involved. Inside. Okay, let's hear it. A little better. Over the top. Peyton Watson drops it in. Watson. And Halleode out to Murray. He shoots the three. That's good. So, hand. Go ahead. In on Najee. So, hand no. So, hand yes. So, hand no. So, hand yes. He just threw it up to himself. Yeah. I think you have to care for that. Peyton Watson. Watson. Full pack. Baby. He's got it. Christian Brown. Can a challenge Wembee? No pass it up. Under Tom Najee. He call it's campus. Texas Longhorns. And somehow Wembee rescues that pass. Good. Good. Christian Brown. Halleode out there. And he puts it up in here. Good luck. See? What's the block? And so hand puts it in. Watson springs and loses it. So, hand blocked by Watson. See it Peyton? He got the clogs on your side. And then Yammer still in there. Jones is still in. And then the over the top. Great friends. Great pop of edge. And Michael Malone. Pop of edge. Helping Malone early in his career. Thank you.
