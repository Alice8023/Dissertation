 You ready? You game? I'm game. You can't have time for excuses. You have to hit the ground running and beat sub 500 teams. It is controlled by Houston. We talked about when this team has a defensive power. As far as getting deflections and being disruptive defensively. Great start. And Brooks gets the look. No, last game he had 40 on the pebbles. In late March. Z got bumped and let it go. And Gillib Brooks got away with one there. They're going to allow Gillib Brooks to get away with a little bit more. Because he's smaller in stature. We know how that works. Gengo. He's got a triple. And he's a low percentage guy from that. Very much so. Brennan had 45 as far as over. A little bit short because he's going back. That's the goal. You got it. One point in. Stay as it won the lead for the pebbles. Fan fleet. What an atmosphere tonight. Be good. This game. It'll be Jabari Smith struggling from there. But get some. Pels give up the most three-board attempts in the lead. But as Z. Shares the onus looking for three. He's three-simple. He got hit on that ball. Yeah. They're let it go. That's what a man tops. It's great at taking the ball. He's great at. Yes. Now, they try to get there. Good job by Horde. Yeah. A little bit strong. Now, CJ, smaller man on it. Go. Yeah. Three-reference, how well, youngest play. When he's two-sees met on January 31st, great play by Jose. Yes. Now, as he played very well too. And an easy one for Thompson. Top break after a good stop. But here's the kick. It comes late. And Naji. Four to three. Got it. Great pass by Z. Well tied. Great pass by Z. Here's the assault. Oh, man. Yeah. You don't have a choice but to respond. Good set up. Catch and shoot. You said it's old. Good set up. You know the hot catching shoot. Hard off the heel. Green clears it away. And linking out Thompson for easy one. Didn't have four-balance defensively. They're not calling defensive freeze tonight. We know that. Thompson will spin. And go take that's what he's good at. You got it. That is a heck of a move. Get into the rack. Now, as he ever gets dealing Brooks to switch. That's what he has to do. He has to do. There you go. There you go. That's what he has to do. They can't miss from beyond the arc. Nine of 16. Jose's a crease. Got to the hole. It is stress-free playing with stars. Almost taking a left. Fan flee. Left to way. He's high on from behind. And let's see. They is in Gordon in a shot-cloth violation. They've got seven points. CJ. And Jose. Beautiful bounce. Jose. That's what I mean. That's what I mean. That was it. The loser landed mid-range. Jabari Smith. And the honest gets the board. It's going to be a good look. It's going to be a good look. It's going to be a good look. That's a good look, Joe. That's a good look, Joe. Comes a double. It comes a double. Trying to get into the paint. And the honest. Jabari Smith. Dylan Brooks. Black. Bachengen. Captain Alive. CJ. Watch your hand. Watch your hand. Watch your hand. Watch your hand. Watch your hand. How did it go? The corner. Ten more shot-cloth. Tray has got to make a decision. That is a deep one. Got it. Shooter, shoot, Joe. That's a big one. That's a big one. I don't care if he goes over five. Bantley put it out there. And Z got it. He had turned it over already. But they didn't call it. Now, he'll call it the run. Well, this team looks athletic as I don't know what tonight. Only a new audience. Well, point game. And I'm hungry. Now Z. Off the bit. Max Flatt. That's tough, man. That's tough. So Don Nelson would have been happy because he wants a hundred jobs in the old days. Now Z on the run. I think it's Dylan Brooks. He got there. And then this is what we talked about. He's going to have to play through. Dylan Brooks trying to stand front of Z. Right. Just go through. Go through. There's nothing they can do. And Bantley, the couple of threes. CJ coming up short. Kill. And Green picks it up. And then it a game of it before the bells. And Green's going to what a finish. He thought he was followed from behind. Wanted to go inside. Family stake it away. Now Jonas cornered three. How about her? Good luck. I'll tell you. It makes such a difference. They got the switch. Now Z, you're coming to double. And those are Green's. CJ, that guy, Bantley. We had a ride to this eight ten header. Torture table. Designs up to 22 and 76. That's what they're trying. It's another block by trade. Ten of the shot clock. That door. CJ's got it on his back. Midrange. Go to the line. Take it so smart. It takes a while. Right now, okay, season anomaly. CJ's floater. It's suddenly the switch. It's a great double by magic. Very well tied. And Jen will get the finish. I don't blame her though. He didn't want to point five coming to her late. Four to play in the third. What a third. CJ over the longer Smith. Got CJ McCogum dance class. It's going up. And with the left head to strong. Shendon clears it away. Give it away, boy. Don't have to twice. Bantley. Thompson no more to shoot out there. No, he does not. And there's Josep of the seal. He's got hard. They'll get it back himself. Right. Right. That's a right move by Nazi Marshall. Whitmore. He's going to hold. Down to 22. It's a quick recovery. So it's four to six weeks. Trace got a good look. The top that's up. Need him tomorrow night to hit those. No question. Terry over. Her season up. Got it up short on a deep three. Aaron Hobbit clears it out. And Thompson will get the finish. Yeah, that's pretty amazing. And what are the odds? Z, go boy. And then you can do. Jason T. Heroes his way home. He sees reading. And get there again. What's up? And it works. It's a kilo nil, barbecue ticket. And then he goes to the end of the night. The 26 points end of six. The 12 of 19. And by his standards, that's not a great percentage. 12 of 19 because he spoils us. That was not 14 of 36 on Earth, so. That's why folks are going to do what he's always done. You've got to read you book. Whitmore on the jump stop. And what are you going to do? No, we won't. We're going to have to give the second chance, though. We're going to give Jason T. Tom Shies. And it'll be picked up by David. This is a thing. You can't allow this to me. And the shot clock Thompson has to make a decision. And he's going to get the vibrates. Z up against Londale. It'll be her. I see. Joe has been phenomenal tonight on both ends of basketball. Here he is again. On the floor. Here he is again. Heather's steel for her. And trail on the fence. I don't know how many steels that is for her. It's on the six deals right now for her. And it matches his career eyes. Thompson runs the baseline. But he can't Whitmore rather runs a bit. And he can bring it back out, by the way. Glad to see you again to finish. Once what they won on the board. Ten of the shot clock. And hot. She worked real short. Goaties got to go. It never touched her in. So, Oh Zola. Alright. It's over. Calls split this season series. More importantly though. They got truckies. Thanks for watching.
