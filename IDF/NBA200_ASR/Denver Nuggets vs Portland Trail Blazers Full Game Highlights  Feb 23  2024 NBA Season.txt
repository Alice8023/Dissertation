 You ready? You game? I'm game. My bad was it too. I'm way younger than so. A phenomenal performance in an NBA record performance as well. Blazers with a tip. Murray getting a nice save from eight. They swing it outside the grand for three. And that's a great way to get this first quarter underway brought you by. With dough and low sight of what you see from Tumani when he takes up that way, he blows it. Wow. Because every time Tumani gets on the floor. But what a spectacular move by Murray. Deep pose. Eight in the catch the turn. And wheels in the 10th butter. He wouldn't start for the blazers too much. Yes, he wanted a d8. Was calling Tumani. With the pass before to airboard, he threw him open. Where it didn't even look like he was open. At the time the ball was released, but. Yoke is as good as they come. Up to Florianne's early transition looks to Gordon. Trying to swatter away with Graham for covering the goal of Gordon. Muscles is way to the cup later. Simon snaps off a deep free that comes off long. There goes across the run. Order shield. Simon's from the ball. Sealed it and got the lot open. It's always said the open area test. Yoke is operating up top. Hands to Gort, a little pick and roll. And he comes to lay it in. Took a time. What it didn't feel like he had it in his hands enough to catch a goal up with it. Immediately. When it's his own pace. There's a lot over the top. Rebound deflected by eight good play. But Murray has it ripped away by Yoke. Out of head to Gort. Sight steps of man knocks. Simon's down. He threads it outside to Porter. Caches in. He's going in length at a double take. Get it out of his hands. Fibolue checked in. Cross for eight. John Tannis and another nice beat from eight to Kamara. It goes to Annie. His dad was a one time trainer here in court as well. And up in Seattle. Walker drives it into the paint. Sets his feet and lays it up in it. He's another legacy guy. And except for five defensive play by the Blazers, he had an easy doose. Grant the other way. We're all dead. Watson rejects it at the buzzer. Wow. What a play from what? Yeah, it looks like a two three. But they got their wing go pretty high. And it's all the trigger in a three. That's you, the reba. That's a reload for the two hand. Don't put your throw bars on it. Malcolm bragged it out tonight. And it's no further notice with a wrist. And Scoot Henderson is sitting tonight. That opens up minutes for a bandit to show what he can do. Now Grant is just tied up there. That was terrific. He's trying to get up a shot. Wow, it's the traffic. Finds an eye to you at the rim. But the A has really stepped in there like he wants the ball. Outside, Cornwall Pope triggers. Don't let Anthony Simon get to the basketball. And even times an end does get it. Cornwall Pope is still there. It comes up into his chest and off the left foot, six one. Simon's the other way. Got jared by Yoke. It's coming. And he's in the line. Also, if you have to put a cap on that, that's for kids to know who want to be a part of the game. If you can't be an Anthony Simon, it's because that's up to me. Does it have your signature on the inside of it? It can. Very good. There's going to be a 90-100. The last three, Bale's at three, drifting out of the wing. And he was surprised by the option to let's be chose. Simon shifts gears off the ice. Grant drives it right at Yoke and slay it. Those are the kind of layup. Oh, that was a good one. Yeah, they got away with one. No, they didn't. And Davies called Wall Pope the long rebound. There's four pieces of sheds. Grant. And hammers in a two-hand jam. Good look on the spin move by Heath. And Murray's attempts. Rolls off on the offensive rebound. Five seconds left to this half. Simon's the full up. This cast is good. 15 footer for Simon's. I was going to ask him for the birthday just like every Tuesday. It's all about the never-toothed day. It's royalty Tuesday. Speaking of royalty, here's Yoke. It's high bank up and in. And the skill set. Grant nice bounce. Eight. We're going to ball move. And then bat them easy. Three out of the corner wise are in the height. 20s and about 28%. Here's Yoke. Double. Adjust with to the side for Gillespie. Locks down the trip. That's because he has been deserving since day one. Thank you, Brooke. We're patiently waiting. If Yoke had spins in to lay it up in there. Back people now play back to the basket post a play. They like that. So they want to give them those positions. Wow. Ready pass. You know, I know. Here in partnership with the Blazers and the last airlines. The last airlines flew them up for the weekend. That's to be a part of everything going on. Yes, it is. But the march is told if they're performing tomorrow in Junction Ab, which is a black business event hosted by S.E.I. here in town, so from half. But. One minute left here in the third. And drives in. He was off balance. He did a great job to adjust and lay it in. Horsing the hand of Gillespie. He is knock on his keyster, ball jabbed into the corner. Reeth is after it. Gillespie with a kick. Hands to Yoke. It's off the shot. Scores were 26 seconds left in the third. 95, 74 count. Seven seconds left. Third four. Slime and speed is off. The five will get off that shot. He will. It's a really back that I pinned in. Chris Murray in the hit post potential. Yeah. Yeah. Why do you like his potential? Something that coach Billum's described even before the game. They call him Mr. Perfect. For it's a veteran-laden team that is one of the top teams in the West with the blazes are striving to be at one point again. Chris Murray can play in either of Llanas. The Lotto bat, man. I can't do it. You're fast to head up. Off the eight trailing. She's a wall. That's his spine out there in that key, man. He can make it happen. And he rules that one in. He's in whether the Jackson in the front court. Orner makes it cut through the formation. Here's the defense. And then Watson on the opposite side throws a three. He's at the hot hand. He got two blazers. Two react to him. Oh, Murray, look inside. And it's eight meeting it at the apex of the chairman. He can be an unbeatable screener in terms of the efficiency that takes place as a result of it. Oh, Naji with a beautiful recovery in the air, which can have two defenders to redirect us. Orner Jr. up the floor. Shoot some pants to Watson. Grab his own miss. We're leading out of the scramble. Twelve to shoot for Simon's to the baseline. Double outside to Grant. One on one opportunity. Go on and Watson. And he'll lay it it up in hand. And it's finally two diseases. That's asking a lot. Oh, great stuff, though. Thanks, Tom. Appreciate that. Down the bottom bar. Looks like the blazers in a zone looked at time and Jackson was able to split the two guards up top. He is driving that ship for the open seat thunder. To me, both ends of the floor. I think he's had the best season in the advanced stats of Bri on that. Interesting. Let's be on a runner. Score is here. Legacy doesn't play into it, but it does. He's a defending champion, defending finals champion. 436 left, 4th quarter. Simon's working with Burian 8. This green, why Simon's terms of corner, Yoke, which was a turn style. This is great for Ant to have these minutes. The same way it is for the young guys, who always talk about it. It's given the minute to explain as they're getting. 21 and... What other element about Denver that's so hard to do? How about this? Yoke, it's on the back row. It kind of gets to know what I was going to say. Who Murray was on another team, he probably beat one of the league leaders in pick and roll. Paul Handler's 4th. Good boy, Chris. Good finish. But only Sacramento went slow. He won lost or confused. He was just letting time tick off. No one that don't tell the time gets under two minutes here in a quarter. It will continue to go. So he burned seconds off. He's just a maniac. Waparita's demand with the handle. Old to lean in, rolls off to Monty Camara with a recovery. And the Belgian will back it up and in. On Alcy, the MVP in action again against these Blazes. And Juicy will have a lot of stake. How about that? They go big in a nice pool. Yes, very nice pool. They can just scoop pass. It's a mustard on it. We're never tied. Camara, a nice twist, turning away. And as he goes by the bend, we're in the holiday. And that now... Gibson, the franchise lead calf.
