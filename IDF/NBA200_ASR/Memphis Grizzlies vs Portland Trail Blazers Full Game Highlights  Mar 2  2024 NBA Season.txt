 Last match for Luis Enricoâ€”elu there's a wait and a standard at Which this hostage team expected to play assignments, players that out to be able to play by drop briefly not at 3 off the bat. I know anybody buys a lot of Laura. Any questions for Johnny Camara? I'll finish it in any other second round. As a rookie this year, it's trying to turn this corner. Leaves in the lane, faces up those in the corner. So, we're going to do a more ball and Austin gets to defense of Jeremy Grant. Grant hits the three. Jeremy Grant will finish.
