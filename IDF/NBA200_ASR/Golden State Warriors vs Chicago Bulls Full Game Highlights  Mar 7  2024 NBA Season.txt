 You ready? You game? I'm game. I'm the devil's the time. Hold. They can't play in front of them in the east and Kobe White. 39% on threes. He hurt the Warriors in Chicago. Frame on all the way to the rim. Each of each can shoot, particularly for a big guy. The average is 18 again. Japski, what a good defender for a rookie. He came more from the east side than the other. He has to dance. He's going to try to swing it. I heard that was on the threes. The player had a potential 37% on three this year. Mom corner three. Mom is the first quarter threes. Now defenders are closing out a little closer to him now. Kobe White all the way to the rim. This end though. There you go. Raymond fighting from the end side. The Warriors have settled from the break. Juppers and threes. Raymond, all these close outs. And then center Winkens out as well. They're flipping up at the end. And he's still going to run. He's head against Wulch. He's going to switch. And watch as the three run over. A little pick and pop. That was a good bootch image. Can get out there. And the corner. There is a three. The start of a game on a back-to-back matter so much. And the Warriors now are not letting nothing run. The bootch image just ends with the jumper. I'm going to deflect a good hand. Raymond open play Thompson through. He's got now. He's got now. He's going from the base line. He'll rattle that one out. Trace Jackson Davis is checked in. Play Thompson stay high. To play three on three on three. Wulch image is rolling. You see everything's out of pick and roll as picking pop. The team out of the corner. And he bottoms the three. And there is Gerosan drawing a foul and hitting the three. Experiencing that wrong. That's right. Don't do it once. Yeah. So Gerosan got going with that four-point play at the end of the first quarter. And hit the mid-range then. That's awesome. Well, at least it wasn't like on the log ride. Wiggins and it's on the mid-range again. Talked about the Warriors pushing it. And there is Demarder Rosen. Another three-point play opportunity. Looting. Got around the rows in it. Get home. He's in Moses Rooney. For the couple buckets off the bench. Wiggins. He could shoot over Javalle Conrad. He knew that. And your Wiggins as a. Under a little flip shot in the lane. He just attacked and awkward close out from Chris Paul. Wiggins missing that lane. Three-trace Jackson Davis. Gives Chris Paul another opportunity. We're just trying to be the more aggressive team. Alex Coruso. Deep two. The target's not shooting well. The Warriors have shot the three-ball much better than they think. DeSumo ties the game. He stopped. Got the body book. Made the bucket. Very clever opportunity for a three-point play. Loosso. Back to back jump. This one's a three. Corby White off the line. He flips it up on the end. And the drives are sitting up other drives. Aamon, sitting up that screen. Three-point range. That was it. The Rosen. Then take a lot of threes. But Demarder Rosen's got 18 in the first half. And the top of the cornering. It's a three. And Julian Phillips. He got for the final minute. Here, Corby Thompson's got 16. They're quite just slip out of him. Three-mon. Seven rebound. Seven to six. Seven points. The Uchubich. Lefty finger roll. Stash flips the double team. Get 10. And they've had success involving Uchubich in these ball screens. The double team and Garose at every time. Uchubich makes him bang with the three. Corby White with Tosimo. Uchubich promotes and now it's Peruso. Greenbob. What a great defensive stand there. Set away, Corby White. And that's the big one. And there's the naked handoff. And then there's the just straight line in the rim. He gives with the steal. Push ahead. Pajewski, one man to beat. He gets around Corby White to lay it in. Ruso does such a great job. He does. Locked on his body. Look. Ruso points for a second and Steph Curry happened. Uchubich and Garwiggins. And the post position. Nobody's beginning in the year. Uchubich has got to become a 75% free thrower. How about eight of eight tonight? Uchubich's stroke looks good. The Superm corner of three. Or is it half to go a long way to get to those shooters and stuff? To hit on three. Pajewski, around Uchubich to lay up and end. That's smart. And they're making him take much tougher shots now. The Minga in on Ruso. Lay in on Fennel again. Go Uchubich. He saw a broadcast partner, Hunter Pence, enjoying that. There he is. Ruso. He will pick up the foul and flip it in. He'll be lying out all the way to the rim. Steph Curry is going to use the timeout. That's just a blow-by. There was maybe going to be a screen on the other side. But the bulls keep coming. They're going to keep this game as tight as possible. Tough to get separation in this one. Steph, stop. Go, score. And he's just involving Uchubich again. Look at the collapse of Uchubich. Very grand. He took the shot blocker and traced Jackson Davis and set up Uchubich. Kobe White. Full of the statement. Kobe White. Chicago. Taking the lead with the Rosen sitting in Uchubich. And he started scoring at the beginning of the game. And he slowed down at all. Steve Curry is going to take a timeout. Chase Jackson Davis is first bucket of the night. Talked about the bulls and all their close ones. The sumo is another golden. Now say that two of them got. This ball to trace. And the trace had missed the free throw. Parked with a warm up three. And they're there. Is it? The team for three. Maybe a little bit of overhead. The Rosen. He launches in. From Dean. Shot clocked down to five. Just Paul little finger. They're playing it for the lob. He's like, I'm not stopping. I'm going to score myself. Rosen gave it up. Kobe White. D3. Wow. The Rosen from the corner. Hey. Bring my block that three. The Dremont Moody Chris Paul with Camiga for Jameski. And for Jameski. He's got 11 now. They're watching the film on the Warriors. We're expecting the split action. He's got 10. Lee Kaye, turn fades five. He's at home. He's unbothered. There's Paul Elbow-Jelper. There's Paul CP3 is five of seven. The bottom corner thought about that. Side step and makes it out of that. I'm going to hit that three. He thought about the foul line, Jepo Vouchavitch. He hasn't pulled off at all. 28. Vouchavitch knocked away. Moody. Moody in the front race. Moody will put it up in. They thought about that three. It'll be a top of the key. Jepo. Frozen. He hits the jump for draws of fouls. Stephan Moody played trace tax in Davis. It did it down. It's just too much for Moody to be deal with. Graves Jackson Davis on the hand. How did it sound to you? Look at the bench. Yeah, you can do that too. Ray Bond will cut his stuff. He's going to lay it up and out. But there's Camiga on the follow-on home. What? You thought a foul is playing to get Camiga the double? Ray Bond attacking. Ray Bond's kind of triple double. There's step. Going back to the locker room. Vouchavitch had a high-end all night. He burried the three. He's got a 31. He knocked about that jumper. Flank. It's half-fade firing. Jackpot could tense. He'll be by creating space and flips it in and out of the game. But Rosey gets Moody out of the switch again. Pants into the line and runs at home. This gets to his spot midrange. Rides up. But Jameski is back in. Play for three. He's out. Rosey again. He draws the foul. He flips it in. Bulls take the lead. Make it 31 for double D. But Jameski driving to lay it up and out. This the layup. And he got a foul. Vouchavitch right away. Vouchavitch farens the ball. It's just Paul looking. Looking. He'll get it back. Vouchavitch is Paul three. He got it. So you got a foul right away. Now you have a chance to throw it. It's got to be in the front court. It's got to be a three. Kenyones from Mid Court.
