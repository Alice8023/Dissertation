 The first game here at Target Center back on January 12th. He went over 10 in that game. So that doesn't help much. And then that second game important. He went four and fifth. Oh, one hand. Followed by Rudy Gobert. That's nice. Players going nuclear against Minnesota. They've had problems in games with all the world. And at home, they've lost some games. Guys going nuclear. Anthony Simon's gets one there. He's got to go. Conley turns it over. Murray, ahead to Simon's, stops, pulls, and hits. He's the head of the snake right now. Simon's. Man, five on the shock clock. Difficult pull-up over Edwards, and it goes down. This is McDaniel's on an island with Ben. A tag team and partially blocked it scored anywhere. Here's Simon. Yeah. On the move. Out to Reef for three, and it's good. Do not breathe. The rookie out of LSU. That's a nice game. It's important when it gets Minnesota as well. Extra pass. Now's Reef in the corner. Gets it to drop. 2-15 to go first quarter. Brown. And now inside easy lane. That's how you beat young players by sharing the ball, making them make decisions. Playing isolation basketball is just playing into their hands. Here's a nice set up. Special delivery. It's almost bit comical. But against the Kings, Murray didn't want. Powell had two and into quarter to choice. He did. Eight seconds. Inside. Brown got the lane. That's what he can do. Robert took a shot to the midsection. Portland's quickly the other way. This is Rupert for three. Check that. That was McDaniel. Brown. Cherpool. Got it away. Rupert driving and lane it in. It's going to be a dynasty now in Indiana for a little while. The Indianapolis there. They're going to have a great team. That was a great organization when I was coaching at the WNBA. That's for sure. Reef for three. Set up Anderson. On the move, driving the floating right hand. Simon's penetrating got the bounce. Against Minnesota through three games this season. More first field goal started over three. Conley. Bounce pass. Alexander Walker on the attack. Go bare. Got the handoff and threw it down. Edward's going to have to make a play in the paint. Kick out McDaniel's inside on a polgo stick. Simon's kept his triple and throws it down. What are my favorite all-time players? Tomorrow Crawford. All-time great guys. There's a lot of Reef. Brains another two days. And while Portland just 17 wins on the season. He's knocked out three-three. That passed stolen by Hagen's. Hagen's ahead to Murray. With a slam. Blazers within one. Shot clock winding down. Edwards. Driving. Stops. Off glass. Beat the clock. This has been a feisty Portland squad. Number two way guys. Looking to impress this Portland coaching staff. Suboring Walker following his own shot. Walker. Attacking towns. Kick out. Extra pass. Simon's scores. And then it's a double dip in LA. Towns. And the lane. Lane. Good. You know, playing hardest is the most important thing to me in basketball. Mike is done the bad way again. Mike gets, you've got to have more awareness from Carl. And from just anybody else, but Mike, should not be on Reef. Throw it down. Say the big Daniel. Simon's. Outside. Look for Reef. The Hutton's on the floor in the paint. Conley in town. Edwards on the logo. Driving. Frozen out. Conley. And the paint right hand. Deadly. What's this? The kill. Back in the game for Minnesota here. Simon's. Yes. Conley on the move. And turned it over. Here comes Murray the other way. Rayon won. Murray. Lays it in easily. Osworth just 16 assists so far on this ballgame. Ryan repair. Pull up over. Towns. Dranks it. 75. 69. Came all the way back. Forced overtime. And pulled it out. Go bare. Get out the way. Another one opportunity for the big fella. Under five minutes to go third quarter. Murray. Drinks it's right. In the six attempts. For the Blazers. Those of the Miss Firey from the line. You're taking Mr. Cumpull and a town. That one right there. What a fish. Byin for the Simon's. And that first half. Simon's three more. 21. Grand Prix Simon's. Slow mo. Inside. Go bare. Easy lay. See if the walls can have a strong close to this third quarter. Simon's elbow jumper is pure. Outside the reed. Repair. Finds Murray for three. Too strong. Three bound. Go bare. Quickly ahead to Morris. Dallas and the Walker. With the tenth of a second. On the third quarter. A clock. He's going to play, man. He'd love to play too much. To sit a game out. Go bare. Tounts both for the left. Go bare. Oh, man. That was. It's been night night for employee number five. No three. From Bemidji. Time out. Portland. Bounce pass. Inside. Go bare. Couple of fakes. Another flush. Same spot. Five points for Morris. The lead is below the 15. Rees goes. You mentioned that. That's where it gets. They are fourth in the NBA in a pwn internal parade. But the guy is going to play in the NBA. And a pwn internal parade. But the guy is going to put up those numbers. They're in street close. Yeah. Stolen. Cookies. Conley the other way. Over to Edwards. On the drive inside. And got the lay. This nine points for Anthony Edwards. He has the last five. Rupert squares up. Drains another trade. I love his post game pressors. Winter Lewis. The steel. Snowball. Get up. Oh. Bucket in the foul. And for these simons climbing the ladder. And it's been done many times. By the way. So. So we tied the record and then missed. And then missed. Snowball. Free ball. Last two games it meant this. This triplets are team. They're giving Minnesota the business. Like pass ball. Towns again. They're giving goal. Yeah. They're what that actually quite a bit. Three to the Ram. And got the lay. There were the nine. Walls. Walls trying to close the door. Get a regular season sweeper the blazers. Edwards for two. Edwards on the attack. Over to Anderson. Outside look. Pudley. Pass. Shaded sharp Malcolm Brogdon Robert. Wikens the third. Yes. So going. Simons has thirty-four. Walls dribble out the clock.
