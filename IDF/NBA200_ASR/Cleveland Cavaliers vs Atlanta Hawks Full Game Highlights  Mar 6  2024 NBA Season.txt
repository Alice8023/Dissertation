 You ready? You game? I'm game. These guys are jump shooters. Last night the Cavaliers scorched the Celtics with one team, three pointers, as they had that massive comfort behind win. Coppello at the high post, got back out to Bogdada Bich. Short clock here for the Hawks, Bogie gets into the paint, goes to the paid. That same pace does a nice easy shot for him. Neang, and they did not do a good job at transition that time. Alan, both of them really out that far from the basket. A Coral will fire in it. That's a good Coral. Deep weight on the roll, looks it up and in a final on Atlanta. Well, that's a nice pass by Alan. And a steal by Murray. He'll go in all alone and one handed. Garland, looks it back. A Coral, good, deep by Garrison Matthews, Fuban his feet. And a Coral just powered his way in. The Cavaliers are supposed to his Garland, like some three in hits him. He's another one you've got to be aware of, that's always there, ready to go. Hunter had it blocked by Alan. And that's where Alan is affected when he could come across. Here's Wade, and he's still hot for last night. Porter, Andy hits a jump shot. Like a three point game. And they are solvently in the playoffs at number three in the east this year. Jaylen. And that's his close bucket. Keras LeBurgs, box-scrant them defensively. And Mero putting that one up and missing. But order comes up in the loose ball and scores. Jaylen, moving in on LeBurg. Got Jones in the air and score. Nice patience by Jaylen. LeBurg, like a pass, Jones to Merritt. In the middle. And they're in with the jam. Distance. Here is Wade. I was blocked. Jaylen got there. Well, you know what you took off a grand. And you got a shot. And you got a shot. And you got there. Well, you know what you took off a grand. That he wasn't going to go at that. Trent throws it in. Nice back door and Porter the jam. Look at Bruno. Swish an addition. And this is the game against Cleveland in January, did he? At 18 against them in the two games. Look at Cleveland. And the Hawks need to capitalize off these bad shots here by Cleveland. Today, starting to get a cookin. Both teams on a back to back. Both tribal last night. But the Hawks look fresh and sharp. And they believe him does not. Quite sharp one. Especially after the first quarter. Murray Glass had good in another foul on Cleveland. Pull up for LeBurg. Sudie. Drive it in, scoring. Well, the Hawks just continue to Alan. Two strong, three-bound, a corrod no, tip-dot to LeBurg. Shumbles to Niaing. His three is good. The second three ball tonight for Niaing. Last night, the Hawks won in New York. The number of course see to the east. Chance to take down the number three scene tonight. But I mentioned that three-point shooting for Cleveland. Four for 19. That was one of Nikes' big points. Before the game tonight, to limit that three-ball for Cleveland. Capella. Wade is a guy who's strictly a jump shooter. Garland corner three. That's good. The Hawks need a foul here. Niaing will hit the three in the corner and Jalen is hurt before the elongated west coast trip. Rising up bogey. Well, the Hawks just continue to roll. See, that's the thing. Different than like a sedic in a way. If sedic isn't making that long ball, he gets to the rim and makes out. And one for Murray. In advance of the Vickichard Grayson game on set. He had a couple things to say. He said, yeah, you know, how about that for Keach and Team? I said move. Capella down the lane. Capella has had three buckets like that where he's been in traffic and been able to finish. It was leg-back Nick. I think that's the biggest thing. Wade with a dunk. Great she defended. Garland, want hands it off the glass. Gogey, low dribbles it into the land and gets away. Tonight. Here's Carous LeBurg, Lombog and Alan throws a down time out for Quinn of the Hawks. Go Kobe Puffkin. And now no Jalen Johnson tonight. LeBurgs. Coro, Trills of three. Coro, LeBurgs. This is the three ball you feared, Nate. Hunter. Harrison Matthews, big three. Stop the bleeding. Nothing that time. Garius Garland, back to Merrill. He's still no good. Good, but Alan is there to clean it up. 2015 left. Hawks are lining that good deed that they played earlier in the game but they can't stop Alan on the dog to the basket. Go Kobe Puffkin. Gogey trying to find a little room to operate. LeBurg lunges out if it can't stop the three ball. Gogey gave him too much room. LeBurgs. Coro, goin up. And Ducksett, it's filed by Bruno. Here's Kogan, Merrill defendant. Did he get the shot off? No. Trent Porist, hint of the pangs. Rock shoot hits. That's that aggressiveness down the corner. Off the screen knocks it down. This is a good looking kid here. I mean, not afraid of the moment. Good order. Nice move. Got him up in the air and scores again. He's starting to, you know, give his coffin his back. Let me a clock here. Don't turn on the reset down to six. Grabber out. Proto. Looks to drive. And Bruno takes it away from him off the dribble. City going in on Garland. Bay pressure from behind. Know it and still got the shot to go. Garrison Matthews. Lecord all over Buck Dottabitch. Boga goes in, goes out to Bay three on the way. Got it. There'll be no challenging that one. 100 to 93. Garland lobbing. Alim dunking. Too easy. Yeah. He's throws it in. He's playing so slow getting to that basket. One point for Boga to lead. All Hawks and Scores. Garland. Lobs it into the B.A. Just bully ball against Murray. Okay, put all that weight he had. 100. Nothing off the puff. Couldn't free himself from the first. Outside three for Boga. And a pick-off by a Coral. Cedig Bay. Off the double-team, Grillson. Back to back. Boga. Works and Bucidic. La, play in, Coppela feeding. Cedig Bay perfectly. Hunter. Hanks, Pets. Hawks. What 12-101? They got this win. Hawks just handed over to Neang. Nobody's going to do anything about the clock. Out it runs and the Hawks have the victory. The Hawks are going to be the winner. The Hawks are going to be the winner. The Hawks are going to be the winner. The Hawks are going to be the winner. The Hawks are going to be the winner. The Hawks are going to be the winner. The Hawks are going to be the winner. The Hawks are going to be the winner. The Hawks are going to be the winner.
