 The end side. McGayneal's good position on herner. Go to the reverse. Barbs. Kick out. Shot clock winding down on Murray behind the back goes to the left no the follow finish. Find the Monis. Subbonus. Subbonus. Gonna attack go bear. Wolf. Got the bounce. Subbonus is the kind of player that can give Rudy a hard time. He turns around tough fade ribs out. And Subbonus will bring it up. Subbonus. Average 1913 and 8th setting up herner for the track. Go bear trying to keep it alive. And Subbonus clears it for another rebound. He has four already. In the first four minutes of this game. Mark's wide open. Hit the track. Subbonus. Tough shot. All those handoffs those D.H. Josephs. He's same thing with Anthony Edwards. Downs. Backing down. Barnes. Short hook. Go. That's just a tip to say. Murray. Pediatrist. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Herta training and throwing it down. Little down ten. Mark biding the laden. Laneed. Hollow. hill. Who a good course sit back in the picture. He was not. down. They all the insmen there. and the King. Stack up 12. Four. Come on. Double plus, no, but right. Into the hands of Sabona. Gonna pin it straight. Blocked by Sabona's six on the shot clock. Two point drive. Montage together because there's a lot of them to pick from. Mont scores in the pain. Right side. I mean, he can do it left handed too, but from the right side, left side of the floor with the right hand. Oh nice ball-pank in the finger roll. Oh, Jay Macata plays the whole first quarter and will come in sometime around the seven minute mark. Just came back. Oh man, a lot of contact there. Should've been an an or one. Conflict. You can have sound screen and the teeth of the defense. Flips it up and in. How about that move by Minnesotale? Mitchell. It's up, Lane. Oh man, it's so hard when you're beginning. Edwards. Pull up for three. Bottoms. Look funny. Didn't have any of those funny moves. Edwards. Around the Govair strain. Freed up. Hits the J. Second chance points. Still an advantage for Sacramento 12 to 5 in the game. Barnes. Redid fall for the pump. No deer and fox for the things tonight. Savonis. 17 points. Monk. On the drive. Kick out the Barnes. Three ball deep. The ball goes down. And Sacramento. 1.9 on the shop block. Savonis. Wow. And got it back to Ellis. That was a. You can't take that shot. I mean, to me that shot is a bailout shot. Block by Govair. Unbelievable block. Sounds. Someone's got to be open. It's McDaniel's who's open. He's got to make a pay and they did it. Morris defending Mitchell. Savonis squares up. Trying to get back in the wind column. In a very tight Western conference. Apparently ain't the standings. Malik Monk. Monk. Pull up. And he's cooking. He's cooking. Mitchell. Miles looking for Monk cutting back door. He's not only sure what he's doing right now. Is he back in coverage? No one's covering for him. Read all the full penetrating. No, this is a matter. This may be the sort of table of things. See you're saying we got a chance. Is that what you're saying? Yes, Jim Keeer. The pull up. On the drive over to McDaniel's for three. Boom. Tows saw the help coming. He got rid of it quickly. Monk left hand scores. Very small simple size but the Timberwolves aren't being six and oh. But McDaniel's has at least 10 points and five points. He has 20 and six. Monk off to the races. Chris Finch calls time. And as the Kings go up, Nasri driving, spinning, lost it. Got loose with the handle. Ellis the lob. Monk to finish. Conley. Outside McDaniel's for three. Tows. Back to Conley. Oh man, that was an ATO chin right there. Monk off the heel. Ellis chased it down. Monk for three. Yes. Gotta get in. Rebound. All the misliniest stats. Sacramento's winning. Towns long range. The middle. Good switch. The cream switch. Conley all over Barnes who drains the mid-range jumper. You can't give up the layup. That's the silver line of that. Barnes can't hit. Herder the offensive board. Monk in the corner for three and it's gone. Conley will jab step outside. Look. Nasri. Go. Tap out by GoBand. Inside. Re big dinner. Monk the answer. Putting the Kings back on top. Now it's Re on Monk. Long distance three. The goal. At a bounds. 1.9 presently on the game clock. Conley. In the towns. Top turn around. No good. And put five more minutes. On the clock. Sacramento's zone it up. Making it hard for Minnesota with all the bigs on the floor. The New Courier high for David McDaniels. Murray. Followed up by GoBair. Now it's the bonus. Attacking read. Healthy Fitzcombs. GoBair took the shot. Who gave it to? Bonus. Browled letting them know. Good switch. Oh, Monk left open. Ties it up. Rudy was trying to tell Nasri to get out there but didn't tell him to sit in it. Two-tid to go. Monk three more. Yes, sir. He's been on real. 39 points. He nearly lost the handle. Drive-in blocked by Lyle. Over to Alexander Walker. Penetrating outside. Look, Nasri three ball. No. Lyle's the rebound. And towns quickly foul. Are they going to foul though? That's the question. Two possession game. Come the across the timeline. Fires the three. No good. And that'll do it. Thank you.
