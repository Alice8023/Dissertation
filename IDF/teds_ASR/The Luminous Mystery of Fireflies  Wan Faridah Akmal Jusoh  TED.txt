The life cycle of fireflies keeps the ecosystem balanced. Each firefly species in its indicative light stage has specific needs for a habitat to thrive. The act as bioindicator to ascertain whether a particular habitat is healthy or not. For example, in a mango forest, when you see a population of fireflies decreasing, that could be due to water quality degradation, which can be a sign of a collapsing food chain. Why? Because firefly larvae it snills. And snails need good water quality to thrive. In terrestrial habitats, firefly population declines can be attributed to light pollution. They are extremely sensitive to artificial light. Because this type of light can disorient, repel, or blind them. So, most of the time, when you see a decline in firefly population, you can bet other species that live in the same habitat that in which fireflies are found, are also declining. This is indicative of an unhealthy ecosystem. This is bad for us, humans do. It is a sign of overdevelopment that can induce climate effects such as flood and drought. As my delve deeper into the world of fireflies, I can't help but wonder the fascinating mysteries that are unfolded before me. It amused me to learn that some firefly species prefer to fly solo in forests, searching for light signals from their non-wing myths. While others choose together among streets where the ocean meets the land. Equally intriguing is the fact that some firefly species have larvae that dwell in slow moving rivers and ponds. While others have larvae that stay on land. I find it inspiring. I find it inspiring to know that there are so many undiscovered species hiding within them. Imagine how many more remarkable firefly species are waiting to be found. And I have always wanted to find them. But it can be hard. There are other dangerous animals too at night. On one occasion, when I was in a place called Lingi, I stopped at a tree with firefly colonies to collect a few specimens. When we turned on our headlamps, we saw row of red eyes. And soon we realised that we were surrounded by crocodiles. Sometimes, the discovery of new species can be prompted by examining collections in the Natural History Museum. In 2016, I went to Singapore and studied a firefly collection from Southeast Asia at Lee Kong Chan Natural History Museum. I saw a firefly specimen lying in the collection. That did not match any of the descriptions of the iron you are. There is no name attached to it. And nobody knew what it was. In fact, the first specimen of this unknown species was collected in 1989. That is a keen to a human adult living up to 30 years without name. And without a proper description of this person. So, my colleagues and I, in 2018, went on a mission. We coordinated the first night survey to the habitat of this unknown firefly, which happens to be the last remaining freshwater swarm in Singapore. We spent three hours exploring only to be greeted by the empty darkness. We went home disappointed and tired, not to mention dirty and smelly from the mud. We went in again three months later, still nothing. At this point, we thought, this is it. This species is gone for good. However, the third time, the charm. During the third time, visit to this swarm that we saw, a few tiny flashes start to show up and burst on turns. It was such an amazing feeling despite having to wait through the muddy, swampy waters and being fenced on by mosquitoes. The eagerness was still worth it. After two years of additional data collection and analysis, we confirmed that this unknown firefly species was new to science. It was also the first time since over a century that a new species of firefly, a luminous firefly from Singapore, was found. And so, we named it Lucilla Singaporea. There is a malaisei. It is only for the people to be able to understand if you are going to reach into the pickle jar, might as well put your whole army. The further I have gone into this work as researcher and educator in the field of biodiversity and conservation at Monash University Malaysia, the more passionate I have become. I have transformed from a curious girl wanting to know what clip, clip is to a driven scientist committed to safeguarding the fireflies of the world. The problem is that firefly habitats are fast, are disappearing fast. We are now in a race against time to name species before they disappear. I am a coach of the IUCN Firefly Specialist Group. But it is also my personal mission to collaborate, to work together with firefly lovers and stakeholders to identify and conserve threatened fireflies species everywhere. Here's a flash of hope. Join me on this journey, if you are keen. Fireflies need your help before they flash that one last time. Thank you.
