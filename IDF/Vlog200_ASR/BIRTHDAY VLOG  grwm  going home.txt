 Hey guys, it's Sid and welcome back to another vlog. Oh yeah! So, I realized, here's the thing. I really owe you guys an apology because the last video I posted was three weeks ago. Honestly, I'm slacking. I'm slacking. I'm slacking and I own up to it and it will never happen again. I've been really busy if you saw my last video, you know, I was kind of going through some stuff. But I'm back. I'm back now. I'm doing great. Thank you for your patience and understanding. This vlog is pretty usual kind of chaotic. I actually kind of start the vlog in LA, hanging out with my friends. Then I go home to Minnesota for a few days. Then I come back in the end of the vlog to celebrate my birthday in LA. You'll see as it unfolds. I love you guys and let's get started. Sorry, no, never doing that again. Guys, squad is here! Okay, so no one cares. Seb's literally came over and pulled out a thing of red and salami out of it. No, no, no, no, no. He's just funny because you pulled out of your backpack. Guys, have you ever meet Sydney in real life? No. Yeah. And if you ever meet Sydney in real life, she's... I'm living. Yes she is. I'm cutting that. You guys are mean. So I have to be an adult today. I do. I want to be classy. Okay, cheers. Guys, you know what's crazy? Me and Franne haven't been friends for four years. Franne, you are literally... I was gonna say this is a cloth camera. I feel like you are my older sister. Yeah, I think you've been through all phases of my life. Even if you look from the moment that you moved to LA, I just felt like I had to take care of you. Or make sure you were okay. You know what I mean? Franne's gonna give me some of my best life advice. I always have her best interest at hand. If anyone wants to... What the fuck did you... What the fuck with me? Good morning, Minneapolis. Hi, I'm Justin. My bestie, Justin is visiting me. I just want to say Massachusetts. Oh! This is Justin's first day here. We're in Minneapolis. We're kind of wanting to explore the city. Justin has the cutest fit on. I'm gonna show them. Show it to me. I'm gonna show it to you. Sure. Jeans. Some shoes. Ooh! Wait, I like the shoes. Yeah, they're so cool. I'm wearing this shirt that I just got from Princess Polly. It's really cute. It's like a corset. I'm wearing these jeans from Addicted. And Air Force ones. Nice camera show. It's so clear and the answers are so cute. Do you like that? I want to say pretty things. I don't know. Are they sorry? You are just noticing that now? Yeah. Let's clap. I'll show them. I got new nails. I wanted the French tip to be thin. I usually get a thick tip and I thought it'd be fun. I promise you press it. Oh my god. Why is it so loud? I swear I think that was person. Oh my god. We're taking a break. We're just walking around to Aigle's sleeves. We're taking a break. We're just walking around Aigle's sleeves. But we ended up at this coffee shop and it's actually really cute in here. We got some food and some lattes. This is like a caramel iced latte. I try to explain our humor to them. Me and Justin and Tumer will say something and try to imagine it happening. And it happens. It's just getting on the path. It never happens. Imagine if the worker started screaming at us to get out. Look at that. Get the f*** out of here, man. I forget that no one walks here because now everyone's looking at me. I forget that it's not as normal. But I don't care. We're in a dressing room trying some stuff on. I got this old corn-expert booth though. It says it's got very menisotin. I'm going to try on two things. One of them is this dress. I really like this. It's very Victorian. But I just don't know if it will fit me. We'll see. I like it. We look good. I like it with a collar too. It's so cute. Okay, I like it. I didn't like it at first. But I actually like this dress. It's really nice. I think it's fun. I'd have actually nothing like this. So. Oh. Nice. Woo! Okay, well. One time Justin went into my classroom in front of the whole class and told everyone I was a cheater. And then he left. I'm not a cheater. He just said that. He just said that. He just said that. Good morning vlog. I'm with my mom. No, no, no. I'm starting out the vlog. It's like 10 a.m. right now. I'm at my brother's basketball game. Yeah, Aston. Go! That's my brother. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! I'm so excited. I don't know. I'm about to see my best friend Rachel. I haven't seen her in, I think like, six months now. If you've watched me for a while, you wouldn't know Rachel. She's about to pick me up. I think we're going to go. Actually, I don't know what we're doing. I think we're getting food in them. We really love to like, penny board together. My outfit today is kind of random, but I'm wearing a grout fit. I'm wearing this little Calvin Klein bra. And these gray shorts that I got yesterday at the third store. They're actually from Princess Polly originally. And then my mom's zip-op jacket and my brother's hat. I'm with my bestie! Yay! And this is from last summer. We were trying to like, cut this with like, the plastic. Yeah. So we just ripped the plastic off so the plastic is literally still on it. Yeah. I think we're going to have to find it so broken. Yeah. Oh my god. Okay. Now we're going to have to find it. Okay. Now we're going to have to find it. Okay. Now we're going to have to find it. Asher's got out of work from Chick-fil-A. Look at him and his little fit. He was whipping up the ice cream. Wait, were you the one that made our lemonade? I don't know. I like, want to do and make it. That was like, why we don't. We just had fun. We just had family dinner. And now I'm being an audience member at a basketball game. And the basketball game is just my brother and my dad. Can I go? Okay. Good to be here for a couple days. Yeah. Okay guys. Okay. So basketball went wrong. So this is how the game ended. We just fell off the roof. That was genuinely actually very scary. So basketball game is done. That was so cool. It's so cool. It's so cool. It's so good. It's so good. We got it. Reading of a... That's really cool. He's a roll. Ashton, what answers you've been downed? Can I have another one, please? You already have fun. Oh yeah. You already have fun. Tonight is the night. I'm turning 22. I know I'm old now. Today's the third. It's not my actual birthday. But I'm having a little birthday dinner. It's my close friends tonight. I'm actually with Jake right now. Jake is sleeping though. I feel old. I really do. I don't know what it is about 22. But this year, this just sounds so much older to me. It don't have me. I was like, oh my gosh. I'm getting old now. I need to grow up and I need to start acting older. I always put so much pressure on myself, especially around my birthdays. Because I'm like, oh my gosh. Like, how am I doing? Am I accomplishing everything that I want to accomplish? You have to be gentle with yourself sometimes because I think it can just get really stressful. It might seem like everyone has their lives together, but they definitely don't. I haven't really been wearing foundation recently, but tonight I want to. So I'm wearing this tinted moisturizer by Rare Beauty. My makeup is done. Do you like it? It's so weird. You didn't even look at me when you said that. Anyways. I need to change. Really say something. I just... I just... But I wanted to say, happy birthday Sydney. We need a furry. I'm stressed out. I'm stressed. You're having a really good time. You're having a really good time. Go. Here we go. Freaking shot. Freaking shot. Freaking shot. Okay. Very anti-climatic. I'm feeling a party like that. Alright, give me that. They're dating. They're dating. Did you know that? They dated. You haven't dated my two years. Oh yeah. We've been dating. We have a rally for dinner. We're going to him in. Oh. Thanks, babe. This is the best. Just see the one. Sir, can. Say you'll find a boyfriend soon. Always. We're up for dinner. We need to have the whole eye. We need to have the whole rest of our kids. Yeah. I feel so happy. Thank you. So you're turning 22. You're turning 22, but there's not even 22 people. Why is nobody here? Like, we didn't even need a reservation. Like. Oh, my god. She looks like to my ear on fire. Yeah. Oh, it's okay. There you go. Sorry. I can do it. I can do it. I got scared. Oh, she said. But can you actually do it? No. It should be. No, it's okay. He's gonna push it on top. Oh, oh. Kick her. Ursun, baby. Oh, my god. Why? No, she's having a baby. Oh. She's having a baby. Oh. Oh, my god. How is this, honey? It's her. Oh, she's having a baby. Oh. She's having a baby. Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh, oh. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. What's that? There's a baby. Oh. Oh, yeah. This is not you. It's my birthday today. It's my actual birthday. I'm 22. I just woke up. I came out in my roommate, Maya. It surprised me with the cutest decor. She even got these little hills made and each one is little notes. And it's just so sweet because there's all of these little letters that I get to open. I can go through each one and look at all of our little memories and things that she had to say. And I just think it's so cute. This was like the sweetest thing to wake up to. I just didn't expect it at all. So thank you, Maya. I love you. It's currently actually noon, so it's kind of late. We actually just went to Starbucks and I'm with Jake, of course. What's up, everyone? Wait, let's not forget what went down yesterday. Yes, during me and Jake, for Ribert, they get extra into medieval times. The difference in our gifts. It's essentially like a jousting tournament. I just have never experienced it before and I was really honored to do so with my best friend. I'm going to quickly shower and then we actually have like kind of random stuff to do today. It's always kind of weird because my birthday's on the 4th of July. So everything's like closed and things are just different. But a few of my friends are like having pool parties. So I think we're going to try to go to a couple of them. Hey guys, so I'm out of 4th of July party. What is up YouTube? Welcome back. I would chase and chase. You know what I'm saying? What is going on guys? Another fucking video here. Guys, it's Cindy's birthday. Guys, today we're surprising her with Selena Gomez. She's actually out there right now, so let's go. We know everything's going to be a breeze. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. Are my parents a YouTuber? No! Me and Selena are about to win this game. I know. See, hot!
