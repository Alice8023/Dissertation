Pop the nubbys, it cleans it on my pores, new to Gina Boy And we meet again Gosh, I'm a very awkward person Hey guys, I'm so awkward This ends now, I think my most highly requested video recently Has been a skincare routine The last skincare routine I did was like three years ago It's actually like perfect timing because I have been so obsessed with skincare recently I just think it's so fun to try out new products I will just start off the bath by saying I have super super sensitive skin to all my girls or guys that are who also have sensitive skin, I feel you, I freaking break out from everything But these products, so I have a lot of skincare Seek not secret, so that sounds really like intense I have a lot of things that I do for my skin That I find really really help me And over the years I've learned what works best and what doesn't So I really hope this video helps you guys Hopefully you can take some tips, you know Take it or leave it, at the door I also want to mention it, thank you so much for your curiosity for sponsoring this video Quarantine glow up, here we come First step guys, well I feel like I'm your teacher in school Take notes First things first, I just need to say If I skip washing my face, either in the morning or night for one day It builds up so much extra oil And it really can break out my skin easily So I never skip a day I have a little bit of residue of makeup on So I'm going to wash that stuff off Shout out to the cat ears They never fail to make me look weird Oh, I messed up already, I forgot Before we wash our face We got to take off the makeup I'm using the Neutrogena makeup remover wipe I'm my boys, Neutrogena boy Sometimes for my eye makeup, especially mascara I need to use my cellar water to get it off Oh here it is I really like this Garnier Marcellar water One time I got a freaking chemical burn It was really awful, I felt like my face was on fire You know what, if you have sensitive skin, I feel you We're all in this together Also, I should mention I have freaked out myself Tanner Just ignore it, sorry Now it's time to wash our face As I said earlier, Acrology is sponsored in this video And I haven't used their products for a little over a month now I feel like my pores have just gotten so much smoother Now that I've washed my face, I will use a toner This toner from Pixie has literally been my go to product recently Basically this just really helps to shrink my pores And I just squirt it on it Oh my gosh, I way overshot that I just soak it with a cotton round And then I just apply it to my nose bridge And kind of just all over actually I just like to drag some of the excess Down to like my neck and neck let's say area So I like to just let this sit for two seconds I don't like to use stuff too quickly one on top of each other And I just like to let soak Gosh it's like tiring my arms man I will say one of my biggest face insecurities is my undrized circles I'm always looking for like new undrized creams and things This is one of it cosmetics most famous products And this is their buy-by undrized cream Can people leave the game? Yeah Hey, don't forget your skincare Also you should always use your wing finger When you're blending products in Cause it's the most delicate finger So Acrology has three steps to their skincare routine Obviously I already did the cleanser They have a specific formula that you get When you sign up for their program So this was actually designed just for me By my provider because she looked at my skincare quiz that I took And then whoever your provider is They'll make a custom formula And it's so awesome because it's literally unique to your skin I just love that they take it to account your specific skin needs Because everyone has different skin And they have different problem areas I personally have a lot of blackheads And just really bad pores I found that when I use this product It really helps to just even my skin tone I've definitely noticed that my skin is just a lot smoother Like the texture of it Which was my main concern And I get less blackheads when I use this Next up I'm going to using my moisturizer That Acrology sent me This is their rich moisturizer I've heard that you're supposed to blend products upward Because it prevents your skin from like wrinkling So guys we gotta think ahead Last up from a Nightly Skincare routine I'm going to be using a facial oil I feel like people debate whether you're supposed to use a facial moisturizer first Or the oil first I'd like to use the oil last So I have this Tarte Meracusia oil Gosh I hope I said that right I literally just take a couple of drops Because a little bit goes a long way with this stuff And then I'm afraid I have some honey oil up in my boil Oil is definitely not something that I always used I did actually realize later how beneficial it is Especially in the winter It just really gives you that extra bit of moisture for your skin You can also use like this oil on your cuticles Or like your elbows if they're really dry The stuff is so freaking moisturizing So a little bit goes a long way So those are the steps of my skincare routine at night Obviously some nights I'm busier than others So if I'm like super busy and I only have time for a quick little routine I always use my three curology products in a row Because those are just staples and I cannot go without them I do want to show you guys a few other products that I like though Just because I didn't show them my routine I still use them a lot throughout the day Or in the morning or something So first thing I want to show you guys Is this Kate Summerville Dermal Pwent Liquid Lift They actually gave this to me And this is the coolest thing It's basically a moisturizing spray So you can just see Could you even see that? I don't know It's just a really light product It helps some moisturize your skin But just provides in such a light way Another product that I really love Is the Kate Summerville Liquid Exfoliant I didn't exploit in today's video I tried to exploit like twice a week I don't want to go overboard But this is a really awesome gentle exfoliant As far as face masks go I have a few that I like to use My two favorites have been this Pixie Glow O2 Oxygen Amaz This is just a really lightweight face mask And it provides a little bit of moisture I also really love this glam glow mask So I actually got this for fun like a few months ago Because it's pink and it's so aesthetic Like look at that That's like freaking aesthetic I actually really like it Because it really tightens my skin after I use it Yeah it is actually It says it on here A firming treatment I really like this It's actually not only cute but effective As far as lip products At night I really like to use lip masks Or just something that's going to moisturize my lips So I forgot to show you guys But I'm going to use this awake lip therapy Lip mask If you can see that I'm just going to apply this to my lips Only 10 seconds I need 20 I will not lie This is a really thick product Like thick with 5C's I don't usually like to wear it during the day Because my hair will just like get stuck in it But it's really moisturizing at night So yeah that's pretty much my skincare routine That I wanted to share with you guys I guess the carriers come off now The time has come I will definitely like all the products that I used in this video In the description box I'll put a link in the description box to 4C If you want to try out their products And subscribe to their skincare It's super easy to get your first bottle Because you can actually get it for free And test it out and see how you like it You just have to pay it for $49 for shipping I really recommend it obviously I've been raving about their products this whole video But I do really love their stuff And I wouldn't be talking about their stuff If I didn't actually like it And I didn't see actual results If you are struggling with acne A lot of these products are really good at preventing breakouts Because I definitely have had my fair share of breakouts I mean anyone breaks out But these products definitely help to prevent it But yeah I hope this video was helpful for you guys This was super fun for me to make I love skincare I love you guys Thanks so much for watching I'll see you in my next video Bye guys
