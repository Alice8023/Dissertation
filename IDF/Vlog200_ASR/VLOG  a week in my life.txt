 Hey guys, it's Sid and welcome back. Hey! We're studying. It's one day. It looks like I just woke up. But I also kind of actually did just wake up. I'm going to be vlogging this week. Here's the thing. I find myself really sucking at vlogging like every day for a week. I can do one day or like a couple days but every day, usually I can't do that. So this is the challenge. Can I vlog every day, Monday through Friday? I don't know. I feel like I haven't done that since 2017. I'm starting the vlog going to grab some coffee with some of my friends from school. We have class in like an hour. Oh god. See, this is like why Mondays just know. I also didn't eat so I really hope that there's food here. I'm going to take my spot in one day. I'm with my friend Jesse. Now we're walking to school because parking sucks at school. We have class together, 11.30, research methods. Let's go. Okay guys, do I need my vlog? How do I get to do it? Yeah, that's what kind of question is that. Hey guys, swim. Class right now. Girl squad over here. Girl squad. Boy squad over there. Just me. We're in the back of the class right now. It's like a bus. But I don't want to keep on seeing the bus. Actually, I didn't think that. I didn't take the bus in the bus. What? You guys ever get kicked off the bus? No. Did you? I was like that, isn't it? Yeah. So I'm going to do my outfit today. Top is from Zara. Woo. We got shorts are from Zara. Woo. Shoes are from Princess Polly. Fit check. All right, yo. It is later. I realized as I was driving, I was looking actually in this mirror. And I was like, oh my gosh, my eyebrows are actually horrendous. So I thought, you know, before I go home, I should just get my eyebrows done. I also changed and my fashion is questionable right now for sure. I actually really like socks and sandals and I don't know why. My eyebrows are now done. I feel like a new person. Ta-da. I'm just so tired. I always reach this point at like 3 p.m. And I'm like, what do I do now? You know, like what might like, I have no one. I accidentally just hunked my horn. Anyways, my brows look so bright now. Guys, what do I do? Help me to do my homework. Okay, I'll do my homework. Thanks for telling me that. That. Hi. Hi. How was it? It was amazing. I'm so sleepy. Thank you. Thank you too. Checkfully never fails to save the day. Oh my god, that actually rhymed. Holy mackerel. Well, I didn't even plan to say that. I can just follow that. That was not planned and it did rhyme. I got my chick-play. I got the grilled sandwich and french fries. There's a reason every time I want to go to a chick-play, it is always a Sunday. Baaaay. Hiya. Hiya, Marie. Oh my god, you're chick-play. Hmmmm. Yeah. Good morning. It's now Tuesday. And I'm going to go back to the bathroom. Okay. I'm going to go back to the bathroom. Okay. Now, Tuesday and I have a meeting at 10 a.m. baby. Let's go. And that's in one minute, so I should get on it. Hi, Sophie. How are you? Hi guys. I'm good. How are you? Hi. Good. We're walking in class about 10 minutes. The solo cup in electrolyte. This probably looks concerning for school. It's definitely giving off some type of vibe. So I have a smoothie in this cup because I didn't want to bring like that. It's a car to a cup. So I had to bring a reusable one. It's not alcohol. That's what she's telling us. Hi, Katie. Hello. Guys, we're studying. Are we going to... We'll try. Honestly, no. It's later in the day. I've just sucked it long today. I was at so aggressive. I just have, like, I'm so bad at it. So I rallied myself. And I rallied myself to go to In-N-Out. I also, like, am I unironically matching In-N-Out right now, I feel like? It's now. Actually, it's like pretty late. It's 8 a.m. I'm actually going to a late night. I'm with Jessie. I'm wearing this little black dress. It's necklaces, earring, and Jessie, you want some of your outfit, actually? Sure. I'm wearing this safe-looking dress. Oh, and... And... Okay. And jacket. Ooh, and your boots. And for more to wrap. I'm the boots are my favorite part. I've been wanting boots like that. Good. I'm so happy. I'm like, where's the whole truck? Good morning. Good morning. I'm back. Yes, I did forget to vlog. For two weeks. I did kind of predict this to happen. But that's something I'm going to vlog for two extra days. Or maybe I won't. I don't know. Today's Friday. I have class in like an hour. But I've been really wanting to make my roommates breakfast. So my mom actually sent me like a waffle maker. Oh, I think I actually like unbox it. I think I'm a vlogger. I was like, oh my gosh, I shouldn't make these for my roommates. And I keep forgetting to do it. So this is the morning. I'm going to make it for them. And then I'm going to make it for them. I'm going to make it for them. Look how cute. It's so adorable. I just realized I have a test today. I shouldn't be studying for it. So I was doing this. Oh. No shell, baby. Let's go. Oh, it looks so good. Oh my gosh, I totally thought it wasn't going to be like this. I am like shocked it looks like this. I was just pretty good. I actually like testing it. I didn't want it to be like disgusting. Okay, guys, the breakfast is done. They're actually like not bad either. But my roommates are sleeping right now. Well, two of the five. Flash forward. Is that the word? Speed up? I don't know. It's like five hours later. I had one class after I made breakfast. That one was well. Somehow, aced my test. I really expected like to get 50%. Anyways, boss besides the point. I'm getting ready really quickly to go to my friend. Nias for the weekend. Someone else spent weekend with her in a way. I'm really excited. Let's go. Can we just take a second to appreciate that it's Friday? Even though by the time you're watching this, it's probably not Friday. So I'm gonna quickly just pack and overnight bag because I kind of need just like a few things. I'll show you guys what I pack for a life. Because I go there all the time. I pretty much have my bag done at this point. Like the things that I put in there. Essentials, clock lip for sure, car mix. Although I've heard this is like actually not good for your lips, but I still use it. A hair binder. If you call them my hair tie, do not associate with me. Sorry. I don't actually kind of want to call for. It's a little rude. The thing is, is like I don't want to try this weekend. Because I'm tired, but I probably should. I recently got this dress from Princess Pauline, which I really like. Maybe I'll pack that. I probably should bring my retainer, but I'm not. I didn't need my glasses. Because recently, my vision has been significantly getting worse. Makeup big. Makeup remover wipes. Flap top. Which every time I ever talk about my laptop on here, I'm like, I need to get the stickers off, or you're still on here. It's just too much, you know. I hope that's everything. Toothbrush. And rough. Thank you. Bye guys. Have fun this weekend. I just had to buy you a new one. Okay guys, I'm now at dinner with... Me. We got our food. You got... It looks so nice. I got a curry. It's curry. Oh, it looks so good. I got a margarita pizza. It also looks good. This place is so cute. We stand. We stand. And the bathrooms. And the bathrooms are super nice. The bathroom might win in there, and I texted me. I'm like, this bathroom is literally so cool. I'm kind of tired to tell you. Okay guys, we just had dinner. Now we're getting cookie dough to make at home. We're gonna watch a movie. Ooh, should we do like mini? That's fun. They taste better to me. Like, I don't know if it's... Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's so funny. Okay guys, we are home now. We're making the cookies. Making the cookies, girl. It is girls' night. It is girls' night. It is girls' night. Jin, it's girls' night.

Well, that's not true, actually. You're literally not sure. Yes. Don't make people feel bad for you. Don't feel bad for him. He's literally not invited. Don't feel bad for him. Oh, take, don't feel bad for him. Oh, take, don't feel bad for Dave. Hey guys, we're going to San Francisco. Yeah guys, we're going to San Francisco. That's why. Well, we're all in the size of. We're trying to book a location. I'm literally fine with anything. Actually, actually, I'm not in the size of it. Maybe it's Jake that's in the size of it. Honestly, I'm so decisive. Literally, you're not in the size of it. You're literally not in the size of it. You're literally not in the size of it. I said it was a person, it'd be me. That's literally just not true. Yeah, I'm sorry to tell you but no. Right, you're fun. Good morning. It's the next morning. I got up kind of late, like 11am, showered. Still haven't really gotten ready. I also realized I didn't pack. Hardly any outfits. So, that's an issue. I'm actually wearing literally the same thing. Don't judge me. Actually, not home right now. She's at a voice lesson. I've just been getting ready. I showered. That's actually all I've done. Do you guys want to see what I had for breakfast this morning? This. This was my breakfast. They're so good. Like the menu ones just taste better and I will never not say that. We went to Urban Outfitters and there was like a, this store kind of just has all of, I don't want to say the rejects either. Basically, it's just like extra stuff that didn't sell. Yeah, I guess. I don't know. Basically. Okay, so we both got the same shirt. I actually saw in the, I have this first. Well, I saw it and I was like, dude, you have to get this shirt. They have one in your size. So, I love it. So, we both got the same shirt. It's from, it's each friends, Ite's friends, whatever it's hot. Have you pronounced it? And then I got this cute little stretch shirt. I love that. This is literally, okay, so this is a thrifted item actually. So, like, they said. It's like half and half. It's like half and half. It's like, really fun. Really fun. Oh, we got the same dress. So, I found this black dress. This shirt. Yeah, it came up to me and she's like, half to like try this dress on. Yeah, because I loved it, but I was like, you don't have my size, but it's in your size. So, it's like, you need to try it on. I love it because it has like the cutouts on the sides. It looks like really flattering. And it's like a body contour, so it's super tight. But it's like, very good quality. It's good quality, it's nice. And then I got the same one. I got the same thing just in white, because I had it in my size. So, we're gonna be 20 again. Yeah, photo, photo. Every time. Did you tell you we're going to Sam Fran? So, it's like this, and it matches my pants. I think it's just so cute. Like, oh, it's so oversized. And, it matches my pants with match jeans. Like, I just, I love it. That's the end of the atshaul. I only have one more thing. I got this green like flannel. I love it. I showed you this. You did it. It's cropped in a hat. It's like frayed at the ends. And I feel like this is just again, perfect for fall. And it like fits me, really good. It's so soft and comfortable. And there we go. That's our haul. Y'all. That's our fall haul, y'all.
