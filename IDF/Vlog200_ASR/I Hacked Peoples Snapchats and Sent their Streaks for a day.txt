 Hey guys, what's up? It's Sid. So I'm a brand new on. I got sliced thriller about my faucet. I am going to be a hacker today. That's so terrible. Oh my gosh. I went on TikTok half an hour ago and I posted a video asking for people to DM me on Instagram. They're Snapchat username and password. And I got so many passwords and I didn't know how to choose. So I'm so sorry if I didn't choose yours. I decided to choose five random people to hack. Gosh, it doesn't get any better. It just sounds terrible. The thing is, is that I have permission from these people to go on their Snapchat. Basically I'm just going to log into their Snapchat's and I'm going to post it on their story. I'm going to Snapchat their friends. They know I'm filming YouTube video and everything. So they said it's all good with them. I'm starting out with a girl named Nora. This feels so like not right. I feel like guilty doing this, you know? It just like, I feel like I'm invading someone's privacy. You know what? I'm just going to Snapchat everyone on her friends list. I said sub-bro. I'm going to save it to her memories. Can't be excuse me to all of her best friends. Maybe I'll post on her story. But I showed them on the first place. I'm about at this. I'm going to keep it nice and simple and just say, hi, post. Okay, I posted to her story, Avery, Omji. Omji what? Alexa sent us a chat. What? What do you mean what? Like the green hair, bit moji. Who is this? Um, what do I say? Selena Gomez. Huh? What? This isn't Nora. Who's that? I'm confused. You're on Nora's snap. Wait, I am? Oh shoot, my bad. Okay, we got another Snapchat from Avery. I'm dying. I was just watching your YouTube videos. Oh, that's so funny. Okay, Alexa is still really confused. She doesn't know what's going on. No, actually, Nora stopped. You sent me a picture of Sydney Serena. I'm going to use Selena Gomez. Nice one. Is this for YouTube? This isn't Nora Doe. The fact that I just said Doe. Sorry. Send another pic. Okay, she's like not convinced. Okay, here you go. Okay, Alexa sent another chat. Is this Sydney Serena? I don't know if I should believe this or not. She doesn't believe me. It is. I pinky promise. Okay, I'm gonna video chat her. Hi. Hi. I've never done this before, but I just wanna tell you that it's actually me. Oh my gosh, I was still confused. What did you think? Did you think that your friend was just sending the pictures of me? Yeah, I thought she'd like found a picture of you and just like put high and put out her story. No, I'm just hacking your snapchat. So next up, we're gonna be doing Paisley. By the way, that is the cutest name ever. I love that name. All right, here we go. Whoa, okay, she has a lot of streaks. Whoa, there's so many. Oh my. Honestly, respect. I think Paisley has at least 100 streaks, if not more. That takes commitment. I could never do that. All right, let's start out by posting on the story. And I feel like I should switch it up a little. So I'm gonna do a self-timer photo. Ah, dang it. Okay, I think I'm just gonna sit down. Okay, yes, this is good. Hey, how's it going? She changed it so the star means streaks. She told me so I'm gonna send it to every single person that has a star. My finger is getting tired. Not actually, but like it kind of feels like it. Okay, here we go. That was a lot of work, man. Please, someone has to open this within. Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, two replies. Well, we're on fire today. Nick replied. Oh, that was like boring. Okay, here's to him, let's see what she said. Hey, I'm Paisley's best friend. Oh, hey girl, what's up? Noah, great, what about you? Honestly, doing amazing. Thanks for asking, but okay, Ethan, weird? That's my response to that. Jenna, dang, we have a lot of replies today. WTC, what does that mean? What the crap? That's probably definitely not what it means. Okay, we got something from this guy named Tucker. Whoa. I don't know what to say. I'm just gonna say my same classic line. They call me Fubri's, cause I'm so fresh. They're just imagining me sending these things to people I know and how weird it would be. It's a daryon. Good question mark. Glad to hear that. Nothing really, what's your snap? I'll add you. SydneySferena.p, add me. Noah, LOL, who are you? Dude, I'm your cousin. You forgot about me? Tucker got back to us, what do you say? And he's the one that I said the Fubri's so fresh thing too. F are you, Elimeo? My name is Vanessa Hudgens. You may have seen me on high school musical. I feel like I'm really making new friends in this video. What's trans again? I'm going to take over Emma's Snapchat right now. I'm hoping this will go well. She has a lot of people that she's Snapchat's so that's a good thing. What should I send? I'm gonna do a timer camera thing. Whoa. Crazy seeing you here. Okay, I'm gonna send this to every freaking streak she has. Guys, I don't mess around. Someone has to reply. Okay, NateD says. Oh, that's it. Okay. Guys, what, these people are not saying anything. They're just like studying pictures of their face. Kaitlyn C. No way, Omji, hi, I love you. Hi, Kaitlyn. Avery. Omji. Omji, hi. NateD again. And I don't understand how they're not confused. Here, I'm gonna send something really weird. Enjoying some coffee on this lovely Monday afternoon. How about you? Avery. Omji, hi, you're so pretty. This is crazy. Omji, you're so pretty. Bryce Dean took a screenshot of my Snapchat and then Snapchat at me. So let's see what they have to say. Hey, sup. Just watching the grass grow. How about you? Okay, NateD says. Just chillin'. Okay, the shoe flex. We love to see it. Nice shoe. Gracias. No prop, Nate. Bryce Dean. Eating waffles and orange juice. She texts like the same way I text. And like, these are like the types of pictures I send. The angle is priceless. Girl, you passed the vibe check. We have some new Snapchaters coming in. Tyler Kay says. Oh, okay. Kay. NateD, I'm just gonna be blunt, you know? What's the line my say? Don't you think it's weird? I'm logged into your friend's Snapchat? NateD got back. He is fast, he is speedy, and he passes the vibe check. He said, I was so confused until I looked you up. Wait, like what? I'm confused. Bryce Dean. Dog says hi. Wow, honestly, I vibe with this girl. Like, I've said this once and I'll say it again. She passes the vibe check. Like, she's just so fun and funny. Omg, I love your dog. I say hi. Ben. Okay, we actually just got our first Snapchat text from Emon. I don't know how to say it. Who's that? Who are you? Wait, hold up. That made no sense, I don't know why I said that. So, like, you come here often. She was pretty on, I'm not gonna lie. Who? There, I just had him a picture of me so then he knows like I'm still on the Snapchat. Oh, I don't think I've had a more awkward combo than this. I like dogs. Okay. NateD. Yeah, about to subscribe. Oh my gosh, NateD, I told him I'm on YouTube channel and he said he's gonna subscribe. Omg, thank you, Nate. Obviously, I feel like me and Nate are friends now. Ooh, we got a Snapchat from Avery. Whoa, what? Whoa, hi. Guys, Emon is typing again. What did he say, I need to see. Same. Glad we are on the same page. I like the Steelers. Oh, that's where you lost me. I like the Vikings, even though they lose a lot. Avery says, OMG, I literally love you. Oh, OMG, I love you. Bryce Dean sent me a pic of her dog. Thanks for the photo. I'm going to frame it. We just got a chat from Matthew. Question mark. I'm gonna send the upside down question mark. What are you doing? Eating Oreos. How about you? It said your screen recording. Screen recording? That's strange. There, I just sent him a photo of myself. Again. Oh, oh, God. Oh, oh, go on, right seriously. Oh my gosh, I'm so bad, guys. I feel so bad. Bro, I feel terrible. I screwed up. I am so sorry, Emma. Matthew, I think unadded you. I'm so sorry, Matthew and Emma. For ruining this Snapchat relationship, I mean, you guys didn't even have a streak, actually. I just realized, but I would say overall, it was very fun. Thank you so much to all the girls who sent me their Snapchat info and let me log in. It was so much fun and it was something very different that I haven't done before. My camera's on to route storage. So, love you guys. Thanks for watching and I'll see you in my next video. Bye, guys.
