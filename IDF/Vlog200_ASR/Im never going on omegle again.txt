 Hello everybody. I'm just gonna start by saying I'm very sorry. I know I've been the worst YouTuber and I didn't post for like two weeks and I could list a multitude of reasons of why that is how that happened but I know no one really cares so I thought the only way to appropriately make up for my and excusable YouTube behavior would be to go on Omega. If you watched me a couple years ago you might remember that I used to go on Omega concerningly frequently. They were like some of my favorite videos to make. I think they're so funny because Omega is such a weird sight and I feel like I almost like play this character when I'm on there like because you have to be kind of weird so I thought it would only be right to revisit my Omega days if you guys be prepared because this video this it's a lot Omega is a weird place. What have you been up to today? What's your name? My name is AJ. What about yours? Sydney. Nice to meet you Sydney. Nice to meet you. Tell me like a fun fact about yourself. That's it AJ? Yeah.
