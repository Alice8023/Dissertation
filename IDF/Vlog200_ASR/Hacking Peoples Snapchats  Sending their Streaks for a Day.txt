 Hey guys, it's Sidd. I'm gonna be a hacker again today. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ A few months ago I did a video where I hacked some of your guys' snapshots. And by hacked, I mean, like, hacked with consent. Basically, I just sent your guys' streaks for you, kind of took over your snapshots. And ever since that video, I get a lot of DMs asking me to do it again. So I went on my Instagram and I basically asked you guys to send me your Snapchat information if you wanted me to hack you. So I picked a few of your guys' snapshots and I'm gonna hack them. It doesn't give better. It really doesn't. All right, first off, we're starting out with this guy named Zach. You know what's really awkward? Like, I hope I remember my Snapchat password because I'm about to log out. Well, we can only hope how many streaks is this man have? And why did he leave them all on open? Ooh! I suck at Snapchat, so this is impressive to me. I'm just gonna send a picture of myself. Sup. Why is this group chat named Feed Addiction? I'm not gonna ask. Okay, I just sent it. Oh, shh, I just went to a chat and I was screen recording. Shamika, soyares. First one to reply. Wait, stop. Stop what? Damn, Amanda really left me on open. All right, Shamika, who are you? Okay, looks like she's in class. Wait, who are you? Well, in the meantime, I'll save some stuff to his memories. Hi, Zach. Yo, no one's responding. I'm over it. I'm gonna send another one and I'm gonna make it really, really strange so that way people will be intrigued. When all else fails, you gotta do time or camp. This is not funny to anyone else but me, but... I'm only putting it on for three seconds. People can't look at this for too long. Catching up on some sleep. How about you? Corbin opened it and he replayed it. You know what that means. Corbin, I am confused. What do you mean you're confused? Don't you remember me? I am very confused. We know you're confused, Corbin. Oh, we got a video. We got a video. This is fun. The addiction sent something that weird like room chat name. What is this? What is this? Everything makes sense. Our feet picks. Ew! Ew! I hate this group chat. It's a big no for me, but also I feel like I got a contribute. Well, hopefully they enjoy that. I'm hungry. Oh, feet addiction snapped back. I hate this group chat. Ew, this is so disturbing. I'm literally just sending a picture of myself at this point. I'm disturbed. Ew. Okay, I think my hands are ready. Back to business. Ooh, we got some snapchettes. Feed addiction. We got to open that first. Why? What do you mean why? It's just weird to have a group chat called my feet addiction. I'd suggest a new addiction. Only a few things gross me out in life. Actually a lot of things to do, but this is definitely top tier of what makes me cringe. Kind of scarring, honestly, but find another passion in life. It's a joke. Ew! Well, obviously it's a joke. I knew it was a joke. You're hot, though. Well, you know what? I think I'm done here. My work here is done. Thank you, Zach, for letting me log in. I had fun. Your friends were kind of strange, honestly. The feet group chat is what got me, but maybe I just don't get it. You know, maybe I'm the problem. Okay, so we're going to be moving on. Next up, I'm doing this girl named Celeste Instagram streaks. I'm going to say some things to her memories just for fun. Hi. Let me send something to all of her streaks. Oh my gosh, Raymond. What did he say? Yo Celeste, yo Raymond, what the fuck? You screen record for no reason. Screen record? You're the one screen recording. I feel bad. What if this is a- What's going on? Sup, Raymond, what's up? Dude, you're screen recording everything, bro. Raymond, what's with you today? Are you, you have a little attitude today? What's up? What did you put up to? Me? Yeah. Do you miss me? No. Oh. We haven't talked about it in a minute. We talked all the time though. We're in Spanish class together. What? Oh wait, we're on class. What are you screen recording six times? What the fuck? You want to expose me? I'm not going to expose you. I'm tired. Okay, anyways, you want to play a game of a mom-ass or something? I don't play that. Well, that's a no from me then. It was nice talking with you. Dude, you're so- You're not Celeste. You're not Celeste. It's not nothing like her. What are you talking about? You're not per- I am getting over a cold, like, honestly. What the bro, you hadn't even seen me today. You didn't even text me today, like, what? Dude, I- because I'm getting over a cold, so I've been, like, a little MIA. I'm just trying to reach out now. Hold on. Hold on, I'm coming. Oh. How are you? You really thought I was Celeste? That's a big game, maybe a little bit. You definitely did it at the beginning. Show me her. I'm not with her. I'm literally not with her. How you get it? I'm a YouTuber and I took over her snapshot. I never met Celeste in my life. This is my apartment. I've never said it to. I can't process right now. I can't process this right now. What's- what's- what's with the attitude? What's the attitude? You don't have an attitude. I just think it's funny to say that. I definitely don't. And you definitely don't. You're honestly chill. Like, I kind of vibe with you. Thank you. You too. Thanks, Raymond. We should be friends. We should. Show me a condo window. Okay, Crub. Okay, it's not a crib. It's an apartment unit, but you can't really see, but- My mind is- You know what, Raymond? It's okay. Like, you don't need to understand everything. Like, all that matters is that we're friends now, you know? I'm Sydney. Hi, Sydney. You're a YouTuber. Sydney, Serena. Hi, sorry. S-Y-D-N-E-Y-S-E-R-E-N-A. I don't know. I just talked to that. 2525 Sydney Serena. What the f- That's not you, man. Why are you on her account though? Like, it's a random. So many questions, Raymond. Nice. Nice. Have a good night. Thank you. You too. I think Raymond is my favorite person. I've ever met doing a Snapchat takeover video. I feel like she handled it how I would handle it. I'm- would be very confused.
