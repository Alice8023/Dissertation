 Hey guys, what's up? It's Sid. Today, as you can already tell by the title, I am going to be a prank calling fans. So basically what I did is I DMed this girl named Kayla. She has a fan page for me. She's like so so sweet. I basically asked her if she could somehow get the phone numbers of other people in the fandom that have fan pages. Somehow she fnest and she got the numbers. Obviously she shouldn't say what it was for. I think she tried to make it like super casual and chill so they wouldn't know. A text now subscriber you are trying to reach is not available. Hi guys. As you could tell yesterday was just the biggest fail ever. I got some more phone numbers. Okay, this cannot be a flop. Hello, this is Lucy from KXFM. I'm here to tell you that you want you want two tickets to the Taylor Swift concert. This is Lucy with KXFM. No, no, no. I just got rejected. I'm calling back. I'm offended. Hi, I'm here to tell you you want two tickets to the Taylor Swift concert. Would you like to claim your prize? Oh, I'm sorry. I don't want to. Why? Why not? Best of both worlds. She's like not having it. I promise I won't call you again. This is Sydney, Serena. This is Sydney's Serena. I was frank on you. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. I love you so much.

So you're my video. What did you think? Did you think it was like legit at all? I thought it was fake. What do I do that like can make me more believable? I'm having trouble. Maybe look. This is your pizza delivery. I'll tie that next. You reached zero four. Hi. I have your order for Domino's pizza, the extra large pepperoni pizza ready for you. Um sorry. You don't order pizza. This is Brooklyn, right? No. Oh, who is this? Isabella? Isabella. Oh, I'm sorry. We must have got the wrong pizza. We're at your doorstep. Go ahead, you're not telling me this is. My name is Jasmine. No, it's not. We don't even know your whole sister number. Domino's little, no, it has a sister number. Oh, I just like being mysterious. I can find out who's putting numbers. How? Oh, my dad's gonna take this. Oh, well so am I. I do some detective work on the side, but I also make pizzas. I just can't just tell you one thing. What? Why? I'm stupid. I'm stupid? Why? Why? You know, it's who? Who is it? Do you know who I really am? Jasmine? I'm not Jasmine. I'm Sydney Serena. Yeah, my promise. I promise. I'm doing a video for my YouTube channel, prank-calling fans. I got your number. I'm not actually Jasmine. I don't have pizza and I'm not at your door. I'm not at your door. I'm not at your door. I'm not at your door. Oh, really? Oh, wow. Plotswist. Yeah, not your cousin. Oh, it's not me. Hi. I'm sorry that I went off on you. It's okay. Is your dad really a detective? No, yeah, he is. But I think it was like my friend from school and I'm like, why are you calling him? I love you. I love you too. Thanks for supporting me. Yes, Mama. Okay, two people have answered so far. Cachang, but we still have work to do. Hi, I was saying this is... I didn't even get to say one word and I was just decline. Do I call back again? Yes. Hi, I'm Liger message for 30,000. Hi, hi, is this Amber? You know. Oh, is Amber there? No. Oh, okay, because I was Gretchen and I was told this was Amber's number. I was trying to get in contact with her. Right. What's your name? Georgina. Georgina. Oh, it's a pretty name. Okay, yeah, definitely not the right number. What's up? Nothing? Yeah, same. I've been really my little... So, who is this? My name is Fleece because I was Gretchen. Because I was Gretchen. Right. I was just curious. Um, yeah, because I thought you were my friend who went to my elementary school and I was just... No. No. I'm sorry, I'm sick. I was just trying to reconnect. Yeah, I'm dizzy right now. Okay, wait, can I actually tell you something though? Like an actually relevant... Is that a yes? Yes, yes, sure. Um, do you have a fan page for like anyone on Instagram? Um, yeah. For who? It's um, since Marina, why? Who is that? In YouTuber that I read watch, I'm gonna get a page. Why? Um, well is she like, does she do cool videos? Should I watch her videos? You can't, I've not. You know, she kind of sounds sketched to me, but maybe I'll check them out. Right. I'm sorry, this has been me. Um, do you pay a whole video? So yeah. Oh my god. Hi. Hi. You totally sounded so different. Now, you were like somebody from my school and just like, wait, how did I know I have a fan page? I didn't know who it was, so I got really scared for a minute and I'm like, how did I find my number? Hi. Hi, this is Janine. Hi, this is Janine calling from KXFM. You want two tickets to the Taylor Swift concert. Hi? Hi, yeah, would you, do you want the tickets? Otherwise, we can always transfer them to another, um, participant. If you, if you want, if you want the tickets, what? Is this Sydney? Yeah, this is Sydney. How'd you know it wasn't me? How much money? Oh, don't cry. I can make your phone. I can't make your phone. I'm sorry, that was a terrible prank call. I totally failed. Hello? Hi, is this Amelia? I know, this is Chloe. Oh, I think I have the wrong number. Okay, sorry, I was looking for you. Wait, is this Sydney? Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. Who's Sydney? I'm just Sydney Serena. Who's that? Wait, my friend messaged me saying that Sydney Serena called her and I was just wondering because a girl asked for my number. Oh, I don't know who that is. I'm, my name is Amelia and I live in Texas so I was just looking for my friend. I recognize this voice, the season, oh I, what is that supposed to mean? I, I recognize this voice like a lot. Well, that's really odd. Are you? Wait, hello? Bojo? This is Sydney, this has to be Sydney though. I'm just confused because I don't know who that is. Like, I'm just trying to find my friend and I thought this was her number. I think she gave me the wrong number. I'm confused. Yeah, I'm kind of confused too. So, you know, but you know, it's also like so confusing. What? I'm confused because one time someone told me in this world you either crank that soldier boy or it cranks you. Oh my god, oh my god, where is this Sydney? This has to be Sydney. Oh my god. Yeah, it's me. Hi. You really knew it was me right away, didn't you? Yeah, because I can recognize this voice because I want enough videos of yours to know what your voice sounds like. Oh my god. Then it, oh my god, like, shaking. Honestly, this video was a lot harder than I anticipated it would be. Just because I think I was able to gather a total of like 30 numbers and only like four or five picked up. I did want to give a really big thank you to Brianna, Kaila, and April for helping me to get people's numbers. But I just wanted to say thank you so much to anyone that has a fan page for me. I think that's so incredible. That someone has a fan page for me like I can't even fathom that. When I was in middle school, I had a fan page for Bethany Moda. Just thinking that some people do that for me. It blows my mind. I just wanted to say thank you whether I talk to you today or not. I love you and I really appreciate you. So thank you so much and I hope you guys know that. I love you from the bottom of my heart. But thank you guys for watching. I love you and I'll see you in my next video. Bye guys.
