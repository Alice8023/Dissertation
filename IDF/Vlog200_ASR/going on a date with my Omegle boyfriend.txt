 Wow, I have a lot of explaining to do. Hello everyone. So, if you watched my video a couple weeks ago of me trying to find a boyfriend on Omega, you may or may not recognize Aubrey. Hello. How old are you? 20. 20? Are we dating or not? Are we? I'm asking you. Yes. Oh. So, Aubrey and I hit it off, you know, and I think Aubrey is the one for me. Out of every boy in that video, Aubrey and I just connected the most. I think because we also saw each other twice on Omega. It just felt like fate. Basically, Aubrey and I are getting married. And you're invited to the wedding. Aubrey and I have been staying in touch. He is the best. And we thought it would be super funny to film a video of us going on a little date. Guys, wish me luck. Oh my gosh, he's late. He's late. Hi. Hello. You dressed nice. Wicked. I bought this shirt today. You did? Yes I did. Really? That's so nice. Woo. Try it here. Okay, this is a little chaotic. And I don't even think we're going to. This is our date. It's so romantic. Alright. Okay, so. Wait, you just need to see your face. You're going to have your date pen on our date. It's in states. It's in states. I'm really worried. Let me just introduce you though. I feel like I should introduce you. Guys, this is Aubrey. Hi. I'm Aubrey. I'm Aubrey. I'm Aubrey. I'm Aubrey. I'm Aubrey. I'm Aubrey. I'm Aubrey. Hi. You may recognize him from my Omega video. Aubrey. Oh my god. Oh my god. Sorry. I'm going to intro. Everyone's intro. I'm going to intro. What the f*** are you guys telling you this? Tell them about yourself a little bit because they're probably confused like where you are. I'm 19. I'm a United States Marine. Currently in Missouri. So you know what? Usually for states it's just like the two of us. But you have your wing men with you. Yes, I have five wing men with me. Who's the waiter? I mean, he was going to get dressed up with the codas. It's a very chaotic day. They're ruining the mood. This is supposed to be romantic. Okay, so the influencer is the waiter. He's getting dressed right now. What restaurant are we at? Monkeys. Chicken. I'm excited. What's on the menu? Chicken dinners. Just chicken dinners. This is all they have. So how was your day? Pretty good. I've been getting ready for this all day. Oh, I've been preparing, getting super good. All the preparations, everything that needs to happen. Make this a very successful day for us. Thanks, Aubrey. Where's our waiter? This is like very bad service. Yeah, the service is terrible. I'm sorry. You're chicken, sir. Yo, where's my food? Oh, shit. I'm so mean. Do you have a menu or something? Like, you're selling, man. We didn't even get to order it, really. But like... They just knew what we wanted. I changed my mind about this restaurant. Yeah, maybe the service is pretty good. When did you start doing YouTube? I started doing YouTube six years ago. And why do you start? I don't know. I started for fun. And then you blew up, huh? When did you have your blow up when you started doing it? I used to do these very cringy prank videos. Are they still up? Why? I can watch this. Aubrey, I really love this shirt. I can't believe you got it just for this date. I respect that. I thought it was a very nice shirt, and I thought you would like it. Aubrey, do you want to explain the story of the screensaver? So... Guys, Aubrey did that for me. He put me as his log screen. Guys, Aubrey showed me how FaceTime was. He was friends show me. It was like the sweetest thing ever. So then I was like, for the same... In preparation for this date, I have to do the same. It's only fair. So this is my screen saver. So, Aubrey is what's the term, ropper? Yeah, I used to ropper. So I got this from his Instagram. I respected Aubrey. I didn't have many videos to choose from. You're answer, I'm very limited. How's your style? Why are we getting paparazzi? What was your first impression of me on a Michael? I was a very caught up guy whenever you said you look at people with boyfriend. They say, oh, Michael's the place for love and look where we are now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. They say, oh, Michael's the place for love and look where we are now. I see. Are you gonna eat that? Yeah. My first impression of you was, well, you were wearing those sunglasses and I was kind of like, when someone's wearing sunglasses during the day, that's just already sketchy. So I was like, you know, I had to like give you a chance. And then you were super cool. Here we are now, this is my recipe. This date has to happen. Are we on the date, too? If you want. Yeah, he's on the date, too. He's on the table behind us. Yes. I was going to die in the back. Watch what you do. Oh, this is painful. This is the worst for a day I've ever been on. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My friends are putting in on their conversation. He's very busy with my streets. You have a lot of girls hitting you up? Holy, holy, no. No, holy friends, of course. I only have one on me, real friends. I don't know if I believe that, but... A good relationship is always built on trust. I would have trusted you if you were on time. You were also late to send me the link. So whatever, he was close with the schedule. I'm trying to go on a date with the girl. If you are failing this, you're... Okay, to create conversation, ask quite a bit. Say a joke. What's like a day in your life? For us, during the week, we'll get up at like 3.30, have to be outside by 4. And then we go to the 6 mile run, like we go down a hill. And then we go down the hill. Can you shut up? I'm sorry. You're so weirdly interruptive. No, this is like good. I enjoy this drama. Do your friends support our relationship? You have one though. You're very aggressively eating that stuff. So, Aubrey, what do you look for a new girl? A good personality. Somebody who's funny, you have to be funny. Like, if you're bland, I can't vibe with you. Agreed. Or someone who's beautiful, but beautiful, not always. Beauty is on the outside for you and on the inside. Oh, thanks, Aubrey. This is so forced. You can relax. Oh, well, I'm not trying to be tense. Okay, where are you from? You know this. I'm from Minnesota. What do you look for a new guy? Tressworthy, funny, good sense of humor. You know, you gotta vibe with the person and have fun. Someone who's hardworking, but also humble. I hate entitlement. That's like my least favorite characteristic. I'm pretty smart working. I mean that one for sure. I'm a poor guy, right? Oh, this. I wish we were alone. Aubrey, what's your ideal first date? Like, if we could go on a real day right now, what would you do for me? I know exactly what I would do. Have you ever been to a drive-in movie? Yes. It's perfect in the back of a truck with like a mattress that, or like an air mattress, in a bunch of, that's a terrible first date. Shut up. Shut up! You know what's funny? On my Pinterest, pins of like, I've like a board of like date stuff. That is like one of the pins. Really? So what's your ideal first date? I think something similar. I feel like the only downside to the drive-in is that you can't talk to the person. So I feel like the back of a truck, like very cute. I would say like, watching the sunset. That's all like a pretty good date. Yeah. Maybe some Netflix too. Netflix? Did you ever play sports growing up? Yes. I did gymnastics. Okay. How long did you do gymnastics? I'll take gymnastics. Is it gonna sport? Gymnastics is definitely a sport. I feel like this could be way more cute if they weren't like interrupting. Yeah. Oh my god. I'm trying to do a video here. I'm not gonna ask. You know that's every night. You know what? I wish I wish. But I don't know. You all want to give me all the opinions on a date? Yeah. Don't call him a girl anymore. That's her girl. A bro? Yeah. We gonna have I called you bro. Last night. Sorry. Please forgive me. Why'd you snapchat me three minutes ago? That wasn't me. Oh sh**. That's not you. What does it say? I said my snap. You really try to slide with them like you know like that? I didn't know this was f**king weird. While we're on a date, you're sliding in. This was a pretty good first date. All things considered pretty good. Thanks so. Yeah, I hope your friends support us. They all support us. No. Thanks buddy. Wait. This is the only girl I'm gonna ball. Oh my god. Why is it so swaying? I'm so sorry. You just break. You just friend zone guys every which way. On the first date. On the first date. You're kidding. Okay buddy. You wait. Where's the girls included in the date? Yeah, we're done. We're done. Thank you. Well guys, that concluded our date. You know what, it wasn't the most conventional date but overall it was pretty fun. Thank you Aubrey for taking me on this zoom date. Omega may seem a little bit creepy but good things come out of it. Anyways, love you guys. Thanks for watching and I'll see you in my next video. Bye.
