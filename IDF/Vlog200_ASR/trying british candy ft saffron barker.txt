 Hi guys, what's up? It's Sid. Welcome back to my channel. So today I'm here with a very special guys. Hi everyone, I'm Safron. We are going to be doing a collab today. If you guys don't know, Safron is from England actually. She is here visiting an LA for a week. We thought it'd be really fun to do a collab because we actually met a year ago. Pretty much exactly a year ago when I was thinking about moving to LA. We were both in LA at the same time. We were just like so random. So we stayed in touch and we just thought we'd be super fun to do a little video together. But basically for today's video, I'm going to be trying England candy or sweets as you call it. This will be so fun. I never had hardly any of these I don't think. And then on a Safron channel, basically I'm going to be living in the life of a typical American YouTuber. So basically I'm going to be following Sid these days. So make sure to check out Safron's video. I'll leave a link down below. This is so much candy already. We have so much in front of us right now. Okay, it goes now. Okay, so we're going to start off with a classic. Everyone's probably knows which one I'm going to put out first. The classic dairy milk, which I honestly, I didn't know that you didn't have this in the US. This is like our classic chocolate. I literally love everything in America, but I think the one thing that we have better is our chocolate. Okay, we have to be honest. I work. We don't like it. Just saying. Okay, I'll be very honest. I'll be very honest. Wow, it's big. Yeah. Big. Big. I'm going to show you what it smells like. A Hershey's kiss. Do you think so? I don't know. Cheers. You also keep it all up and I just shut the whole thing in my mouth. It's very dense. Oh my gosh, this is good. You know what? It tastes exactly like a Hershey's kiss. Like it tastes exactly like that. No, it does. If I were to read that, I would say that's like a mine and a half. Oh, okay. It was not expecting that. You would say it was next. A classic hop and ops. Oh, these are so good. I mean, actually these aren't the classic. We've actually got the classic and we've got the chocolate ones. Oh my goodness, this smells so good. I mean, it's just a biscuit, but it's just a good biscuit. When you dip the, like, do you like tea? Not really. Do you like coffee? No. No neither, but like, okay. If you get them in like teal coffee, it's a really classic English thing. It's good. It's a lot less sweet than I thought it was going to be. Really? It's very like dry. It kind of reminds me of like a graham cracker. Have you had a graham cracker? I didn't think so. No. Have you ever had a s'more? Yes. Okay. So that's what it is, right? Do you kind of see what I'm saying? I'm in kind of. I don't know. I would give it like a second. Okay. It's plain. But I haven't eaten it. Not really. You wouldn't. Well, if I was like hungry. Oh, sorry. I just have to smell them. To smell good. Hey, guys. Ooh, thank you. Oh my. Oh, it's so good. I like this one better. Mm-hmm. I told you. It's basically just what the dairy milk with, yeah, with the whole milk. Yeah, together. If I had this in my front room, I would go for the whole thing at a night. Like, they're so addictive. I like this because it's like the crunchy with like the sweetest of chocolate together. This is like a 8.75. Wow. That's really bizarre. So do you want to try the digestive to break it up? I mean, I'm sure. It's not breaking up. It's just getting the biscuits out and like, you can move on with the biscuits now. So this, in my opinion, it's like a smooth version. But you can see it's smooth, all right? Look. It's like a smooth version. I like this one better, actually. Yes. I do, too. What you need to rate that. Oh, you have an 8.75. I'll say that the same. Okay. Or I'll give it a night. Okay, wow. You know, I really don't care about the biscuits. All right, I'm moving on. Sweetie's sweets. Oh, dolly mix. Which sounds like marshmallows. Yeah, but you've got to eat them like as one. The best ones are the light little key points. These are my opinion of the best, best ones. But like, you've got to have like, them all at one go. So if you have it like this, take it like that and then put it in your mouth. Oh, so you have all three. Oh, cute. Well, because they all taste different. What do you think? I feel like you're really understanding. What does it taste like? Wait, these. I don't know what it is. It's like those sort of like, mates maybe? There's just like little mid things. I don't know what they're called. They used to eat them all the time. What's the, what did you just try? The brown one. That one tastes like, I don't know, or I don't know what it is. It tastes like molasses. You think so? Yeah. But do you know what though? Like these aren't really sold that much like in stores anymore. These are like an old sweet, so back in the day. I have a chocolate girl. So I'm going to give that I think like a seven. What's next? Okay. These ones look so cute. What the, the Milky Button. The buttons and there's a pink one in it. That's a bad vibe, very milk. So they'd let's be taste like, damn, I'm putting it in a button. Oh, wait, it's so like, I'm sad. I thought it was like, pigs. Oh, it's just little chocolate circles. It tastes like an oldie. I literally don't think it does at all. You have a try, or she's kissing it. Oh well, I'll go home today and I'll try it again. You're talking about this so different to me. Nine and a half out of ten. So good. Really? Yeah. I love the doughnut. You do now? Okay. That one's a fillet. You have something really similar. What do you like about the penne? Sometimes. Oh my gosh. I'll enjoy. I think that's what you have similar. It tastes like dairy milk chocolate again. But it's like thick. Oh, this is like an almond. Yeah. Yeah, I think you have some like, similar. Actually, one of my favorites. Really? Yeah. Is it better than the one that you have? What's it called almond joy? almond joy, I never really eat that. I feel like I like just the plain better though. Because I don't like dairy milk. Yeah. Because I'm not like a huge coconut girl, but like it's still good. Look at that. Just have it. Right. Moving on. We've got the maz bar. Which again, you have already some of it. Okay. That's really well. This is like, yes, you have something. This is so like it. It's your milky way. It's so fun. It's milky way. Okay. I think it looks like it. Mmm. This is good. What? This has caramel in it though. But I don't know if milky ways have caramel. See that's what I mean. I don't think they do. I think they do. Okay. That's still pretty good. Yeah. This is going well. This is like really good. This is so much more left. I mean, so good. Yeah, that is actually so much more. Should we bring it up? Yeah, you got it. Jelly balls. Jelly balls. Yeah. This is really cute. I feel like you're not going to like these that much. Are they similar to dots? Are they sugar? No. Okay. So these are like sugar. You have them as like a little kid. It's almost like a sour patch, kid, but not sour. Yeah. I don't like these better than these all in this. Really? Wow. Something we're not the same on. Okay. I'm going to give that. I'm going to eat. Oh my gosh. You don't have galaxy either. You have how she's there. What's your other bar that you have? Because these are like competitors. Yeah. And like in the UK, you people like a galaxy girl or you're like a dairy milk girl. Oh. I really have a competitor. I think it's like a chocolate monopoly. I really. You know, I actually think you're going to prefer this one. This is like more milky as well. It's so hard to explain, but they do taste so different. So different. You think it's different? I'm going to exam it's different. It's different a little bit. Oh, it's an African. It's a, I don't think it's that different. It is really? Now try the dairy milk. You will know to suck two different. It's really. I think it's like you said I think it's all the taste. There is definitely a little different. I feel like what's the one we just tried? Got it saved. Yeah. I feel like that tastes like dollar store chocolate. Really? I like the dairy milk better. I like the dairy milk better. And then my favorite chocolate bar in the whole world is the Carapace dairy milk fruit and that. Do you know why I like this? It's because I love raisins. Mmm. It's good. It reminds me of raisin eggs. Have you had those? They just chocolate raisins. Yeah. Wait, so what's your favorite thing here? Oh my, so the biscuits count. I didn't sure. Okay, I want cheese. The dairy milk fruit and that. We still have nine chocolate bars to go. Oh my gosh. Pinkwoods. This is cute. I know they actually are, but they're not pinking shapes. They're not pinking shapes. Just to warn you now. No. Oh, they all have pinking shapes on them. Oh my gosh. It looks like Kit Kat. Yeah. Kind of. Thank you. Alright, what's a penguin's favorite film? I don't even get this at all. Okay, got it. Frozen? Oh yeah, it's because I like it. Like the movie Frozen? Yeah. I don't think that's that funny. I don't think that's that funny. I didn't tell you. I didn't tell you it's bad jokes. Okay, that's great. That's great. Maybe it's a tasteful surprise. Oh, it's happening. Oh wait, this chocolate tastes like the other one. It tastes like Galaxy Chocolate. Is it not? I think so. No. I would say it's somewhat comparable to Kit Kat. Have you had a big gap? Yeah. But I think Kit Kat's aren't a lot better. Do you? Yeah, I don't know. It's like, it's just like, kind of too thick for me. I'll give this like an eight. The jokes are kind of an- Yeah. The jokes could be better. Alright, what's next? Ah, okay. So I feel like, because you have my notice of difference drink day milk and galaxy. You're not going to notice the difference. But these are like essentially the same thing. Competitors. But ones galaxy and ones caperies. Oh, is this supposed to be like that? Yeah, so that's what this is like too. That's interesting. On the inside, there's like chocolate that's like shaved. Yeah, and the same with this one. That was a bit full. Fine, I got it. So I just ate the ripple. Now this is the flick. Oh my gosh, I like this one better. Do you? So you're just a caprie's girl then. I am. Right, so next up, oh my gosh, she's like a wapper. Yes. I mean, it looks like that, but I do actually think these are better. Really? Yeah. I think these are just more like a crunchy, chewy or walker as well. I haven't tried them in a page so I might be wrong. They're good. I would say I'd say it in half. There's actually more. Oh, look, these are so popular. Mysticip, maybe, is like the brand again. That reminds me of Jesse, like a little lizard. Do you ever watch the show, Jesse? Yeah. The little lizard is being Mr. Kipling. Oh, yeah. I thought he meant the cancer I'm going to do with Jesse. I was like, I don't know how to do anything. Wait, this is so cute. They're really different. This is so messy. Just going in for seconds, sorry. Okay, that's like the most unique thing I think I've ever had. Really? There's like nothing that compares to that. It's so sweet. The texture is, I don't love the texture. It's kinda like gooey. Or, you know what I mean? Yeah, no, it is. I feel like it's too sweet for me. It's like too like faking sweet. Yeah. It is. It has that fake sugar. Faking sugar. Yeah. I like the look of it. I think it's the cutest like appearance. Ten and I have sent appearance. I would say tastes like a five. Okay, so you never really have that again. No. Yeah. But I don't like it. So I was quite generous then. Oh, this used to be my favorite chocolate bar. Taffy crisp. It tastes like a milky way. But with like crunchiness. Yeah. It kind of like a crunch bar. I'm going to give this like a eight. Okay. There's so much crunchiness. Oh, I put a bit of service back every while. But this has been going around forever. I don't actually think you have anything like this. It's like a hard caramel. Wait, it's like honeycomb. Yeah, that's what it is. Yeah. It's like little, it's like airy. This is so good. There's nothing really good. Yeah, I didn't think that was. Oh my gosh, this is so good. I mean, it was a nine and a half. I really? Oh, it's up there with the dairy milk. We've only got two more so should we do sweet? Sure. Repair cells. Yeah. Oh, it looks like life savers. Oh, so hard on your jar. It tastes just like the jelly parts. But like harder. I also think these are like, they actually like flavors. It's a strong love. I'll give that like a seven. Okay. Okay, I think I may have had a variant of this because I went to Europe two years ago. I went to Slovakia. They had, I think, years. If I can remember. Oh, it's not crunchy. No. Oh, look, we're eating it. Yeah, that's so good. It is good, right? I always forget that's a chocolate bar. I forget how good they are every time I have them. And that's Nestle. Yeah, it's another brand. Oh, you have that brand in America. I love that. I like how it's like light. It's like so dense, you know? I'm gonna give this a nine. I think my favorite of everything is the crunchy. It's so good. It is so good. It's probably because you have nothing like it as well. No. There's nothing like it. What do most people, if they go to get candy, it's wonderful. I feel like it probably is crunchy. Really? Yeah, I think so. I want to know the differences between, no, not the differences, but like which you both are. I think you both are as a whole. American candy or... Yeah. If I had to choose between American candy and British candy. I feel like just because I'm familiar with American candy I would have been really good. Yeah. But I really like your guys' chocolate. Wow, well thank you so much for filming. Because the dance is so much fun. Yeah. Yeah. Make sure to check out Safron's video on her channel. Oh, thanks. Yes, I'll leave a link to down below. But thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you in my next video. Bye guys. Bye.
