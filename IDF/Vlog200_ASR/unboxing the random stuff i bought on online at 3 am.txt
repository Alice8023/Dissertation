 Hey guys, it's said. Today's video, I first thought just to you say, my hair is no longer blue. I know no one actually probably cares, but... A couple months ago I did a video where I unboxed random things I bought online, and we're back doing round two because Amazon gets the best of me. Amazon Prime really came through. I ordered some very weird things. Honestly, I kind of forgot what I ordered. That's sad, it's been like two days. I'll remember once I started opening them. Basically, I just ordered the weirdest possible things I could find. I kind of just unboxed them, used them, and see what happens. I really forgot. Like, how did I forget? That's kind of embarrassing. Oh, guys, I'm not that out of shape. I just got a shot. I am usually out of shape, but not this out of shape. First box we have is... That's my address. Maybe I can open it with my hairbrush. These videos are so fun. Especially when you film them at like 2 a.m. Like I'm doing, it's just more exciting, you know? Things that happen at 2 a.m. are just more fun. Unicorn... what? Unicorn on gift mug. I think I opened a birthday gift. That was late. Oh my gosh, I feel bad. Do I tell my mom? I gotta tell her. Wait, I'm so confused. I don't know if I ordered this. Either way, it came to my house. It's an on-t corn mug. Like a normal on-t, but more awesome. I just do not think my mom would find you this. I really don't understand. Wait, hold up. Oh my gosh. Are you kidding me? I'm looking at my orders because I forgot as we talk about. One of the things I ordered was this mystery box. And I kind of was like, do I even spend $20 on a mystery box? And I was like, you know what, for the video. Just for the fun of the video. I'll order it. And this is what I get? What if my older brother didn't even have a kid? Then this would make no sense. I wouldn't even be an aunt. $17.99 for a unicorn dabbing. I feel disappointed. I'll say a solid two-ass in? No, zero out of ten. Not good. Let's try this again. So if you remember from my last video, I ordered a baguette pillow, which I still have. Don't know why. It's kind of like a weird thing. I don't know where it is though. Oh, I think it's in the trunk of my car. Yep, there it is. I got that pillow, which looked so fricking real. And it was sick. Like, I love it. No choice but to love it. And I love bread of carbs, which I've explained. When I buy weird things, it like senses that I'm buying weird things, so then it promotes to me weird things. So I had to check out guys. I saw these and my heart broke. I had to do this. I had to get them. I got on a spin-off of the baguette pillow. Loafers. Yeah. Yeah. You know what's up. That's a great plan. I cannot lie. I feel like my grandpa would actually like, really think this is funny. I should order him some. And they look so real. Again, my bread collection is coming along well. Got the pillow. Now got some slippers. Next. I don't know. What's next? I'll buy get bed. That's a little too far. I feel like that would be crossing the line for sure. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh, they look so cool. These like made my whole night. This is it. This is it for me. We should just end the video here. Oh my gosh. All my dreams have come true. That's my best purchase. I think of 2020. I'm officially a car lover. Lover. I can't talk. It's 2am. So far, this video is starting off great. You know what? I rate the loafers a 20 out of 10. Guys, why am I like this? So the next thing I got. This was also, you know, shown to me as a recommendation. Because it was a weird item. I got chili peppers. Should I try one? Just kidding. I'm pranked. Yeah, they're fake. Yeah, they're definitely not real. I literally got like 50 fake chili peppers. These look really legit. Like, I'm impressed. I think it was worth the $8. I'm going to do a prank with these for sure. Ash, can you come here for a second? I just don't know. Wait, don't go from here. I'm gonna choose another here. I got these chili peppers. Can you try one with me? Good try. Yeah. Everyone you show in here is so like, they're real though. They're real. They're real. Yes, they are. They're not real. Yeah, they are. Try it. Oh no. Okay, they need you right. Jack. What is next? This video is so odd. It's so weird, but that's why I love it. I saw this and I literally just thought it was a giant air pod. Does that not just look like a giant air pod? Well, actually now that I got it, it really does not. But at the time I thought it did. And then I like started looking into it. And it's called an otomatone. And basically, you can play music with it. So I thought, why not try it? I love music and I love being instrumental. I only play the piano. I'm like me getting it sound like I'm very musically talented. Does this not look like an air pod? Okay, so there's like a little face on it. I didn't even know that. It's a little interesting. I'm going to need to get some batteries for this. So, one sec. All right, just putting batteries in the giant air pod. This is the first for all of us. I hope the batteries work. They're kind of old. Okay, instructions. Hold otomatone like this. Push the stem. Play. Well, that doesn't help. Guys, this sound. It's not what I expected. Is mine broken? I'm confused. The problem is I don't even know the notes. There's no notes. You just play. So, let me just try to make a beat and prof. I'm sorry. I feel mean. And I don't mean to offend anyone or if a particular culture plays this. It's just kind of like an odd product altogether. It's confusing to me. But maybe I just have to learn actual songs, which I'll have to look up YouTube tutorials. Maybe I'll learn something good. I'm going to read it in a four out of ten. I think this is what I'm most excited about because I just think they look really cool. I saw chopsticks that were suggested to me. But these are just not any chopsticks. These are lightsaber chopsticks. Revolutionary. I know. The base of it actually looks like a lightsaber handle. This is so cool. I suck at using chopsticks. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. This is so cool. This reminds me of my fencing days. I used to fence. It's kind of like a very random fact about me. They literally are everything I wanted and more. Oh my gosh. Guys, I live in the life. Low curse and lightsaber chopsticks. How could it get any better than this? I have never been more of a freaking excited for something in my whole life. First step, turn them on. So I have some rice from dinner earlier. The thing is, I'm not good at using chopsticks in the first place. So I don't really know why I ordered these, but this is amazing. It even makes the food taste better. I don't know how, but it just does. You know what? Maybe this will make me want to learn how to use chopsticks more. It'll be more motivating. I'm going to rate these at 10 out of 10, guys. No hesitation, no contemplation. You can bet I'm going to be using these at all of my meals now. So when my family is using forks and normally utensils, I'm going to whip these out. The very last thing I ordered on Amazon is very weird. This is a dog to pay. I don't know. This is probably the weirdest thing out of everything. It makes no sense. There's really no purpose for this. It's just supposed to be weird looking and funny. I've seen photos of dogs in these and they look weird. So let's find her. Hello, Z. The thing is, I have two dogs, so I have to choose. Rosie, do you wear the one? The wig? You don't, I don't think you want to see it. Buddy? Buddy is really stiff. He's very old. Okay, I'm going to do it on Rosie. Oh, she's so cute. Oh, she doesn't like it. Rosie, come on, girl. This is so dumb. I think she's very confused what this is on her head. This is like the weirdest thing I've got for sure tonight. It just does not match her hair color at all. I don't know why I got this color. Sorry, Rosie. You know what? She took one for the team today. Okay, so I'm going to just end the video here. That's everything I got. I will say the last thing I got was the worst. I just didn't like it and it was weird. It was very bizarre. I don't know why I thought I'd be cooler. Like I was just expecting it to be so funny. And it really wasn't. So you know what? I'll give it a solid three out of ten. Thanks guys for watching this video. I hope it entertained you. I hope it was fun. It entertained me. I had a lot of fun with this video. I'm tired if you can't tell. I should probably go to bed if you want another video like this comment below. This was fun. It was honestly really interesting. I think my favorite thing. I can't choose if it's the loafers or the lightsaber chopsticks. Both are 10 out of 10. The videos like these are just so fun to make because they're so weird. But that's like what makes them fun. You know what I'm saying? But yeah, I love you guys. Thanks for watching. Yet another strange video. And I'll see you in my next video. Bye guys.
