 Yo! Pee! Pee! No. Hey guys, it's Sid. I got comments in my last video that I like didn't say hey guys it's Sid and then I just got really sad. Can I just like tell you something for a second? I hope you said yes. School this week has been hard for me. Okay, it's been a really rough week of macroeconomics and calc. There's only so many hours in a day. 24 as we know it. And I have stuff to do. I have a lot of stuff to do. Sometimes you gotta just pull them all lighter and tonight is one of those nights. I'm gonna be doing homework but I'm also gonna have some fun while I'm doing it. I have 8 a.m. class. So I don't know if I specified that but I meant like the next morning. I had an 8 a.m. And I tried to pull them all lighter. I don't know why I did this but anyways. I'm starting the evening out the best way I could at Chick-fil-A. Why am I so tired already? This is not a good start. Here's the thing. I'm not trying to glamorize on nighters because they're actually bad for your help. Sleep is so important and I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't have to. But sometimes things have to get done. Alright. Funny games are over. So now I gotta study. I think we all knew that one was coming. Also I don't have a desk which is like kind of inconvenient. Wow. It has been a fun couple hours of pure calculus. If you work for too long without taking a break your brain is going to fail. When I was at Ralph's I saw this. This is the thing from TikTok. I think that like everyone bites into and it like sounds like an apple. I always wanted to try it. I don't know. You want to bite my teeth? I'm kind of scared to do this. Wait I feel like an idiot. I feel like this whole thing is like a joke and it doesn't even do anything and people like edit the sound on. There's no way. Oh. This is like an apple. The rest of you apple. Yeah it doesn't sound good. That's the thing. Oh. Also it is like legit. It's not like my tooth crack. I saw Wendy's way off from. I saw. Oh. I saw. I saw. Wendy. Yeah. Love free. Love free speaking pitch. I feel like I'm really like a failure. So stuff happened. What's even the last thing I videoed? Oh I think the last thing I videoed was the apple juice thing. Yeah. Basically I have been doing literally nothing for two hours. Like just straight watching TikTok and wasting the night away. For no reason. So it's time to get productive again. It's 218. Yeah class starts and... Six hours for me. I'm actually like not that tired anymore. It's weird. Like once it gets so so late, I almost get less tired. Which is kind of bad. Oh also I kind of change outfits. But no one really asked so. I'm gonna study a bit more. But first I want to make cookies. Oh also my roommate is sleeping. So we gotta be quiet. Like why am I doing this? I would leave your eye, I would leave your smile. I would leave you feel like five feet. You really know I was gonna do the walk. Alright cookies are on the oven. I'm gonna get to work. I'm doing some business emails now actually. Because um... Yeah. Oh my gosh my back is like... I'm really 80 years old. Oh my gosh okay it's time to check the cookies. And I'm like dead inside. And on the outside. Every time. Oh my goodness. Guys the cookies are done. Okay. Um. I feel like they definitely are undercooked but... It's subpar at best. You know I'm not gonna lie. Oh my gosh. Wow. I have five more hours. Guys it's getting freaking cold in this house. Oh my gosh. Yeah I basically worked for a while. And I worked pretty hard. Like I'm pretty proud of myself. And I actually fell asleep on accident. And oh please don't hate me. Around like 6 a.m. And this is me waking up right nearly for my 8 a.m. the next morning. Oh my gosh. This is when I regret like the old days. Like why did I do that? So yeah I definitely won't be turning on my camera today. And I get rid of the sun in my little day. Yeah. This is my fun time. Lose my bus. Beautiful. Lose my size. Uh so after class I actually fell back asleep for like 5 hours. This was a pretty hard video for me but I'm glad I did it. Almost. You know I almost made it. Okay I made it by like almost an hour. Obviously I forgot to an outro per usual. Um but I just want to say I love you guys. Thank you so much for watching. I'll see you in my next video. Bye guys. Bye.
