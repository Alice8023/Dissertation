 Woo! Oh my god! How long do we have left? The applause is ready. I don't know! Hahaha! No! Oh my god! The applause is ready! The applause is ready! I don't know! Hahaha! No! Oh my god! Hello, Ha! Hey guys! So, I just wanted to quickly pop in. If you didn't see part one, I basically decided to move from LA to Minnesota. It was just a rough time, you know. Please don't judge. You know, not that you would. But, just cut me some slack. I did not feel my best nor look my best. But that's not what matters, you know. What matters is documenting the realness and the honest of the trip. Not all parts are glamorous, but such is life. Hopefully you enjoy. If not, I don't know what to say. Let's get into the video, baby. Woo! Guys, it's for the long night. Hey, it's going to be even a longer two day right now. I know! Road trip starts now. Wish us luck. We'll see you on this side of the Rockies. No, we're assuming we'll wait two seconds. We got some go-go squeezes. Hands at the ten and two. I'm doing perfect. Okay, first stop of the trip. Woo! So we're at the gas station now. We've been driving for like what, three hours? No, only two. I wish it was three. Why is my trunk open? I'm sure it wasn't open the whole time. Yes. You sure? Oh, I just got my phone. Dad! Okay, it doesn't look like anything fell out. It's time to stretch. Wow, I cannot believe we're about to drive for another. How long do we have less? Okay, so we're now stopping for food. We're at the Panier Drive-through. My dad and I are very differently, so. That's food rules. They're not open yet. Hi, favorite chicken from the other party. How can I help you? Can I get whatever is a small similar to Egg McMuff? Yes. What's that, mother? Yes, scrambled, yeah. Can I do that? You pick two. Okay, so my dad really wanted to bring my red baguette to the house you can probably see. I told him not to, because I just didn't think we had enough room. Oh, come on. A little thing like that. I really hope the Chinese colors are fine. I just walked out there and do it. So it was like fried chicken. I got some facial spray for us. Want some? No, open the new one. Thank you. Did you need it today? I'm so excited. Dad never had to stand up for an error before I always get the same thing. So this is out of my comfort zone. Wow, honestly, 10 out of 10, I really recommend you guys try it. Do you want me to stop and get another one? No, thank you, though. That was nice. I know what a mukbang is. You know, it's when you eat and talk. Oh, learn something new. Okay, hello, update tonight. We are now on our 12th. I mean, please stop it properly. I work early in Vegas. I've never been to Vegas before. So it's just so interesting. So yeah, now we are basically going to Utah. I have always been fascinated by Utah. I don't know why I've always loved it and see pictures of it. But I've never actually been to Utah. Comment down below. Do you think we look like everyone thinks he looks like you. We look like everyone thinks he looks like Joey from Friends. Yo. You know. What's happening there? Utah is next in their horizon. Utah or bust. Utah bust? I can't go back to the city's crap. It's all back there. Don't worry me. You have so many problems. One thing. Not a thousand. I don't know. I don't know. What's fire in this is hitting. We know. I need sugar. Oh my gosh. It's like spicy. It's not supposed to be spicy. I'm serious. It makes no sense. This is fruit. Maybe you think it's supposed to be spicy but it's not. I just kidding. Prank even pranks. That's not a prey. Punk. You punk right? Yo. What's she doing? What? That's Joey. Hello everyone. I feel like it is time for an update. It's been four or five hours probably since I talked to you. I was going to update you sooner but I fell asleep. There are no stores or gas stations for like 200 miles. The last 100 miles we're driving. We almost ran out of gas. I feel like I'm at my lowest point right now. But you know what? That's what you choose. You know what? That's what you choose. But you know that's what you choose is all about being real raw. At least that's what I like to be. So this is how close we were. Okay, it's kind of close. We're in the middle of nowhere. That's a problem. Subway you my homie. Okay guys, hello reporting live from St. Carbine last 10 for hours. I'm tired. I know. We got some really good cookies at Subway. Oh, I should have taken them all. Oh, stop. Oh, again. What? You're filming again? Yes, I have to keep them updated. Oh my gosh, that was so long. I don't know. Everything is packed. I don't know how I'm going to change. Oh my gosh, honey. Where do you sell your... They're all tucked away. How about toothbrush and... It's all packed away. I was... Seriously, seriously. What are you going to do? What are you going to do? It's cold out. You should get your stopping for a bit. If you're going to do it, because I don't want to wait. I'm ready to hit the head, as they say. My dad and I got different hotel rooms, because he snores really loud. We have to leave at 6 a.m. It's going to be an extremely long day of driving. I don't want to get the camera. Hello. Um, uh, hi. Good morning. Basically, I'm wearing sunglasses right now, because I look absolutely terrible. It is currently at 614 a.m. Maybe... Woo! Okay, that's the spirit. Dad, I want to show you this on camera, because I was salty. I feel like if I tell you on camera, I'm going to be like less salty about it. Last night, I almost went on a two-room because even though we were in separate freaking rooms, I could hear you snoring. That was the guy next to me. Whoa! Wow, so I'm going to sleep right here, so I'm going to go to the restroom. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's going to be a long trip driving or going to end. Gosh, you want to try it while I'm in there? Okay. This thing is not suctioning. It's an issue. Dad, it's not working. I don't know what's not working here. What are you doing? I don't know what to do. I tried my part to keep my effort. I'm going to be honest, I think you broke it. Okay, I'm going to have my breakfast. It hasn't worked since I got my breakfast. It worked the first day. Okay, guys, we just got Panera. We just got Panera, and I really want to show you guys. Look, this is a fake baguette pillow. This is real. Okay, that's a really bad comparison. But, like, is that kind of cool? That kids. I'm feeling a lot more tired today. Yes, dad, it's super pumped, you know? Do you remember what this is called? I told you yesterday, what is it called when you eat and talk on camera? Oh, smack dawn, something. Smack up. Muckbang. Oh, muckbang, okay. Nimbus connects. We'll see you then. Peace out. Wait, hold on. What's up? Got it. Ew! What is this? Dad! Dad! No, no, no, no, you just dropped the cookies. Oh, wait. It's my hair. I can't eat them anymore. That's your hair. I feel like going out with my pants. I'm like, you're pushing this left over. Dad, what is this? What is this video? I'm like, you pushed them over my head. I didn't know that that happened. And now I can see that all of them. You guys can just cookies off the seat. I wonder if I could. Step one, put them into the plastic computer. I know what to do. I know. Oh, inside the bag. Gosh. That's just good. That is so disgusting. Guys, we made it! This is our final set, though. Guys, we're literally pulling up to the house right now. I can't believe it. Welcome to Minnesota. I just can't believe after all of that. We're finally freaking here. I just had to get this moment on camera while I'm seeing my house. We did it! I would definitely say that it's worth it to take cross country trip. It was worth it. Maybe, maybe. Give yourself more than, you know, 48 hours like we did. It definitely worth it. It was actually really fun. It just got a little long at the end, but we're here. Yeah, I didn't have an outro either. Basically, we got home and knocked out. And that's the end. So, hope you guys liked the video. It's a little bit different, but I really enjoyed it. Thank you so much to my dad for going all the way across the country for me. I cannot even begin to thank him. But it was such a fun trip, and I'm so glad that you guys were able to be a part of it. Yeah, I love you guys. Please stay safe. I cannot wait to make so many videos during this time. Thanks for watching. And until next time, peace out.
