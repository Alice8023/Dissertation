 It's gonna be an interesting week. Hey guys, it's Sid. I'm starting to do a video out on Sunday night at 10.20pm. I have to wake up tomorrow at 5am because I'm gonna be waking up at 5am every single day this week. And for what? I really don't know. No actually, I do know. Let me explain. I've been going to bed. I'd like 2am every night. It's not a good schedule. You guys are basically holding me accountable to this. Every day this week, I'm gonna try to do something fun in the mornings just to get me up and going. Oh my gosh, it's early. This is the hardest part of every morning. 3, 2, 1. I'm so dramatic. Oh my gosh. I feel like I didn't sleep. I feel like I just went to bed. Does that make sense? One of the first things I do every morning is chug the glass of water. I think the best way to just kick off this week would be to go to Duncan. Let's go get some coffee. Let's start the week out right. I truly believe that being positive can just help make things a lot better and a lot easier. Can I have a medium iced caramel latte? Okay. Look how dead the target parking lot is. I don't even know if it's open actually. I feel like it's too early. I always get their hash browns. They're so good. Wow. So now I have an hour and a half before my class even starts at 8am. This is actually my first day of second semester. Last semester, I would always wake up two minutes before class started and I would just sit in bed and do class. This semester, I'm trying to switch it up. New year new me. Not really, but also is it weird that I'm not tired? I feel like I should be more tired right now. Cheers to a good week of waking up at 5am. I'm about to have my first class. I also have teeth learning services. Hopefully they don't make me turn my camera on. But they're definitely going to make me turn my camera on. Ready to see you. See me. Hi, I'm Popsky. Hi, I'm here. Day one is officially over. I feel tired. I really feel like I had a really productive day today, honestly. I think getting up early just set the tone for my day. Tomorrow I'll see you guys for day two. I'm not in my screaming, my roommate is sleeping. See you guys tomorrow. I'm well, happy day two. I was going to workout, but I'm honestly just, I can't. Like I just can't do that today. So instead I thought I would try to be productive this morning and I already made my bed. I'm proud of myself. I put it on a face mask because I'm bored. I think last night I got it total of four and a half hours of sleep. Maybe that's the problem. Oh my god. If I see any screen stuff for that, I might have to block you. Okay so I just finished my workout. I feel actually so much more energized. I have schooled about 45 minutes so before then I'm going to start drinking Miss Celsius. I think the hardest part of the day for me is genuinely just getting out of bed. Like it did take me 30 minutes this morning. I did hit snooze a couple times. I have to get studying before class. Zoom, you need. Zoom, you need. Zoom, you need. Hey guys, so surprised I'm tired. What, wait what day is it? Oh well technically now it's Thursday. 5 a.m. 5 a.m. See you in the morning. Good morning guys. This was not a good morning for me. Like I'm just going to be out of this. I woke up at 5 and then it's the truth. I woke up at 5 and then I fell back asleep. Nobody perfects. Please don't roast me in the comments. So here we are. What the heck was that? So anyways I'm going to make some breakfast and I had to make a really fun elaborate breakfast. Usually I just like have a yogurt. Today's menu, waffles, eggs. That's actually it. Oh shoot. What is that? Oh my gosh, slightly burned. Are these edible? I definitely don't think they're... Yeah, you're not going to want to eat this. It's burnt. Good morning. Okay. So guys, this is the last day of me waking up at 5 a.m. And I don't think I could be more excited. You're so tired. I'm going to die on my inside. Okay, I think we need to go to the dark end. Yeah. I'm going to go to the dark end. Basically. Maddie offered to do this with me for the last day and wake up at 5. Best room you're worried. Why is it so fun? We woke up for a pretty sunrise and then we get to this. It's sitting on the spot. Okay, can I have two caramel and a plate? What's that? I'm medium. Is the southwest venue power sandwich good? I school girls might get ice coffee in the morning. Maybe not wake up like this. I woke up like this. Oh, thank you. I'm so scared to bake. I'm so scared to bake. How are you still saying bag? I say it like bag. I got a new sandwich. I got this begging thing. I don't even know if it's going to be good. Veg is good. Yeah. I don't really know. Kind of weird. Should I end the video? Maddie. Well, we have a lot of eddies. Yeah, I'm going to turn it on. I think I'm just going to like recap this week as a whole. Waking up at 5am was honestly harder than I even thought it was going to be. However, once I'm up, I actually really enjoy it. It's like that delayed gratification. I'm glad I'm up. I get so much more done. It just sets the tone for my day. Props to you because she was up early every day this week. Thanks for joining me on this last day. It was amazing to have you. So yeah, would I do this again? Probably not. If I woke up like 7, that's more doable for me. So I'm definitely going to try to do that. But thank you guys for watching. This was fun. I'm dead. I think I'm a robot. I'm like, thank you for watching. Subscribe to my channel. Love you Maddie. Thank you for watching. Peace. Ciao. Oh, hey. Didn't see you there. Oh my god. That was really bad. I didn't see you guys. I didn't see you guys. I didn't see you guys. I didn't see you guys. I didn't see you guys. I didn't see you guys, I didn't see you guys. I didn't see you guys. YouJohn tomorrow. No. I didn't see you guys, I didn't see you guys. Go on. Bye? She doesn't know the place. Fall off. We'll end this part. Hope you enjoyed it. See you next time. Peace. She.
