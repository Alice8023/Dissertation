 Hey guys, it's said, welcome back. I feel like I look extra young today, but that's okay. You know what, one of my biggest securities used to be, no, securities. One of my biggest insecurities used to be that I feel like I look really young and people would treat me a little bit younger, but that's okay. You know what, I don't know why I started going down that rabbit hole. Today, I'm going to be doing a video that has been really never requested. Actually, I don't think I've seen one person request this video. Ooh, like I was the only one that requested it for myself. I decided to be fun to kind of just spin off of my other videos in the past where I would get fast food, like vegan fast food and try it on camera. But instead of getting vegan fast food into a get taste test, I thought it'd be fun to compare French fries from different restaurants. Recently, I've been eating a lot of French fries and specific potatoes in general, but specifically hash browns, French fries. I would say mostly French fries. I just think this would be fun. So if you want to see where the best French fry can be found, according to me, I don't know. Some people say I have weird taste, so I feel like this is so random. I guess my whole channel is like random. Like that's like the fun of it is. You just never know what's going to come next week, you know? Like maybe next week I'll be doing... I'm doing different brands of band-aids and seeing which one sticks best. You never know. And that's like the fun of it, I think. I don't know. I don't know that time. I'm just like, you know, we only have cash right now. Yeah, I have cash. Can I just have a French fry? 181. Okay. Is your like hard thing broken or... Ooh. This smells so good. I don't remember when the last time was that I got French fries from McDonald's. Like honestly, it's been a while, which is kind of sad. Here's the fries. They're really hot, so that's an A plus. If my fries are not warm, it's an OGO. Like cold French fries are one of the worst foods I personally feel. Okay, let me try it. Pretty good. Could use a little more salt. These fries are like a 5 out of 10 in the salt skill. I'm going to try it with ketchup because I feel like it always eats French fries with ketchup and I just don't know how to compare it without it, you know. I hate the sweet packets. See, I just feel like people that eat French fries without ketchup are like a different breed. Oh my gosh, they're so good with the ketchup. There's really nothing wrong with these. Besides the fact that there could be more salt. They're warm. They're crunchy. They're crisp. They got the potato-y inside, obviously. I don't really know how to describe French fries. I'm going to rate this an 8.5. No, I'm going to rate it an 9. We're starting out strong. Maybe later in the video I'll look back and I'll be like those who are not as good as I thought they were compared to the other ones, but we have to start it somewhere. Boy, where do you get the best French fries? What? The best French? Why did I hang out? That was a joke. I hate you, I hate you. I don't know, I like getting out of fries, but that's very rare. Oh, those are terrible. Okay, so you're not credible after that. You're not good. Goodbye. They said you're not credible at them. Hi, could I just have a small fry? So for reference, the fries are a whole dollar more, so my expectations are pretty high. Hi, hi, small fry, right? Yes. Okay, let's just take a look. Like aesthetically, how the fries are presented. Oh, okay. I like this better. I really like that these are in a cardboard package. You know what, it might not be the most environmentally friendly, but like the McDonald's fries and this is just kind of harder to eat. I'm being so dramatic. They're also definitely thicker. I immediately regret my McDonald's rating. Maybe later on the video I'll look back and I'll be like those who are not as good as I thought they were. These are good. I don't even need ketchup. That's when you know they're good fries. They're so thick, they're so crispy. They're a lot crispier than McDonald's. Inside, they're soft. It's just so good. Wow, we literally get up right now out of your seat, go to Burger King and get their french fries. Do I like give it a 10? No, I'm gonna give this a 9.5 out of 10. Maybe I just don't eat fries as much as I thought I did and these for some reason are so good. Burger King, you impressed me. How am I already getting full after coming to restaurants? I think it's because I'm just eating like every part of it. Hi, can I please just have a small french fry? Curly or crinkle? Oh, I'll do one of each. Alright. Thank you. Thank you, too. Got my fries, curly and crinkles. Crinkled or curly? Not neither. I don't like crinkle and I like the straight ones from McDonald's. Do you want me to try, I'll try this on camera with you. My mom was watching live. Is that weird? Curly and what the heck is this called? Crunchy or crinkled? Crinkled, okay. I'm gonna try this one first. Alright. See, those look seasoned. Like they're seasoning on them. Mmm. They're good, but I like basic fries better than this. This seasoning is good on this, but like if I had to choose, I would just choose normal fries. Yeah, I am not a curly fry girl. I like the regular plain fries. So I'd rate the curly like a six. I gave it a four, but okay. Next we have, oh, I'm cleaning your car after this. We got the crinkled. Mmm, interesting. They're not that good. Like, alright, like they're fine, but they're just like very basic. I give them a seven. Like they're middle of the road. Would I go back? No. And I never go to Arby's anyways. Favorite might be, like what you can just throw in your oven at home for the crinkles. What do they do? Yeah. Arby's wasn't too impressed. I'm serving up to KFC Kentucky Fried Chicken Yeehaw. I need to cleanse my palate a little bit. Listen, um, hey, can I have a small fry? I'm 30, 20. Thank you. 320. Why is it like kind of expensive? Better be the best fries I've ever had in my life. Thank you. Never gonna. Thank you, too. So these are the fries they unfortunately fell out. Imagine if they just like gave me like, it like this. Dude, at this point they're kind of all blending together. There's definitely a lot of seasoning on these and like a lot of salt. I think it's at the most salty. I don't know how to say this, but they're crispy but also limp, which I kind of like that combo. I'm gonna give this a, you know, what I ever choose to go here. Yeah, definitely not. Wait, actually no, I just remembered these are like the most expensive by far. They're good, but they're not worth 385 or whatever it was for a small fry. No. Alright, we're going to the next restaurant. I'll see you soon. I think I'm most excited about this place that we're at. I don't know what it is about when these, but actually I do know what it is. Let me just start over. It's the frosties. It's their chicken nuggets. It's... That's actually it. Alright, I'm getting French right out. I'm not gonna lie. I have these pretty often, so I kind of know what to expect. See, I think this is going to change me. Now that I've tried all these different places, these aren't as good to me anymore, which I even hate to say because I just love Wendy's. Oh my God, yeah, they're just not as good anymore, but they're just too crispy for me. So I'm gonna make these like a six. Oh my gosh, Wendy's your frosties will always slap, so... I'm gonna make these like a six. Guys, I don't feel too good. I have a feeling it's all the fries I've been eating, but anyways, I'm not here to complain. Nobody cares. Oh my gosh, I just tried it without even... Okay, I just like started eating it. That was weird. Well, I got the burger king fries, and I've already started eating them, so sorry, I don't know why I just did that. I don't like them. There's like nothing's better about these at all. I've just not like they're really crispy, they're really soft, they're really salty, they're just extremely basic, and they kind of have a weird aftertaste. I mean, I'm being dramatic, but they're really not that good, like at all. Like this is an easy to out of ten for me. This is definitely the last place I would order fries from of everywhere I've been so far, which says a lot, because I've been through a lot of freaking places. They're not that good, what the heck? That's definitely the first fries I've got that I've been like, oh, these are not good. And I've had a lot today, so that says a lot. This last place is unique, it's different, it's Chick-fil-A. Chick-fil-A's one of my favorite places, and their fries are different because they're waffle fries, so I'm gonna grab those, see how they compare to the rest of the fries we've had. It goes to me. Where do I even like put this food on it? I just like roll with space. I got stuff from my mom and brother too, so. Here's the first thing I want. Thank you. Thank you. I'm glad I was there, how'd you get that food? Oh my gosh, I've played it gone through the most dreads in one day that I have in my life today. But I'm not mad about it. I think my stomach is pretty freaking mad about it. Oh my gosh, this is the last fry I'm eating today. I'm actually so happy about that. I want to say I'm saving best for last, but I think I've had some really good fries today. It's gonna be tough to compete. I've just had so many fries at this point, like they're all meshing together for my head. But these are different because they're crinkle or no, they're waffle style. Yeah, okay. Oh my god, I don't know what it is. I don't know if it's a placebo effect, like it was just my mind, or if they're actually just really good. Because the fries that are waffle style are always better to me. They're really good. They're like crispy enough on the outside, soft enough on the inside. I do wish they had more salt though, but I just feel like the texture I've always felt that way and I've tried to like figure it out, because they're ultimately the same thing as like a basic fry, but something about them just hits different. I'm gonna give them an eight because I feel like there's definitely better waffle fries out there that I've had. Oh my gosh, I'm never eating fried in. I hope you enjoyed today's video. It was kind of weird, it was kind of random, but I thought it'd be fun. And you know what, I just think it was a fun experience for me. Towards the end, it got less fun because I got more sick. I want to say verdict is go to burger hang, front of the french fry of your dream. Also though, if you don't like crispy fries, don't go there because I just really like crispy french fries. So burger king, thank you. Now I'm going to be going back to you guys before our french fries. That's it, because I don't really eat your burgers, but I love you guys. Thank you for watching this interestingly weird video. I hope you liked it. If you have any videos you want to see for me as always, I'll leave them down below. I read like basically every single comment or at least I try to. Yeah, let me know what you guys want to see, but I love you guys and I'll see you soon. Bye.
