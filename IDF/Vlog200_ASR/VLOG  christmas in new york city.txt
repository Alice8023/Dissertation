 So I'm getting ready for a party. I was just like talking about it feeling like in my last vlog I don't want to go out anymore and now here I am. But it's for a good reason. It's my friend My 21st. I'm sure a lot of you guys know who she is and I'm so excited. I haven't seen her like so long. I know that the theme of this vlog is Christmas and I don't really know how Christmasy tonight will be and then my fam is actually flying in right now. They're on their flight. So right after her party I'm just gonna come back and be with them all week. The dress code is black tie. I'm so bad with dress codes like every time that I go somewhere and they're telling me what the dress code is I always have to google it. I never I never know. This is kind of like all I have that fit what I thought was the vibe. It's this little short black cocktail dress. Wait guys I think this is way too edgy. So I reread her text. She said it's black tie slash sleek and mysterious. Okay so because there's a slash like emphasis on the slash I feel like I don't want to be too black tie then. I kind of don't know where they use like should I bring them. So I'm the last one just to make you look mysterious. So what are we in? Into. Oh my god. Okay vlog I missed you. It's a Makase town. New York sushi club in the house today. Thank you all so much for coming. Hi. I'm with the birthday girl. Hey vlog. I missed Sydney's Reno back in the house. New York, New York. Weed of OG's and we met in LA running around like little girls sitting on a star bump. Yeah I remember that. Do they want to talk down to this? You're just young. No literally but it's so crazy how we both are now in New York City. I'm like I'm not used to looking at this G7R in a past day grotesque. Okay so I just got back and she gave us these gift bags. That's so nice. Look how much stuff there is in here. Chapstick, serum. Oh Laura Mercier cleanser. I'm gonna have to watch this thank you. Merry Christmas. Hey guys I'm with my family. Hi. Say hi. Hi. Atoms in my apartment for the first time. Yes lots more than what I thought it would be. So we're going to the rockettes tonight right? Oh my family's visiting I should have said that. I haven't done any of the touristy things really in New York Christmas wise. I've been waiting for them to come. So Ash I'm gonna take this subway for the first time. Yes. How do you feel? Hopefully it's no volume. What are you talking about? They're seeing pranks with me mold like fake bomb. Like on the subway. That's what she never seen that like. Okay. Ash in the first time taking the subway. Yay. Wait are we not pulling? Hold on to something. I'm going to add more of this most oversimulating store. Need. Would you associate with me if I wore that hurt? Yeah. Really? Yeah. So we stumbled upon this little market in Times Square. And there's all these little shops that are Christmas themed. It's so cute. Look at it. Hey, I'm sitting. I didn't get any brilliant. I don't want to squeeze that up. So the one that's good. No, I don't want to get close to that. I hate when they ask volunteers. I think that's why because Spiris being asked to be like a volunteer and something like that. We're at the Rockefeller tree. So pretty. So cool. It is. It's so pretty. It's smaller than we thought though. Is it it's one you thought? Oh yeah, I thought it'd be 10 times bigger than it was. I think it's a little bit bigger than it was. It's so pretty. It's so pretty. It's so pretty. It's so pretty. It's so pretty. It's so pretty. Okay, so we had dinner. We stopped at this like, taco place. And now we're at the Rockettes. The boys are getting us hot chocolate. We are going to eat my mom's weight for them. Thank you. They got us hot chocolates. They're so nice. What the Christmas spectacular logo on. I'm so star. It's about to start. We have our hot chocolate. After every family event, we like to do little ratings of things. I rated it a nine. Dad, would you rate it? Nine plus out of 10 for sure. Mom. 10 out of 10. Nashon. Sorry, this point. Seven out of 10. I didn't hate it, but I thought it was, man, I was okay. I just made all the dancing kind of, I don't know, got a little, a little more. This kind of just maybe you want to go see the Nutcracker even more. I was going to go and I just, I did dispel the grip. We should do that if we could drop something on over there. Okay, we took like the worst photos. I'm square like that. Like I actually cannot. Those looks so awkward. They're so awkward because my dad like demanded a photo. We taken by a professional photographer. Yeah. They go. It's so bad. Hey guys, so it's now, third day. I'm so excited because we're actually about to leave to go to Brian Park. I've never been. I've heard so fun and festive to go here around Christmas time. I think my parents like rented like a little snow globe cubicle thing. So I'm really excited for this. This is like the one thing we had planned in advance. Okay, wait, I have to tell you guys what I did. I feel like really guilty. Basically there's this soap store called A soap. It looks like this. I'm definitely not saying it right. I always wanted to get soap from them. But I could never justify spending $40 on soap. But the way I justified this was being like, okay, my family's coming to visit. So they'll be able to use this and enjoy it, I guess. And before I even like told them anything about it, they were just like, oh, we don't like the soap in your bathroom. Like we think it's so bad. I'm enjoying it myself. So anyways, fail. Okay guys, we're taking the subway. It's a ride. Okay, so we're here. It's so much bigger than I thought it would be. They have hot chocolate everywhere, which I love hot chocolate. I drink it like every day in the winter. Like, look how many flavors they have. Oreo, that's one that I told my dad we should get. Wow, that actually tastes like Oreo. Where did our parents go? They're right here. It's like What is this? It already tastes like gasoline. Yeah. What's that? Gasoline. Gasoline, how would you know gasoline taste like? My parents rented this with giant egglue for fun. It's so cute in here and it's warm. Can you tell you found this on TikTok? I did. Look how cute it is. Here, they also have what's that called? Curly. So my dad's teaching me how to play shuffleboard. Or wait, wait, wait, what is this called? It's called curly. Like this. I need more glue. We gotta be able to slide it. On the ground. Get lower to the ground. Get lower to the ground. So it's the next day. I know it doesn't look like it's somewhere. I'm basically the same thing. But we're in central part. As you can tell. What if we just been in like saying, I'll pay $20. No. 50. Alright. I've run into my family loves home alone. I'm going to buy a new one. I'm going to buy a new one. I'm going to buy a new one. I'm going to buy a new one. I'm going to buy a new one. This is home alone. Especially Ashen. Oh yeah. We're going to go try to see the bridge that they filmed on in home alone. All this is where they filmed the part at the very end where Kevin blew up the thing. The firework stop. So what's in her mouth? We found this little place. It's called New Merrill 28. The red wine is the best. That's my favorite drink ever. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it.
