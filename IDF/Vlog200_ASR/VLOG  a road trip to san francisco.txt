 Hey guys, it's said well, no, not so fake. Hey guys, it's said that's so much better. I want you guys to look me in the eye real fast. I'm kind of start by saying, this morning I woke up at seven. No way. Then I drove two and a half hours to James' house. No way. You're lying. That's my water you know. Say we have a five hour road trip ahead. Can you look? Okay guys we are now on our way. What hour are we on? We're almost there. We're not almost there. Let's decide. Hey guys, we're now going to dinner. It's almost 7 pm. We're in San Francisco. Good morning. Good morning, bald. San Francisco. Do we tell the vlog? Do we film? We were eating and I saw this boy and I thought he was cute. And Jake was like I'll go up to him with Nia and like kind of like plug you. Yeah, I'm a good plug for sure. So we made a whole plan and we were like okay Sid's going to go to the bathroom and me and Nia are going to go talk to him. I was like yo what's up dude. I'm a have a friend who's in the bathroom right now. She was two and hers come up but she's super awesome. And then we had Nia show a picture of Sid need to. I was like yeah she's super cool. Maybe you guys could add each other and snap. All of a sudden I said yeah yeah dude do it. And he was like he was so boring. He was like oh yeah sure. So they were like all right we'll be right back when she gets out of the bathroom. We brought her back over to Ryan and I was like okay well. And then he was like he didn't even ask for anything. And I was just standing there and I was like I'm so weird. And then I was like I'm kind of sweet. He was like so pointless. Ryan if you're watching you missed out. Are you breaking water? Yes. Okay guys so we're done with brunch. We're now at the museum. We're taking photos. Jake thinks my angle suck. Oh this is a mirror. Wait. My body doesn't crack. Dr. Cracket. Somebody in the comments are going to be like he's not a car proctor. He should be doing that. You're doing it right now. So guys we made it to the place that Sid says is where the full house homes are. Which I don't think it is. It's eight minutes away. We made it to a place that looks like it. So it's just as good. Even better. I know Sid is doing her little photo shoot with Jake. Okay Sid. She knows how to pose. She knows her angles. And Jake's a good best friend. Okay. Okay. We tried to put this down. Yeah I tell her. Like this little blanket like I think it's called like a Turkish towel or on the grass but Jake's butt got wet when he sat down. Was not the move. So we're not sitting down now. Anyways. Okay guys so we're back home now. I did my hair. Actually I need other hair. I didn't do it. And we're getting ready for dinner. We're going to this like pretty nice restaurant so we're dressing up. Ooh. What's up vlog. What's up vlog. We're just discussing how like sneaky links are meant to be sneaky. Do we have any sneaky links though? No. Since they're sneaky links should they be known to the general public probably. You will all like post their sneaky links and like this is my secret link. I'm like why? Like isn't that the whole question do sneaky links? Spend me. Oh wait it's kind of dark but sure. Okay guys. I'm holding your soul face. There's no space in here. I'm going to show you guys my fit closer up in the mirror. So my dress is from Urban Outfitters. And then my boots are from Steve Madden. I got these necklaces from this shop that I'll link below. I found it on D-Pop. I really love them. This like Dior one and Nike one. And then some earrings which made my ears bleed again. Good morning vlog and welcome to day three of San Francisco. So I'm getting ready for the day. I'm almost ready. Jake isn't. Wait I'll okay. We'll just say something straight. I get last shower priority. Can you put your whole wake up one? I literally woke up at eight today. We're falling apart. You wake up at 9.40 so you're 20. You're ready to see the predictor. It's not 10.00 is it? Yes. Good morning. Good morning. Oh my hair. And it's good. It's like a blinding show. The blinding show is good in here. Why can't that be not seen through so we could get ready. Yeah. I'll say just close my eyes. In the back. In the shower. I'm getting ready. Okay guys we're at breakfast. We were going to go somewhere else but the way it was too long. We chose a restaurant based on Instagram followers because we thought that it was like had more height. And it did. And it did and that was the issue. There were too many people there. So then we came to pizza. It was like so embarrassing. I got a veggie sandwich from here. Got some water. A lot of things on the way. Okay guys so we are now at San Francisco Bridge. Well we're at this like overlook that looks at it and we were just down there taking photos. And I didn't vlog because it was cold. Look you can see it through. Look how pretty it is. It's the bridge. I also feel like now I feel self conscious like vlogging because I bit my lip earlier. We were in pizza and I like bit it and just started gushing blood. Gushing. No it's like. It was like water falling just. Yeah so now when I talk it's like this weird like bump.
