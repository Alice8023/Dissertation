 Hey guys, it's Sid. Welcome back. Today's video is going to be a little bit scary. I am going to be skateboarding today. It is scary because me and skateboard really don't mesh. The year of 2020, can you do some zooms? Sorry. OK. I'll eat. I'm trying to be a good YouTuber. OK, I'm zooming in. The year of 2021 for me is really not trying new things. And OK, so you're zooming a lot. OK, so my new business. Why don't we have someone else with a damn camera? Oh wait, there's no one. Oh, sorry. Oh. Hi. Hi, I'm for Sharma. No, this is not for Sharma. Are we in one of the spots that, like, for a drive-up? Yeah, but it's all right. Oh, I can move for you, Christopher. I don't want to do this. OK, that's a lot. I'm so embarrassed. I'm so... Wake, we're not supposed to be parked here. What the... Hey guys, so we're here at Target. I'm too lazy to walk. I'm so... I'm like we're driving a tangent to our stop. It's just really uncomfortable. I feel like so many people are watching. I feel like I'm going to walk a tangent. So I'm like, I'm going to do my YouTubers. Do they not have skateboards? I feel like now my whole video is ruined. Why did... I can call a friend. I'm serious. A friend? Yeah, do you know Tony Hawk? Shut up. Don't see it. This isn't a part of the script. No. Yo, Tony. Yeah, what's up, dude? Do you want to skate right now with me and my friend? Yeah. Do you have extra skateboards, though, because we can't find any. Yeah, he has plenty. OK, we'll be there in a second. Wait, seriously? Yeah, let's go. Wait, seriously? I'm going to get lessons from the pro. This is amazing. OK, see you guys with Tony. But first... kind of embarrassing. The first start. No, like should I put this in? It's going to look like I have a problem. What are you doing? Tony is coming in handy, I guess. I've never met Tony Hawk. Jake says he's friends with him, so I'm honestly so excited to get lessons from the professional. He's dope. It's going to be your best video to date. I just know. That's embarrassing. Cut the camera. OK guys, so we just got to the house. This is our Tony Luzer. Um... Yeah, I forgot to tell you I don't know. Tony Hawk. I'm Tony Hawk's protégé. So you're really good. Basically second best. How well do you think I'm going to do? Because I've honestly skateboarded maybe once in my life. If you want me to be so transparent, I just don't think you're going to do very well. Yeah, you're going to end up on the floor. OK, we're off the skate park. It's kind of intimate. Woo! Jake, you're interrupting. Can you like not? Oh, not be in it. No, can you like just be silent? That was so mean. I'm ready. I think this is my moment. I think you need to pat up first though. Safety first. Safety first. I think this is for the news. I don't really care. Why are you laughing? Oh, she passed away. Come on. All right, so like safety first and all, but am I going to get hate for taking this off? Should I actually wear this? Yeah, I probably. Yeah, I think I need it. Guys, I'm prepared to eat stuff. I don't swear. I'm so pure. I think this is like a lip. I don't really need the shoulder pads. So that's real though. We're following the WikiHowHow to skate. And the first step is, stand on the board comfortably. Yes. Something like that, side. I didn't see the hope there. Stand on the board. Stand on. She was going, But she's on it. I didn't mean to move. I didn't mean to move. Okay, so I think that one's complete. Woo! 7-2, try pushing off very gently and placing your feet on the board. Do you think you can handle that, sir? Not really. I think these kids are better than me. Okay, you didn't mean to agree with me. That's too bad. So, you alright? Is it okay? Okay, so the first thing you're going to do, you're going to do is you're going to do the front of the board, and then you're going to like gentle push with your back foot, and then step off. Oh, see! That's good! Is that good? Yeah, that's really good. That's really good. That's really good. Okay. Give yourself another push when you slow down. Oh, we like to keep going. Oh, it's like in motion, sir. So, like, so you do the gentle push, and then once you slow down, you do it again. Okay. I'll leave by example. Okay, so you're going to start pushing it when you slow down, you're going to push it again. Wow! Go say it, do it. That was so dramatic. Yay! Check mark! Check mark! Now in this next step, she's going to have to tighten her ankles, put her weight on her toes, so she can turn to the right. Ready? You ready? Not really. Okay, here we go, thanks. Blake's going to do the right way. Blake's going to do the right way. Nice little template. Blake, give her a push. I'm not going that way. You didn't put any weight that way. I'm trying. You're going backwards. You just stood there. Okay, you're going for your weight on your heels. You ready? My heels? Yes, you do. My heels. Yes, you're doing it right now. You're turning. You're turning. That wasn't good, was it? Well, you're barely moving. You're turning. True. You're turning. You're turning. You're turning. That wasn't good, was it? Well, you're barely moving. True. That was good. That was good. I'd say that's a check. Okay, so the next step is to learn how to fall properly. I think this is really valuable information for me to have. I'm probably going to fall. I think you're going to be really good at this one. Can you teach me how to fall properly? I don't fall because I'm Tony Hawk's protege. Okay. I think we all know you're not. Can we turn him off? Blake, why don't you try for us? Yeah. Yeah. I'll watch from behind. Yeah, we'll watch. I don't know how to fall. Okay, just how do you fall? Blake. Is he not being kind of a diva? Yeah, he's kind of being a diva. I thought you were going to teach me. To fall. Blake, I'll do it. Okay. Whoa. I hate that. Ow. How am I doing? You're a mind-structor. I'm doing pretty well for the first time. I see a bright future skateboarding. Thanks. Are you sure about that? I think you're ready. I think this is it. I think it's time I go on the ramps. Honestly, ramps are my biggest fear when it comes to skateboarding because you can't really control your velocity. Your balance can get really thrown off and I've just seen so many people get hurt. Here we go. Alright, let's do it. I don't know about this one. Like, Sid, Sid. What? You're really going to eat it. Oh, god. I just fall. Yeah, let's do a smaller. Blake was really good. I think. Why am I over thinking that? I just do it. Nike says me. Says I should. That was good. Oh my gosh, I did it. I think that was a success. It's a few days later. There's an ice cream shop. That's a few days later. There's an ice cream shop. You good, bro? I'm trying to skate. It was so skate. Yeah. I'm feeling it. It was so good. He wants to hit on his head. So, yeah, I'm going to put my skateboarding practice to the real test. This is the legit skate park now. I honestly don't think I felt this intimidated and quite a while. Oh, I got an escape board. I'm a pro now. Alright. Whoa. I'm going to beat your boss. Can I beat your boss? Bye. Okay. Hey. There you go. Oh, okay. Feel it. What do I even do? This is so dumb. I can't. There's like a little, okay. There's a little drop over there. Oh my gosh, I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm like, five mom. Bye, Tee. Everyone's watching me. Okay. It's because I'm holding a camera. For the YouTube. For the YouTube. Okay. Yay. You like it? Yeah. Yeah. Yay. You like it? Yeah. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. Yeah. I like it. I like it. You're doing great, sweetie. I failed. That was so embarrassing. I feel like I failed some trying again. On this other drop. It doesn't seem as bad. Go sit. Go. If you guys want to see me, I want to show you something. I want to show you something. It's a big one. Oh my gosh. If you guys want to see me really try to get good at skateboarding, like this video, comment down below. Maybe I can try to actually get good lessons. But anyways, thank you guys so much for watching. I hope you liked the video. Sorry, I freaking suck. I tried, but I love you guys. See you soon, bye.
