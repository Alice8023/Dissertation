 It's summer break baby! Hey guys, what's up? It's Sid and welcome back to another vlog. I was editing this vlog and I realized that I feel like it should provide some context. Yes, it is a summer vlog and I was gonna vlog prior my finals and then I realized that would be boring. So instead I thought I would film my first kind of like couple days of summer break. I did a lot of fun stuff with my friends and you guys are gonna see friends specifically as in Jake. Jake isn't this a lot. And no, I'm not dating Jake. I can see the comments coming. Jake is my best friend. I love Jake too bad, but we're not dating. We're like a duo together. So this vlog might be a little overwhelming for you guys. Do you guys like my shirt by the way? It says I love to make boys cry. Anyways, let's get into the vlog. Wait, you can't see me. Can you put me in your head to the shade? Yeah, yeah. It's summer break and I'm here with Jake. We're starting out the first day of summer vacation by going to a little field. Let's pick your time, baby. Okay, I'll get you. And it's like I'm naked. I get pissed when I run out of friends right now. Yeah. Um, they're fine. I don't know if they're the best ever. You told me no, it's good. It's good. It's good. I do. You just run it back. You literally said you were like, you look like a piece of ****. I never said that. You did? Play it back? Do you see that building over there? Home improvement is not the only improvement that needs to be made. You need to prove your own. You're not. You're not. You're not. I'm not. All right, so we're running at this track. This is what we do to cope with our emotions. Actually, it's mostly cities emotions. Yeah, it's actually all right. In a row. Wait, yeah, you can't. You ate. Did you finish this? No. No. Can you just do it? I just wasn't doing it. Yeah, it was not. It was not good. Yeah. What did you say? What time did you decide to everyone this is about? Oh, please. Okay, can you do your heart? Say what? For every 21. This is hilarious, dude. I will take this to my grave. I hope so. Is that my funeral? Did you see the other post with that other? Weird creed? No, something for mentally. What do you mean? What? What? That's... Oh my god. That's the strike. That's insane. It's a nice talented. She's good, huh? Maybe she should wrap her living. She can't eat it up. You guys are never here, but she did a good job. Did me. What do you think? That was pretty...arrow rated. That's my video. So we're swimming right now. I just heard something here. I'm obviously white and blue. Say hi, Jolly. What's going on with us for Jolly? I'm with Jake and Dylan. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to throw the basketball. Go. Ah. Ah. Oh my god. I'm like trying to do it because I have a one that can shoot around here. What happened? I got a little bit of a big one. Yeah. Can you put the voice cap on it? So, like, okay, me and Dylan have a favorite audio. And I'll insert it right here. It's like our inside joke. In three, two, one. Every come. My home. Sweet home. It's like... You make this up here. Really? That's how confident I am. See, I'm going to not make it. Oh! Oh. And I make it from the other end of the pool. Both of your slings right there. That was painful. Yeah. Wow. That was way too much drama. I like taking my home and just yours. My best friend for life. I feel so at home here. Do you? Should I move in? No. You can move out of that side. Do you guys remember when you were younger, when you had a friend over? It was just time for them to go asking your mom. Yeah. And then I would like text her like, Please help me. Pancake time. I know you did not just get on the floor. And back in just for your intro video. I'm stealing. So it's curling royal day. But we're going to go to the thrift store. But I hope it's open. I'm just now realizing like, I'm wearing a royal day. Yeah. I would cry. Would you? I would actually love to see that. Oh, it's actually open. It's really late. This is so you. I think it's cute. Yeah. That's so good. That's the one. What's up, vlog? We bought some stuff. So we got some things. We're going to get them a little tour. I got this tank top. You should micro influence. It's our humor we thought it was fun. Yeah, I thought it was fun. I was trying on two different cronacs. And this one I liked the best because I have so many cronacs but this one is different enough where I can justify it. First of all, I got this hat. The one you tried on earlier. But the thing is it's like, it was $25 for this hat. But it's so cute. You mean that's reasonable? No. I love this hoodie on you. I thought it was... It's so fun. I like myself and green. What do you want to do? Jake took me to his favorite coffee shop. It's like a local coffee shop. It is our second time having coffee today. He's me before my coffee. Yeah, I got me. You got me. Thank you. That was fun. It was really good. Really good. I'm in the middle of the road. I am at the beach. Jake is actually doing like a shoot for a brand with everyone over there. So I'm just here. I'm hanging out. Sometimes I forget that I have access to the beach. Because like, growing up I'm in a soda. I obviously didn't have that. I'm having that. We're talking trash to the vlog. No. I was literally sitting here. I said nothing for a two minute straight. Really? Yeah. You're like nothing. Nothing. Nothing. It's summer break. Thank you.
