 Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching! Yeah, this is getting serious. I even bought the headset. I thought it'd be fun to break out of my comfort zone this week and do something a little bit daring. Uh, I still get video games. I'm probably the worst. A lot of you guys were asking me to play Among Us, which is this new fun trending game. For my first time playing, I thought it'd be fun to play with you guys so you can see me suffer. What's my username? Okay, let's go. Ugh, yeet guys already creeping me out and far away from here. Why is yeet guys still standing there? He is sus to me. Okay, oh my gosh. You guys killed me! No! I knew it was sus! What the heck? It's literally Nelly. I saw the vent. How do you... Oh my gosh, Nelly already killed me. Well, that was fast. I need to change my fit a little. I feel like it could upgrade. Is that a cheesehead? Tiss the season. Why do I feel like I'm running slower this year? I think the pumpkin added a couple of cows. White vented multiple times, right in front of me, LOL. I believe red. Alright, I'm gonna have to go white. Oh my gosh, I'm in pasta! I vent, how do I vent? Like this? I don't want to come out of the vent when they see me. It's too risky. So I'm gonna pretend I'm doing a task and then I'm gonna freaking kill Pigeon and I'll just try to kill now. Kill. I gotta get out. Go! Leave! Why can't I move? Vent. Vent. Vent. Vent. SHOOT! I gotta kill this guy before he sees! Kill! NO! No one is gonna see with me, that was so bad. HAHAHA! Don't say a brown. Everyone's voting for me. Frank! Nothing quite hurts like that does. Why does we not have a cracked egg on his head? How am I going to get a pasta again? Is this game rigged? Okay, I can't complain, honestly. I love being the pasta. Should I vent for fun? SHOOT! I feel like venting is such a risk. What am I doing? That was dumb. There's like nobody around. I swear. Uh oh, sorry, how are you about to go? Gotta dip out, gotta vent. Gotta go. Uh oh. I saw a potato kill. WHAT? We were insecurity and we saw you. HAHAHA! Oh, I'm definitely busted. Wait, what? HAHAHA! Why was white ejected? I don't know how I'm selling this game, honestly. Oh, emergency meeting. I know they saw me vent in the cameras. Dang it! Uh, Sydney, you gotta click-click again. Oh, shoot, sorry. This is a girl. Yeah, I saw a girl. I saw a girl coming up from the bottom of the record. Don't even know, we just saw her go around. Wait, so why do we think it was the girl? We don't, we're just blaming the girl. Oh, they're gonna kill me. Hockey and airy versus us. Okay, stop. You wanna be a little bit more graduate? Laying myself. Just because I've been quiet doesn't mean I'm sus. I've been doing all my tasks. I just finished warming up. I like it, there's something here lying. Something here lying down. Something like a bohockey. I love it. I love airy. Let's just roll it to your left. Okay, so it's Eric or Potato. It's not me, oh my gosh. Why did you- I'm Eric and I'm telling you. I haven't even said anything about the f***ing chick for what? I'm telling you. Ah! It's Potato for sure, Bronch. Covered her own lights. Potato, what's yours, Nora? My story is that I was running trying to do my tasks. What I couldn't find. Can I talk? I swear I'm not the imposter. Don't blow me out, you're gonna regret it. Okay, Potato was in cafeteria. I saw her go towards the bottom section. That was too hot and geared to move. It was an admin. You're scared because I went to the cafeteria. Kind of. Who'd you vote for? Blue. Blue, okay, I'm running for you, yellow. That's sus. We're saying dog is blue. I got proof. Don't you dare say it's me. I swear it's not. I'm gonna be a f***ing devil. I'm a devil. I'm a devil. Guys, we should make like a group chat. We should be friends. No. No. Okay, is this your first time playing Sydney? Yeah. Oh, there's a lot of... Trust me, you'll find a lot of sims on here. Oh f***ing... Oh, f***ing... Oh, f***ing... Devon. Devon, Devon, there's two dead bodies in there, dude. There's black and there's freaking... Oh, my god. There's a mark. I mean, isn't it a devil-cannon? Yeah, but it's Devon! Oh, my god! It's me! Oh, you know what? Good job, bro. We did it. I feel like we're a squad. How about that group chat? No. Stop it. You guys are never an exceeding again after this. It's sad. Yeah, it's the beauty of it. Good. Oh f***ing... I'm gonna go back to my normal life. What? I'm vibing with you guys, though. This could be a girmically thing. Yeah. Hey, you're a good one. Okay, dude. Okay. Okay. Okay. What's all this? It's f***ing blue. I mean, I'm blue. It's a blue. It's a blue. It's a blue. It's a blue. You're a blue. You're a blue. But, you know, you're good, dude. Dude, I saw the dead body, and I was gonna call it... And then why didn't you? Because I was... I ran the run direction. Dude, like, hey. I'm new to this game. I forgot how to use the cursor. You can't pull that card. You're being too... Oh, my god. Check finally left, dude. Oh, you left him, game, bro. I can hear you. Can we please start the group chat, though? Why do you want to know this, you? Why do you want to do it yourself? I want to have fun. How far are you? I just finished that. Me? I'm 20. Oh. You shouldn't have supported me. Yeah, why do you want to say it? Why do you want to make a group chat, man? Because I'm new to the game, and you guys are so fun, eh? I'd love to play with you guys again. We're not fun. You need to be positive. Yeah, you are. We need to be positive, but... We need to be positive.
