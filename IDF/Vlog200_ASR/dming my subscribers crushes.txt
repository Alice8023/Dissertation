 Anyways, ciao. What? What? Hey guys, it's said again. Today's video is gonna be very bold. If you know me at all, you would know I am a matchmaker. I really set everyone up. I bring people together. I'm basically, cupid. Basically, I saw Nicole Raffi do this video where she DMed her subscribers, crushes, and kind of like tried to play matchmaker. So I went on my Instagram story and I asked you guys to send me the username of the person you like. I told you guys I would try to set you up, so... It's pretty simple. The girl said that they have a history. But cut things off, but she still likes him. So I just want to be super chill. Like, how do I just say it? Super chill. Hey there, Isaiah. A little birdie told me that you and Kayla would be cute together. I have to say I agree. Let me know your thoughts to the matchmaker. I think we got it in the bag. Hold up. I gotta reply. I haven't been waiting for this. Alright. Breathe it. Breathe it alone. He replied and he said, I do too smiley face, but I don't think it would be healthy sadly. I feel like that's the most contradicting sentence I've ever read. Is it a yes or no? Alright. Send. I need your moral support. God in this game! I'm in the scream. No need to yell. No need to shout. No need to shout. No need to shout. My friends have joined me. I'm really desperate. That's them. No one's replying to me. One, two, three. However. I was just doing good. Wait, am I allowed to burp? We have to just check up on the one guy. I said is he yes or no? Oh, and he said. I told you I gotta go. Oh, he said no. This is like so hard. I actually feel really freaking bad. I just don't know what to say to her. Oh, he really had to go there. So yeah, it's a no. Hey. That's not the end of that. But we're not giving up just yet. This next person's the girl said. We've been talking a lot recently. He actually lives in a different state. But I really want to make it work. She said the username. Okay, so what? Oh. It's a joke. Oh, it's a joke. Wait, he definitely did it. Take a cow. Okay, she's typing. We, oh, I don't think that's the right one. Oh, yeah. It's her. So she sent the wrong username. We don't want to throw on to the bus. Because now that we know what she isn't playing us. What if we be like, you have a really kind of friend named Madison? Oh, yes. That would be helpful to her. Yeah, we want to help our own allow. Yeah. Kids have to information. You went to it. Yeah. You went to it. You don't get paid enough for this, Sid. I really don't. I'm just out here. I don't get paid anything. Okay. Okay. Oh, guys, he ended up replying a day later. And this is his response. I'd say it's a win. I'd say it's a dub. Regardless, I'm glad we got the right username. And let's move on to the next one. The next girl, she said. So we've been talking and stuff. So you should say something like, hey, you should ask. I'm gonna date or something because I'm pretty sure he likes me back. Just say something about starting to date. Oh, I'm excited to dive right into this. So it has to be date related. Yeah. So, sub-sam. What's the next week for you looking like? Because I'm sure you're gonna be taking. Back for it. Oh, that's it. That's it. Hi, stop hyping me. Oh, my gosh, you're finally useful. What's the next week looking like for you? So I'm pretty sure you're gonna be taking. I'm gonna be on a date. I feel so good about that. Wait, wait, he replied. Damn right. So guys, it was all me. Damn right. I love the confidence. We should get to planning then. Where are you thinking? I can provide recommendations. Yes, I love this guy. You think we need to go on a date? What do you mean, love happens? Oh, what a crazy world we live in. Speaking of crazy, everyone go by Smiles Direct. Hey guys, I wanted to quickly tell you guys about today's sponsor, which is Smiles Direct Club. I'm so excited to be working with them because this is a product I genuinely wish I knew about before I got braces, but I didn't. Instead, I'm gonna tell you guys. Smiles Direct Club is basically a way to straighten your teeth without braces. Smiles Direct Club is very safe. All of the dentists in North Adonis are licensed and you can contact them whenever you want through their telehealth network. So if you have any questions, they're available 24-7. If you want to get started, you can go to one of the 300 Smiles shop locations and book an appointment to have a 3D image taken of your teeth. Or if you want to do what I would probably do, you can have an impression kit sent right to your house. And then once you actually get your aligners every month, you'll just get it shipped to your house. So this is the Smiles Direct Fox. It's super convenient because it's all in this box for you. There's also two treatment options. So if you want to wear them all day long, you can just wear their clear aligners for 22 hours a day. Or if you'd rather do what I would do, you can choose the NCAA option, which you wear at night for only 10 hours. Smiles Direct is so much more affordable than braces. I remember my braces were so freaking expensive. I'm so sorry, mom. If you want to check or if you want to ask your parents if your insurance provider is accepted by Smiles Direct, I'll put the list of them here. I really do. Thanks Smiles Direct to such an awesome option to have. I hope this helps some of you guys out. He replied. Oh my gosh. I'm thinking maybe a day on the lake, swimming, tubing, taking pictures, and have a fire and cuddle up in just straight talk. And then we go out, lay on the boat to watch the stop. What? What? What? What? What? What is Venmo is? And then tell them all Venmo is $10 to buy our ice cream. Oh! Wait, that's perfect though. That's so good. This boy is like gold. Wow, he's swimming, tubing, having a fire, cuddle up straight talk. And then go out on the boat to watch the start? Sam is winning, dude. He is. There's no playing around with this kid. Love your energy, and I already know this day is gonna be one for the books. What if instead of the word B, you did the B emoji? We're so weird, okay, I'm doing that. You won for the bus. Sam, I think you got this one in the bag. Love your energy, and I already know this day is gonna be one for the book. He's so sweet. The effort that he put in. It's his energy. And you can tell he's really thought about it. Here's the prop. Oh! There's a... Why is this taking a turn? Oh! I live almost three hours away. That's an expensive Uber. He's a boat. No, that's just boat trip. Drive your boat trip. Distance can't keep true love. Apart, make you think you guys will be able to see each other. At what, my heart's beating fast. I know, I'm invested. I have no idea. Oh, Sam. They can happen. But. Oh! Oh! Oh! I'm damn sure gonna try. I love it, Sam. Dude. Sam, you're my hero of your watching this man. I think we've done our part. We've done what we can do. We connected them. They know each other like, see each other. Wait, they know what? Ready guys, we have another one. Back to work guys. Hi, Sid. I love your video so much, but I really need your help with the boy. I used to date a boy named Ethan. He was my boyfriend for a year, but he cheated on me. I still have feelings for him, and I want to see if he will give me a second chance. Okay, that's kind of dramatic, but it's kind of... I'm not sick. I mean, try to smash the tour. I mean, part of me is like, let's not get involved, but part of me is like, let's get involved. Hi. I love to help. You don't deserve that. You don't deserve that. Thank you, next. Find a guy who treats you like, like, who you are sent. Well, maybe that will help. Sometimes it's about not finding love, but that's what I'm trying to do. But loving yourself. Anyway. Oh my gosh, you're replying. Honestly, I think you should mind your own business. I appreciate you trying to help, but you don't know my life and what we've been through. He only cheated on me twice. It's so bad. And I believe in second chances. His aunt is... Send him a DM or I'm on phone. I got to go. This is so dramatic. You can find my life motto if you have a problem. Ignore it. This is like gone wrong. Ladies, if you're watching this, don't ever let a man treat you like free salsa. Because you're a guac baby girl. Yes. Don't ever say that again. Okay, but are you just going to hate me on scene? She is now. Does she not understand this is a lot of process? I'm just trying to get all in. I don't even know what to say. I don't even respond. Or we can just be like... We try to help. Sis, you deserve way better. I'm so sorry to hear that. It breaks my heart that anyone would treat you that way. I don't want to DM him. Yeah. It's okay if you don't follow me. I wish you the best. You always got to be the bigger person. You know, you never want to stoop to that level. Don't feed into that drama. Guys, I think we did good today. That was good. Snaps for us. Okay, that was weird. That was very weird. Guys, we did it. I'm just so proud. Thanks, guys. We're healthy. It wasn't on her. We saw it. We came. We conquered. And then there was also this other girl or whoever we did. She's out. She's so far coming. She followed. Thanks for DMing me or crush us on Instagram if you did. Love you guys. And I'll see you next time. Bye. Bye.
