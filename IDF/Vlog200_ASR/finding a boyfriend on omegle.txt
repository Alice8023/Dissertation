Hey, I'm taking a quick little break in this video because I recently got some new phone cases from Case-To-Fy and they just came in the mail and I wanted to show you them and tell you guys a little bit about Case-To-Fy. Since Case-To-Fy is actually sponsoring this video, they have such a variety of cases and I just love that they collaborate with people also. I've collaborated with a lot of celebrities, like Sergisca Parker, The Rolling Stones. There's like a phone case for everyone, and they're also customizable, which is cool. Kastify doesn't only have phone cases, they have a lot of tech accessories and watch bands and air pod cases, but I wanted to quickly show you guys me a drop testing my phone because Kastify does have military drop protection, which is what I need, because I drop my phone every fricking day. So this is one of the phone cases. I just got from Kastify. I also wanna show you guys, I got this super cool, near phone case, which I already smudged. I also got this really cool red one, and this one that says, it's never a bad idea to be kind. All right, I'm gonna show you guys me dropping my phone case, and how it stays intact. Oops. Okay, that's like even a bigger fall than I expected, but let's take a look. We can see the phone is still intact, and the case is also like perfect. I really love them, and I feel like you guys will too. They're so fricking cute. Like how cute is this phone case?
