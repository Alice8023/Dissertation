 Woo! What Friday be like? What? [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ Hi guys, what's up? So, Alexa and I are both with wife and our families. So, we're kind of having little friends giving. We like to go black Friday shopping. So, it's currently 504. Target opened four minutes ago. Oh, I'm gonna, it's for a little late. We're gonna have to follow the deals. You just have to get the mentality from black Friday. There's like a certain mentality, which is how to be in the zone. True, I feel. Ready for black Friday! Peace. Hey guys, so, we're at the mall. It's literally dead. Like, actually, no one's dead. In the black Friday spirit. I'm gonna start at his clothes. What the? Bam, confused. Okay. Black Friday gone wrong. Wait, look, there's a sign. Black Friday in line starts on gallery way. Mall doors will open at 6 p.m. We have 40 minutes. Oh my gosh, I'm really disappointed. I don't know what we're gonna do, to be honest. We'll just see what happens. Bon appétit. Hey girl, I love millones. It hasn't even stopped working in a hotel. Look. We've got a lot of 보� thoughts around, and I'll just find out sign once I do that it's not, it's sometimes like, just hard to understand. We'll try to be pretty. Here is a sign for Billy to remember. and they're open and there's all these people in here. Target one. First things first, we need Christmas pajamas. It's a little small. I would have to say on this. Nadi. Oh, oh my gosh. Oh my god, this is the funniest target trip of my life. Wait, what? A bro? Oh no, no. That's a Rudolph. So this is where we're at. Actually, you know who might like that? I don't know. This is our life right now. Well, so far, Target has a really good selection of plush animals, but I don't think that's how we need. Guys, we found the best black Friday's deal in the whole store. Go get you some cereal right now, because you're gonna sell out. I'm surprised no one else is in this aisle. Sugar cookie toast crunch limited edition and it's 49 cents off. Nice. This is not a drill. That was so dramatic. It's just so. So update, so far. We have cookies and milk. So black Friday is getting pretty crazy. Actually though, this is like kind of not embarrassing. I don't know, it's weird. Like just to be honest, I really need to send that to a little bigger one. I need some of the paper. You know, most people on black Friday are getting TVs and like computers, but you know, we have other priorities. Okay, also could use some paper towels. Yeah, priority. Okay, okay. I think we did good at Target. Wouldn't you say? Yeah, I agree. Okay, so we are now back from shopping. There were not like a ton of stores open tonight. A lot of the stores aren't open till tomorrow. Right now, we're super hungry. So we're making pasta. And we're also about to change into our cute Christmas pajamas that we got. So cute. So cute. We got these. They were actually a buy one, get one free at Victoria's Secret. Girls might be like, they accidentally left the sensor. Yeah, of course this would happen. Like, I don't know how I'm gonna get this off. This is how you make cookies the right way. The first you take the store box, no. And then, okay, why are they like, I don't know, bro. Wait, were these in your fridge already? Yeah. Oh, I thought you bought them and they were like missing. I was like, that's right. You take the dough, right? Put them on the tray, like so. Okay, that was so aggressive. It's been a long day, guys. I don't know why, black Friday shopping is so tiring. I agree. Look at this angel. Oh. Ooh, it's good. It's not fully cooked, but I guess it makes it better. Oh, it's not. They're not cooked, but. They're definitely not. What is in these, really? So many say it's an accident. I say it's a beautiful mistake. Why did I just say that? Like, why is it wrong? It's literally wrong. Guys, we are so weird together. Like, if you want to, if you want to, if you want to, if you want to, if you want to, if you want to, if you want to, if you want to, if you want to, if you want to, Hey guys, so it is now the next morning. Today is now actually technically black Friday. Last night, there actually wasn't a ton of stores open. It is currently actually 10.30. So it's not even like super early. I didn't really want to get up. I think that early. I just, I wanted to sleep in. I know we for sure want to go to bath and body work. That's like my favorite store ever for black Friday. So yeah, we're going to go there. There's also a few other stores in the mall that we're probably going to go to. It's time to get my gameplay song. All right, let's go. Okay. Okay, so I got back from Black Friday shopping. It is actually now two o'clock. I really didn't go as intense this year. This year I just wanted to kind of chill. I didn't want it to be like two intense. Let's just start out at Forever 21. They were doing the 30% off the whole store. The first thing that I got is this super cute sweater. It's just this chunky, cable knit sweater. I just love the colors in this. I think this is so cute. I saw this from across the store and it just jumped out at me. I also picked up another sweater from there. And this one is very long. I definitely think it's supposed to be oversized because this is a small and it's pretty long on me. I'm also short. But I like it because it is pretty like wide neck. So I think it will go off the shoulders, which I love off the shoulder stuff. I also, oh my gosh, I forgot I got this. I used to wear a ton of Hebans when I was younger. And I don't know why I just saw this and I thought it was so cute. It's just this little pearl Hebans. I feel like I've been seeing a lot of these. I think it's just so cute. I think it'll be super cute on. I also got, I got this Hebans. It has little gift wrap bows on it. There's like really no occasion for me to wear this. To be honest, I thought it was cool. So that's all that matters. Oh, I did also pick up some really cute mittens from there. These are cable knit and I think they're so cute. I'm gonna be going back to Minnesota for Christmas. So these will come in handy. I thought I would pick up this eye mask. It's actually kind of cute, but I'm pretty sure you're just supposed to put these in the fridge. I mean, you could do the freezer, but you don't wanna like freeze your eyeballs off. So I'm probably just gonna stick these in my fridge and just put them over my eyes. I feel like it will just be nice to like cool down and deep puff my eyes. They also got me right as I was about to check out with the nerd rope. Why did I get this? I got these socks. They say it's natural problem. So enough said. The last thing I got, I think this is the cutest top ever. When I was with Alexa, I saw this and she was like, that's so your style. It's this super pretty top. It's ruffled and it has little sparkles on it. I just think this is so dainty. I seriously love this. Obviously, it is see-through. So I got this little tan tank top that I can wear underneath it. Also last night, I did go to Target as you guys saw. I mean, there's really nothing. Nothing interesting. I got paper towels and toilet paper. I also got this drink. This really makes no sense. I'm glad for it at home. But this is seriously my favorite drink right now. You guys should all try it. It's called the Rebel Chocolate Immunity Something. It just tastes really good and it's also kind of healthy. That's pretty much all I got from Target. As you guys know, we went to pink. Actually, it was technically Victoria's secret that we went to and I got this super cute pajamas set from them. As you already saw, I wore this last night, but it's so cute, so comfy. The only thing is that they left the sensor on. So the first half we made today was Bath and Body Works. Bath and Body Works is my favorite place to go black Friday shopping. I am just obsessed with all of their stuff, especially their candles. Every year, I always stock up on Christmas candles. They had it where it was by three, get three free. Also, I made the mistake again. Every year, I tell myself I'm not gonna do this, but I forgot and I went to Bath and Body Works first, which is a rookie mistake. Don't do that if you wanna get candles. Cause then you're gonna have to love this around the whole time you're shopping. I got six candles. I'm gonna tell you guys all the sense I got. Winter candy apples, the first one. Also got vanilla bean noelle. I also got cinnamon spiced vanilla. I also got twisted peppermint. I feel like this is such a classic. And then I got the Mary Cookie. And then the last one that I got is rose water and ivy. I feel like this would be like a good bathroom candle. So the last place we went to was Paxon. Honestly, I feel like Paxon was the craziest store that we went to. But the first thing that I got is this Kruneck. I love this. If you can see, it's just a very beachy Kruneck. I got it in a medium. I usually like two size up with my Kruneck's because I really like them to be oversized. And it's just super comfy and cozy. I feel like it's actually a very visco-y. The D-Loth Paxon was by one, get one 50% off. So the next thing I got is this super cute top. I know I feel like I own so many shirts, but I really don't feel like I have anything similar to this. It's just this off-green long sleeve top and has the little blue flower pattern on it. I just love it. I really love especially the ruffle trim on it. I also saw this top and this is just a pretty basic purple top. I really love when tops are like cinched here. And then it also has this little lace on the front of it. So I got those two tops and the last thing I got from Paxon, I saw this hat and I thought it was so cute. It is just this friend's beanie. I just think this is the cutest thing ever. I am obsessed with it. I should put it on right now. Is this not the cutest hat you've ever seen? But yeah, that is everything that I got for my black Friday haul. But I just wanted to say I hope you guys had a great Thanksgiving. I am so grateful for you guys. And I just wanted to let you guys know how thankful I am for you. But I love you guys. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in my next video. Bye guys.
