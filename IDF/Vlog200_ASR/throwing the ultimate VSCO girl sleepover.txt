 Boo! Wow it's thin, and it hit one! This girl's too nice! I don't know what that was Hello guys, what's up? Oh, you slam that. So sorry. So today I'm here with my friend. Yeah! So many friends. So many friends. No? Yes. I thought it was super fun to have a visco girl sleep over. Because if you guys didn't know, I did a visco girl video where I transformed into a visco girl. And I just wanted to see her fun to do a sleep over version. Oh yeah, baby. I have a visco girl. I have girls just going to have fun. Woo! I'm happy, right? If you guys don't know, what a visco girl is. Basically, it's like a very like Tumblr aesthetic girl. There's this app called Visco. And there are these girls on the app who are very like Tumblr and aesthetic. So we thought we would have like a little sleep over where we are very like aesthetic. And we do aesthetic fun Tumblr things. I have some like fun stuff I have to do. Oh, activities. What's our eighth diary? Step one is to make a fort. OK. Save fort. 10 homes pass. Fort fort fort night. Fort fort fort fort fort fort fort fort fort fort fort fort. What are you eating soup with? It's worth more. It's worth more. It's worth the food. Ha ha! Ah! You got me there. It's from Jake and Josh. You're too young to be my friend. It's Jake and Josh. Wow, you are too young to be my friend. I'm sure he knows Josh. I'm like the... Hey. By the way, Paul, everyone. I'll put all their links below. OK, like guys, let's go on... F... F... This girl sees it on three. OK. Also, a lot of words. One, two, three, Let's go girl see that! Am I sound a little crazy, but I was thinking we could like tilt my couch over and like put it like vertical? I feel like I just realized I'm very visco-y right now with my seat. Wow, I'm in the spirit. Yeah. We're having a little problem right now, band-aid time. I had a casual tea with my first one minute. Visco girls are like everyone else. They get, they get, I don't know what I'm saying, they need band-aids. Builder Sydney. Got the builder, who? Um, help. You can't do it. This is kind of heavy. Someone helps. This is so skinny. Like, who fits in? Don't worry. So we're building a fort, but we're not going inside of the fort. Make it like a TV. Yeah. Okay, so I wanted to show you guys what happens next and like, slow it down because it's so funny. So Lexi's just walking around and she decides to stick a plant in the middle of the fort. I don't know why she did this, but then we resume and keep doing our normal things. We did it realize that it was sitting there for like five minutes and then all of a sudden we noticed the plant. Can your audience even vote for this one? I'm really angry. Don't know why I just really wanted to voice this over because I thought it was really funny. Maybe I'm the only one that thinks it's funny. Okay, anyways. Okay guys, so we've built our fort. We've been talking just like girls. It's just like boys, strap, throw. It's an essential part to a girl's night in my opinion. It's making it too shy. Hi. I can't see. Okay. I don't know. Okay. Okay. We just finished building the fort and we hung out in it for actually a little while. Wasn't it fun guys? It was so fun. So now is the time we have to take down the fort because we still have some other disco girl activities. Right. Lexi? Girl activities. We're going to be tired. Being a disco girl is really hard work. Now it's time to clean up and we're going to play Twister and do face masks. So let's get rid of the fort. I'm kind of sad that we're destroying it but it has to be done. We're doing face masks and this is our collection. We have coconut cream and avocado clay. Lexi can't do a face mask right now because she got facial but we wish she was here. You know what is ASMR. I'm not sure I'm the part of this. Okay that's not worth it. Oh. It smells good. Oh. Should I use my hand? No. What do you want? Twister. I'd sleep over as I feel like there's like a point in the night where everyone gets really tired and that's us right now. But we should re-energize ourselves. Twister. Right foot red. Right foot red. No, no. You don't all do the same one. You pass it around. Oh. Oh my god. Help me. Okay guys. So we finished the face mask. Twister kind of like went wrong. He's not going to stay gone around. How basically would you rate this night? I would say it at 9. 9. I would say like a solid like 9.75. Oh. Oh. Okay. Thank you guys for watching this video.
