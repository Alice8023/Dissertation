 I remember being bored of the week. Good morning vlog and welcome back. Today is preparation for vacation day. I'm so excited because tomorrow I leave for a river with some of my best friends. We've been planning this trip for so long so I'm obviously going to prep for my trip today and I'm going to show how I'm getting ready and then I'm going to vlog obviously once I get there. So it's kind of like a two-and-one for you guys. My mom is spamming me. The first thing I'm doing is getting my nails done because they are horrendous. I haven't had them filled in probably a month. So let's go. Hi! I love my nails, you guys. I think they're so fun. I had decided to see a French but instead of the classic French I got multi-color French. I just can't stop looking at them. I feel like I had to get that out of the way because anything else I was doing my nails were just interfering because they were so grown out. I'm going to go home and start packing. Why is it that the night before I leave is so stressful. I do think that it says something about me. I left everything to the last minute. It's currently 10.50pm and I laid out all of my stuff to pack. I also cleaned my room while I was at it because it desperately needed to be cleaned. I'm also uploading a vlog at the same time that I'm filming this. And I'm trying to pack less lately. I'm trying not to over pack. It's a little hard for me. My dad also was so lovely and got me a neck pillow which I will be needing because I have to wake up here at 3.45 am. Which is literally in like 4 hours. I'm bringing two swimsuits. I feel like that's enough. You alright? I think I'm going to bring this white dress. It's new and beginning to take actually send it to me. So my bag is packed. That didn't even take very long honestly. What helps me the most packing is rolling things. It just saves so much space. I'm ready to go. And I got a bed. See you guys at 3 am. It's 3.51 am. You slept for so long. What do you mean? Oh I did so for like 10 hours. Yeah! Good morning guys! We got two rubas. So okay I'm sorry. Good morning. Good morning. We are in a ruba. And I'm with Mia. My roommate for the weekend. We're all here with Jake and Sophie. We are. You guys know that. Yeah, there's another room. Okay can we do a tour? Yeah. Oh hey guys. Welcome in. Sorry all of our bathroom. We've already made ourselves comfortable. We have our stuff laid out. It's like all my stuff. So we tell them what happened in here this morning. I think we better not. Got the camera. We decided to get two beds. And here's why. We cannot sleep in the same bed. And the best part is our view. This view right here. Oh! Mia Mia Mia Mia! Oh my gosh you know. Oh my gosh stop. Six. Stop. We're here at Jake and Sophie's door. Because they're our neighbor. I'll do the honors. Oh no! Good morning everyone. I'm so happy. Good morning. You were quite a bit of sleeper today. You said good morning. It's 11.50. Guys I slept in, okay I'm sorry. It's not happening until it's really. It's really? Could you just do it? Wait is this? Wait. Okay. Okay guys. So I'm back in the room now. I slept in much later than all of my friends. They all kind of already got ready. So I'm gonna get ready now. First things first. Obviously sunscreen. This is the glow screen. And I use this every day. You guys know this by now. I love it. Also guys I love my swimsuit. I just need to show you. I got this from Motel Rocks. This is like the one thing I like to do every day. Even if I wear no makeup, I just like to cover my under eyes. Which I know a lot of this will come off. I also miss breakfast this morning because I slept in. And I'm so hungry. So after this I think I'm gonna go get breakfast. Like we have a group chat and it's just like, didn't see until I woke up. Everyone's like, okay we're meeting to get breakfast. And then I just didn't. I just didn't go. Oopsies. I like to set my glow screen because I feel like it kind of moves around this job. I'm gonna do a touch of blush. There we go. Voila. Okay we're all ready to go. I think. Should I put some jewelry? Oh. Before I leave. And to figure out which sunglasses to wear. These ones. Actually they're both. Neither of them are mine. Do I wear these from Nia? These are massive but they're so fun. Like I love them. These are massive but they're so fun. Like I like that they're so large. Okay. Before I can wear these. Ooh. I kind of like these. I think I'm gonna go with these. Okay. Let's go get some breakfast together. Better late than never. Okay guys we got our food. This is my lunch slash breakfast. We got chicken tunders, fries. I don't think they fit in the vlog yet. Say hi. Hi guys. I don't think I was in the background. Oh you're in the bathroom. This is Sophie. Hello guys. I'm Sophie. I said, I love you. I see. I'm taking a break. I was swimming for like an hour or so. And now I'm reading. This book is called Atomic Habits and I read it once a while ago. And I said this is a type of book that's good to get a refresh. It's definitely one of my favorite books. I really recommend it. Sophie and I are on food duty. We're gonna go pick up snacks for us. We're getting cheese burgers for Jake and Nia and fries. The bartender said he made something special for us. We just got back from the beach. We have dinner reservations in like two hours. So I thought I would just start to get ready. Might as well. I decided that for dinner I wear this beautiful brown dress that I got. Actually, if you guys watched my New York vlog then you would have seen me buy this there. We're going to this Italian place for dinner tonight. I didn't vlog this because I couldn't but we went to eat today and it was so much fun. It was all for us on one two. It was one of the most fun things I've done in a while. Except for how much fell off. You good? Yeah, I'm just finishing getting ready. I'm vlogging. Good, come in. Look at her. Did I record? Oh my god. I'm vlogging. Come. What's your fee for usage? What you charge? I charge for you. Wow, I kind of look so beautiful. I love you. What's our last night? Things were crazy. There were these kids that we met and they were kind of crazy. And they were just listening. I think. Anything. Can you cut this please? Cool. Thank you. It's hot. Wait, I'm not her. Give me a hug. Oh, that was good. Why am I good at singing? Why do I have so many talent? Oh. See you at dinner. Bye. Hey guys, we are at dinner. I got a Caesar salad as my appetizer. Fun fact about me. I love red wine. Did you guys know that? I knew you'd like wine. I didn't know what red wine you liked. Our main course came. I got lasagna. It's dessert time. Mansofie are splitting a chocolate almond cake. It's chires. Here's a thigh. You're going to feed it. Should we? Should we? We decided to go on a little night swim. Should we go to have a sweet chat? It's a little damp. What are you doing? I don't know. Should I scare them? So you can come. Oh. I'm scared. Is dinner coming out? It's really? Really? Yeah. Really? Yeah. I feel like you saw right through me. No, I don't see anything. It looks like we're in contact. Okay, hold on. What is this place? Oh wait. It's called Daddy. Hey, Lucie Rooba. Okay. I guess I'll stand mine up too. I'm going to have a candy cane. Hi. I just did my skincare. I'm ready for bed now. Honestly, the only reason I'm ending this vlog is because I heard Nia ending hers. And I was like, wait. I shouldn't mind. I'm so bad at ending my outro's. Anyways, love you guys. Thanks for watching and I'll see you in my video next Sunday. Bye guys. Bye.
