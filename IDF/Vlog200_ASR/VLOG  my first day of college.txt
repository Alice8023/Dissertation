 Good morning you guys welcome back. First your class start on. Hey guys it's said. Today is my first day of in person college ever. I'm at junior in college now. I woke up like five minutes ago and then it literally feels like I'm going back to high school. Even though I'm not you couldn't pay me enough to go back to high school. Okay the first thing is first. Shower. Okay I look busted right now but when I said oh my outfit's last night I didn't I didn't really. I'm a decisive. So I don't know what I want to wear today. I said both these out last night just because I couldn't decide and I felt like for some reason in the morning I would be able to decide. I really like this because I feel like this is really cute for like the first day of school, the card again, the button up. But then I also have this scored with that white shirt. I think I'm going to do this because I didn't self-taim my legs. Okay. It's exposing me. You know when you have those pimples that hurt before they're even visible on your skin. And literally however, right here it hurts so bad bro. I was of low pain tolerance so. Hey guys, I'm at school. I made a friend. What do we've already been friends so that's so big of me. I'm like the YouTuber at school. We're walking to the gas. Are we? Yes. We're hungry. Pass was good. I do feel weird vlogging in public. I'm getting like PTSD from high school. Guys, I got water. I got water too. I got fucking vlogging. I hate it. Okay guys, it's now 12.30. First two classes are done. I'm having a snack because I'm hungry. And I didn't think ahead and I didn't bring food. So that's only me. So we went to Starbucks. Got some egg white bites. I'm waiting for my next class. We're starting like 30 minutes. What do I'm? I feel like I'm having a snack. I just met him. This is so cute. Campus is so pretty. It's also so busy right now. It's so intense. I don't know this. Little nervous. I'm so nervous. This is my debut year panel. Oh my god. This is awesome. It's really pretty. I'm in my next class. And I just met this new girl. Her name's Maddie. Wait, were you in my bathroom? Wait, were you in my bathroom before? First day is... That was really amazing. As I was saying, first day complete. I think it went so well. So I'm now out of class. Class got out like literally 20 minutes. No, I got out like an hour ago. I don't know. I just said that. I'm going to get my way to get lunch actually with one of my friends. Mia's been in like a couple of my vlogs. And it's Mia's brother. Will. So Will's new to Chapman. And I was like, Will, we have to like get food or something. Because Will is the best ever. He's so fun. I feel like I'm also new to Chapman because last year was all online. So it's like we're kind of in it together. Woooow! Woooow! What's up? I'm vlogging. Woooow! Woooow! Woooow! Woooow! Woooow! Oh, you want me to vlog? Show me that. Is it so good? Yeah. Well, it's like 12 out of 10 material. So that was how my first day of school went. I would say it went pretty well. Then a few days later, me and my friends decided to go to the sand dunes. Which was so much fun and I vlogged it. So yeah, this is a celebrating like our first week of school being done by going to the dunes. Guys, we're going to the sand dunes! Woooow! Oh, I thought I'd drive. Oh no. They will literally report you the highest sense of love. So let's get around to pause for a second. Woooow! Woooow! Woooow! They're at me at what you narrate my vlog. Like if you said if you needed, it would make sure like I got you. Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. It's said and today I'm here with my friends. Look, I don't need to tell you what to do. She's not in the sand dunes. I'm so sorry. Okay, let me try to come do it. Okay, fine. It goes like this. Stop saying, don't tell me. I don't want to video what you're saying. Stop! I want to say something like that. I don't want to. Sit. What were you going to say? I think you didn't do it. Thank you. Hey guys, it's said and today I'm with my friends and we are going to the sand dunes. Woooow! Get some lawn trying to see. The viewers just stuck up the first ones. This is really dramatic right now. Okay, I think my channel isn't dramatic. And that's the point I'm trying to get across. Is it a rock? She got to be with problematic ice. Where is it? I don't really know. We're usually not. It's now 340ish and we are headed to the dunes which are still two hours and 56 minutes away. I'm done. So I got a question for you guys. Hi Apple and pizza. Well, I'm not really. No. I think it's like for sure. Please back me up in the comments. This is very necessary. Are you sad? I am. I am a little sad. Oh, sorry. Good night. All right, Peter. Yay! Oh, man. What? Wait. Being good. I'm a bad. The judge above it's bump. Oh. So. I'm not. I'm not. I don't like jokes. We support you. Okay. I like ë‹¬my like the rose. Yeah. Except for the rose. Alright we were about to drive home and then Jake saw this. And he had to stop. How much would I have to pay you to eat those Doritos? You know those Doritos do look scrumptious. But do they though? Low bar again about 2 mil. I can't afford that. Jake! I can't afford to pay you to eat those. Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake I was literally kidding. Wait! No! What are you doing? Jake! What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Jake! Jake! Jake I was literally joking! What are you doing? I was just discussing! You were joking! You were joking! You were joking! You were so afraid! It's now 2 hours later. And last is Mexican restaurants. I'm with the boys. Chicken tacos. Okay. Oh for me. Thank you. This looks really good. That's good. Good job. Good job. Good job. Longing log. Longing log. Yeah. We are done with the dunes. We doomed out of there. Let's just say we doomed our last dunes. So let's talk about that scent. We drove past this like cow farm. Oh my god. The scent was really awesome. I would say like cow smell of fat. Like in my knowledge of hatred. A legal? Pain is just what not right now. Nasty disrespectful. You heard fool. And you know what I learned today? No lies on the jerky. Just the ambidest station. I think like Pippos been there doing that. Oh my god. That was good. That was amazing. That was awesome. That was the best shirt you can get. Turn it off.
