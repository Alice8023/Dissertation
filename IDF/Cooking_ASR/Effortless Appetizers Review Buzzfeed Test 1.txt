 What's going on guys, David here and welcome back to this week's video now Buzzfeed everyone on YouTube knows about them either your love them or you hate them Personally, I've been obsessed with their stuff for the past few months and I'm pretty sure their videos are more dicking than Most illegal narcotics if you watch their videos regularly You would know that every couple days they upload a food related video whether it be this new dessert they created or drink or appetizer or anything and then you always tend to see comments like this one that and Yeah, and I will admit even though I do like their videos sometimes I'm a little skeptical of some of this stuff too But have no fear because from this day forward every Thursday I will be taking one of your suggestions and Trying to recreate it. I'm gonna follow their video step by step and I'm gonna judge it on how long it took How easy it was to make and if it's actually even good for this week's video I decided to choose the potato chip and onion lotus appetizers Man because I already have this stuff and I can't imagine that a straight-up baked onion would taste good So let's get started. Things you're going to need to make these are Potatoes and onions of course salt and pepper butter oil and balsamic vinegar Now let's first wash these potatoes even though Buzzfeed is apparently not worried about cleanliness Now since these are smaller potatoes, I'm gonna experiment a little bit This one I'm gonna cut a little thicker and then this one I'm gonna cut nice and thin like they did in the video Then grab a cookie-try-covered foil throw those things on there now We're gonna take a couple teaspoons of butter and boom melt that right up Just a little bit all over the top of the potatoes add a little salt a little pepper and Into the oven they go for one hour on 425 degrees now Let's get to the onions. I don't think they want you to peel them So let's cut the top off the bottom off and then we're gonna do four cuts right down the middle, but don't cut all the way through Just like that. Oh now you want me to take this skin off awesome and For experimental sake, I'm gonna do one white onion and one red just to see which one comes out better You're gonna drizzle some olive oil Then some balsamic vinegar And like the other one just some salt and pepper Cover it up with tin foil and throw that one right in there and next to the potatoes You're gonna leave those in there for 25 minutes and then after that take the tin foil off and leave them in there for 10 more minutes Now let's take these right out of here. So apparently these guys just need a little more salt and A little more balsamic That's a lot those look a lot better now those Don't look nearly as good as these neither one of them looked up it Let's try one of these don't really want to but the sake of this video Now Either I undercooked these or it's something wrong. I mean, it's like bra onion Now I saved these because I'm much more excited about these These are winners things I gotta say about this number one Definitely don't undercook these leaping for the full hour because they need it number two Call them thinner say come out better. All right, so final review how easy it was to make them they're pretty easy It took me about 15 20 minutes to cut it and get a little prepared. It does take an hour in the oven But good little bit taste these things are awesome the onions you kind of got a love for all onions So overall I'll give these a eight out of 10 and the onions are six out of 10 if you like the video guys Please give me that big thumbs up It would mean a lot if you have a suggestion for a video that I should try next leave it down in the comments Because I'm gonna need another one to do other than that guys having also weak and I'll see you right back here on Sunday Peace
