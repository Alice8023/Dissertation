 What's going on my peeps my name is David and welcome back to BuzzFeed Test number 37 I believe the fact that we've been now doing this for 37 weeks straight with how failed blows my mind and I know a ton of you guys really really want me to start the DIY series on Sundays and Honestly, I've been trying I just haven't had the time to get two videos out of week within the next month though I promise I'll get you one anyways Let's get into this week's recipe this one's kind of an old school one and H dot TXX has been suggesting it on every single video for months as well as all the other people I'm showing you here Pigs in a pretzel blanket at first glance This one seems like it might be on the simpler side, but whenever I say that I tend to have a hard time with it So let's get right into it So guys for this week's recipe you're only gonna need a few main ingredients Which are some baking soda some pizza dough a couple cups of water some miniature beef rinds or cocktail weenies Some coarse sea salt and in egg and let's begin this process by first tackling our dough So if it yours is refrigerated I highly recommend that you leave it out for 10 to 15 minutes Well, it's gonna be super cold and difficult to work with as you can see here at first I had a little bit of a difficult time rolling them out and then throwing a hot dog and rolling them up nice and even But eventually I got the hang of it and just pumped all of them out until I didn't have any more dough You just want to make all of these as uniform as possible So when you throw them in the oven they have somewhat of a close cooking time But before they go in the oven you have to grab yourself a saucepan with five cups of water Allow that get to a boil like this at which point add a quarter cup of baking soda Stir until the water gets clear again and now your water is ready to blanch these So a couple at a time I threw them in the water and only leave them in for about 30 seconds until they get somewhat of a coating Around the dough you don't want to overcook these trust me when I tell you I used a stopwatch on my phone to get as close to 30 seconds as possible for all of these some batches I did two at a time some I did three and then once they are all done You're gonna throw them onto a cookie sheet like so the next step is to make yourself an egg wash So in a little cup crack an egg and whisk that up then lightly brush some of the egg onto each and every one of your little hot dogs And finally we can throw these into a 425 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes in the meantime I'm gonna whip myself up a quick little nacho cheese sauce So in a different pan I threw in some butter some flour let that cook down for a little bit Then a cup of milk let that cook down and then throw in a couple handfuls of cheddar cheese until it gets nice and thick like this But finally after 15 minutes I took these things out of the oven and bang Look at these gorgeous glistening nuggets of deliciousness either these recipes are getting easier or I'm getting a little better at cooking It's probably just recipes So as far as appearance, I mean you can't get much better than this nicely browned on the top It's got a nice like pretzel-esque coating the fresh cracks. You saw on top So I do have some high hopes for this get some of our cheese sauce on this bad boy. Oh I'm very pleasantly surprised at how much this actually tastes like a pretzel that crispy coating on the outside is Delicious with the salt the cheese is a good addition my only issue which is probably my fault is inside it's like On the raw side Melissa It's a little doughy so maybe the dough wasn't room temperature when I first rolled it out or I didn't cook it for long enough But it is a little up on the doughy chewy gummy side It still tastes great. So if any of you guys are planning on making this let your dough get down a room temperature And rise a little bit before you chop it all up and you might want to cook it for a couple minutes longer But other than that, this is a pretty good recipe. I'll give it a 8 out of 10 Hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did smash a like on this one forming I know a lot of you guys are new around here So if you are and you haven't yet hit that subscribe button right under this video So you don't miss my future ones and also for everyone I have a second channel that I've been posting vlogs on every couple days or so So I'll link that in the top line of the description if you want to go check those out as well As always you can always hit me up on Twitter or Instagram with recipes that you want me to try And other than that, have an absolutely awesome rest of your week.
