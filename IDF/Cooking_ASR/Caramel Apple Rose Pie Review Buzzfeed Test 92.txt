 What's going on my peeps welcome back to a brand new BuzzFeed test. Now this one has come very highly requested by all of you people. Thank you for those and it's not like I've been putting it off or ignoring it. I've just had it in the schedule. Try to get some structure in this hectic month and we still got three weeks left so it won't be over anytime soon. But today we're going to be trying out the caramel apple rose tart pie. What do you call this thing? I don't know and let's be honest all of us here have been around long enough to know that this little three-second clip of them layering all the apples like this so perfectly and can it be that quick. So let's timidly jump right into this one. Before we begin quick shout out to my beautiful grandma for letting me use her kitchen and get it all filthy and gross mine was just in shambles the other day so thank you I love you. But let us begin now unlike in tasty's video I'm going to make some homemade pie crust and I'm going to use the very same recipe from Katie Perry's cherry pie because that thing came out amazing. I started with two and a half cups of unbleached flour. I then took two and a half sticks of unsalted butter and chopped them up into cubes again I know this is a ton of butter but that's really the only two or three ingredients in this pie crust. So I kind of crumpled that together and I learned the last time that you want to actually keep your butter pretty cold during this process because on top of this you're going to add in some ice cold water. Apparently this will allow some of that butter to remain intact until it bakes and it allows that crust to become flaky. I don't know that's just what I've been told so moving right along I took that giant mass of dough I kind of rolled it out onto the counter and kneaded it a bit separated it into two halves rolled both of those out a bit. Layered them together wrapped that whole thing in plastic wrap and you have to let this set in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. We can now begin to work on the star of the show hour apples. I had a variety of different ones I think one of them was honey crisp golden delicious and Fiji I had a few different ones and I peeled them up with this nifty contraption I guess only grimm our things and once those were all peeled I chopped them up and tried to make some even slices with these I'm not sure exactly how thin to go on these I kind of just made a guess but I did try to get them all to the same size so they cooked at the same length of time so I just tossed those all into a bowl and set it off to the side for now and worked on my sugar mix that is going to coat all of these apples a half cup of white sugar half cup of light brown sugar a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon and then a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg pretty simple stuff sprinkle that over top of all your apples give them a nice thorough toss and you want to let these sit and sweat out those juices for again another 30 minutes now while I let those apples rest I grabbed my dough back out of the fridge and gave it a few minutes at room temperature so it's a little bit easier to work with and then started to roll it out nice and thin tried to very carefully roll it off of the counter and then flip it onto my cast iron sorry if you couldn't see that it was a little bit difficult maneuvering here unfortunately clearly I cut off too much of the dough so I had to cut and roll a whole new piece and stick it in that empty space there and once I kind of mashed the two together it looked like this might work so I then just took a fork and stuck a bunch of holes in the bottom of this I still just say this day don't know what this is for so if you know let me know in the comments but now we can begin to shovel out our apples out of that juice you can see how much liquid it came out of these things and slowly one by one throw in our apple slices into this massive cast iron skillet now you can see what I was talking about this is going to take me all day and side note I had to skin and slice up two additional apples for this so I think I use seven in total so once I filled up the entire pie crust with our apples you want to cover it with some tin foil throw it into your oven for 30 minutes at 375 then you want to take your foil off and leave it in at the same temperature for another 10 minutes and while it's finishing up on our stove top you want to dump in your juice from your apples let that reduce by about half and then add in a quarter cup of heavy cream I think I might have added this in a bit too early I did seem a bit too liquidy when I did that unfortunately but I let it reduce a bit more and I'm hoping that when it sets and cools down it'll thicken up a bit but we'll see so I took our pie out of the oven and I'm not too mad at how this is looking shockingly all the apples stayed in their places and kind of held that rose form so once it cooled down I just drizzled my caramel over top and I tried to cut a piece I think this was still too hot because this was very difficult but I eventually got one so let's give it a taste that's good now this is actually a whole new piece that I just cut from the one I just showed you on camera that's why it's still intact so well the apples actually seem really well cooked which is crucial in a proper apple pie cheers boys and girls in celebration of the fall oh my gosh the apples still do hold a bit of a crunch so if you like really soft mushy apples you probably I'll even oven for a bit longer but the taste is phenomenal I will say that and some of the parts that it has a lot of the caramel on it it's a bit on the sweet side but overall I am very happy with this and I have very high expectations for apple pies as my lovely grandma's who I just left makes very good ones so highly highly recommend this if any of you guys just want apple picking and you got to find something to do with them I'm giving this a very solid 9 out of 10 hope you guys enjoyed this week's BuzzFeed test if you did leave me a like on it I would really appreciate it I'm going to warn you all now there is a very slim chance but it might be possible that I can't get a video out on one day if it doesn't happen I'm very sorry I just know that I'm trying I'm trying really hard for them not follow me on twitter instagram having awesome weekend and I hope to see
