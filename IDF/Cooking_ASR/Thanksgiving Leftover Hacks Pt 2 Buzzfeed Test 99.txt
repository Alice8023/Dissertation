 What is going on my peeps welcome back to a brand new BuzzFeed test number 99 we are also close to 100. I hope you all are out of happy Thanksgiving I hope you are not sitting there watching this video with a disgusting hangover hitting life right now because some people do that you'd be surprised. But anyway guys welcome back to the channel last year I'm sure a ton of you guys were around when I did the first ever Thanksgiving leftover hacks I did some turkey ramen I did some potato pancakes it was genuinely a really enjoyable and delicious episodes why figured let's go right back to the very same article 19 Thanksgiving leftover ideas and just pick a couple more of these to try out so this year I'm doing the cheesy mashed potato croquettes and the turkey and mushroom quesadillas with beer pickled jalapenos yes I'm going to attempt to try to make those so let's get right into it. Now because I think these will probably take longer to make and I'm more excited to eat them we're going to start out with the croquettes just like last year I happened to be filming this before Thanksgiving so anybody got leftovers yet so I'm going to have to resort to these disgusting instant potatoes I know real chefs everywhere are going to be cursing me left and right but I am not a real chef I am ratchet I just followed the instructions that were all on the box it was pretty simple and easy and I actually threw this into the freezer for a couple hours to hopefully get that leftover dried out mashed potato effect in the meantime I grabbed my block of sharp cheddar cheese and began to chop that up into quarter inch long rectangles that will go on the inside of our croquettes pretty simple stuff so far I also wanted to get my egg and bread crumb mixes all together I just seasoned my panko with some salt and pepper I lightly mixed up my eggs and I think I'm ready to try to start forming these things out of my cabinet I dug my good old friend my waxed paper if any you know what I'm referencing you're the real OG I have not used it since that day but we're using it today I threw down some flour and tried to get some mounds of potato on this and if you thought that instant potatoes in the refrigerator for two hours was not going to work for this you would be right I had the time of my life trying to form these into logs without them sticking to the paper and my hands I definitely used a little bit of extra flour over pretty much everything that these potatoes touched and I was actually able to form them a little bit with the cheese in the middle and what do you know we have another OG friend popping up the preschool plate this is just the most nostalgic episode ever I basically want to throw down my croquettes on this plate and freeze them until they're completely solid before I even bother trying to get them in the egg and breadcrumbs so that's what I ended up doing and it seemed to have worked pretty well they're frozen solid like rocks I double dip them in both the eggs and the breadcrumbs twice and then I dump them down into my 350 degree oil I was beyond relieved when these things weren't sticking to the bottom of the pan or the potato in barstato one of the sides and that's pretty much it I drained them out tried to get some of the excess oil off and I just plated them up with some green onions and I'm very happy with these so let's give them a taste I suck now I'm not going to lie to you the distance from my kitchen to where I'm currently filming is approximately 25 feet in that process of going down the steps I lost one it rolled right off the plate and smashed onto the floor so now we are left with two Nala was very happy about that though am I supposed to eat this with my hand or spoon I see this a little too big I don't even care I just want to eat it that's very good I'm shocked at how thick of a coating the bowler left on the outside you can kind of see it sort of there not really it's not focusing on our camera sucks the cheese has also kind of mended with the potatoes it's kind of a weird consistency but that's a dollar store mashed potatoes for you this is delicious and it would be even better if it was done legitimately with real leftover mashed potatoes I'm going to give this a eight out of ten all right peeps next up we're trying the turkey and mushroom quesadillas with the beer pickled jalapenos and there is a lot of work involved in this simple quesadillas so let's get right into it I started by cutting up my jalapeno peppers I didn't bother even trying to decede these because I figured most of them will come out in the brine so I sliced about five of them up and set them off to the side for one minute now I cut an onion in half I thinly sliced that to try to get some shoestrings as well as a carton of mushrooms of course I watched them off a little bit first and sliced those up evenly as well all is going pretty good so far so we are going to start brining our peppers into a medium sauce pan I added some vinegar and I needed brown albeer for this and the only one I could find in the store happened to be pumpkin flavored which I gladly took I also once again happened to have gotten a six packs oh you guys are going to start thinking I'm alcoholic or something I'm not oh my god in addition to your vinegar and beer I added some honey a little bit of salt and some crushed up garlic cloves and you're going to want to heat this over medium heat for a couple minutes until you start seeing some smoke and everything dissolves you basically want to cook down the alcohol a little bit and let all the flavors after about five minutes I took it off the heat I dumped in all my sliced up peppers I covered it up and let it sit for about 35 minutes and well those are working we're going to get right back over to the vegetables so I grabbed my onions that I cut threw them down along with some butter I still take them for a couple minutes I allowed them to get a little bit translucent I added a little bit more butter because honestly I don't think I added enough but then I just added the mushrooms right on top of that another few minutes later this was looking delicious so I set these aside along with the peppers now there's only one more main ingredient we need for these quesadillas and obviously it's the turkey it's the leftover Thanksgiving hacks and as I mentioned earlier it might be a few days before Thanksgiving so it just so happens my dad is grilling some chicken so I stole a couple of drumsticks I said it last year I will say it again there's barely any difference between chicken and turkey in my book so they should work the same but these things weren't even cooked all the way through so I shredded them up and put them down in the same pan that I had the veggies in now once I had the chicken all the way cooked and I thought that my jalapenos were done pickling we could pretty much assemble this thing in the very same pan I threw down a little bit more butter along with my first tortilla I started with a few tablespoons of some shredded up cheddar cheese that I had leftover my onion and mushroom mixture the jalapenos our leftover turkey and then just some more cheese I am already dreading the moment where I'm gonna have to attempt to flip this monster and about a minute or two later I think that moment has come so I'm gonna use the trusty preschool plate put it right on the quesadilla flip the whole pan over and try to slide it right back on top I'm good man once your cheese is all melted and your quesadilla seems brown you could throw it out of your pan chop it up into some triangles and after I played it a few of the pieces I finished it off with some green onion again I need to try one of these I do have to say I will be very surprised if I end up liking this more than the croquettes I really smell those jalapenos though so I'm a little nervous oh no those those aren't even actually that hot does brining hot peppers take some of the heat out of it I'm sure some of you guys will be able to answer that for me I will say I don't think I drained the peppers well enough because the bottom is a little bit soggy I think there's too much of that brine still on them but this is banging I'm in love with the melted cheddar cheese and onions and mushrooms I highly recommend this one honestly for if you have a ton of turkey leftover I don't think I like it more than the croquettes though so I'll give it a 7.8 out of 10 but I hope you guys enjoyed this week's video if you did leave a big like for me I always appreciate it follow me on twitter on instagram I'm going to be doing the Q&A video on my second
