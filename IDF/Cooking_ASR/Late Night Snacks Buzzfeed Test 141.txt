 Ladies and gentlemen, it is that time of the year. It is officially fall especially where I live in New York The leaves are changing the temperatures dropping everyone's drinking pumpkin spice lattes Where I live in New York it is truly the best time of the year by far It's also the time to whip out all the old Halloween decorations and get to work in the studio a little bit That should be about good But what is going on guys and welcome back to another BuzzFeed test for today All right my Instagram story I give you another four options This was the closest vote that we've had yet but inching out the other three was the late night snacks now There are six recipes shown in this video Unfortunately, we've already done three of them. We've done the potato wedges the salted caramel brownies and the chocolate chip cookies before Not really bad thing because it gets rid of all the sweet stuff Today we're gonna be trying out the pizza chips the deep fried mini calzones and a stuffed rigatoni poppers Some more deep fried stuffed cheese based ingredients for my doctor to scream at me about if you're watching this I apologize, but let's get right into it Now first up today guys we're trying out the pizza chips Which is really just mainly melted mozzarella cheese with some spices in it But for that I grabbed some garlic powder and dried basil some oregano and mozzarella cheese Some pepperoni slices marinara sauce and salt and pepper pretty simple stuff Now I started with this enormous block of mozzarella cheese I got this one because we're pretty much gonna need cheese for every recipe we're doing today I'll probably use this entire thing But once I had a little bit shredded for this recipe I grabbed my pepperoni in the video they use some mini pepperoni pieces I could not find that so today I'm gonna be spending about 40 minutes using my piping tip to cut out some miniature pepperoni circles out of these larger ones This is what my livelihood has turned into But we cannot start to throw these ingredients together So a few cups of the mozzarella cheese some of my basil oregano So my garlic powder the salt and the pepper and I gave that a light toss all together My cheese seems to be much more coated in spices than theirs were but I carried on I found this miniature Cupcake tin you're gonna have to grease this with some cooking spray first and then fill up each little tin about halfway up Just so the cheese can melt down and get pretty thin and crispy and then I just topped all them off with some of my mini pepperoni and this is ready to be popped in the oven 350 degrees and the video says five to eight minutes I took mine out at six minutes and they were nowhere near done. I could barely get them out of the tray So I popped them in for another five or six minutes I wasn't sure if I put too much mozzarella in some of the tins because it just was not melting down and getting crispy I eventually ended up blotting some of the oil and juice off of the top Maybe that was the reason it was not melting down and getting crispy who knows and they are smelling pretty good So I'm gonna set them aside while we work on recipe number two up next today is the one I am by far most excited For the mini pizza calzones. I'm expecting very high things from this recipe I try to get you guys to vote on it before Finally we get to do it, but in order to make them I grabbed some more mozzarella cheese and some pre-made pizza dough Some fresh basil marinara sauce some oil to fry with and salt and pepper Now I'm sure I'm gonna get all of your very pleasant comments about how lazy I am for using a pre-made pizza dough If I wasn't doing three different recipes in this video, I would have made the pizza dough I've made it before relax Once I add the dough down to room temperature I began to chop it up into eight or ten pieces and I let those individual pieces kind of rise on their own While I shredded up some more of my giant block of mozzarella cheese and then just gathered a few basil leaves and chop them lengthwise I don't plan on using a ton of basil any one of these just enough to add some flavor But we can start constructing these things now So one of the time I grabbed my cut up dough balls I tried to roll them out or like poke them out with my hands And then I just loaded it up with some marinara sauce some cheese some of that basil a little bit of salt and pepper And then I tried to pinch and crimp around the edge Hopefully that cheese and marinara sauce will not ooze out into my hot oil and once I had my vegetable oil hot enough One or two at a time I threw them in I tried to get a nice brown color all around the outside A couple of them the sauce did start to come out a little bit But once I saw that I just pulled it out and it seemed to be okay Once again these things are smelling amazing as I cooked them But I'm gonna resist the temptation because we have one more recipe to make The stuffed rigatoni Poppers, which is the most unorthodox out there creative or whatever you want to call it recipe we have today I grabbed some ground beef and some more sauce olive oil and rigatoni noodles Some more vegetable oil fresh garlic onion and cheese you could have guessed by now First and foremost we have to cut up our onion and garlic for those you tallying at home Add it to the list. I still feel bad for giving you guys the idea to literally go for all my videos and count the amount of onions and garlic cloves I've used please don't ever do something like that again But once I had them all chopped up finally I'm gonna get this meat mixture out of the way first I measured out a pound of my ground beef to that I added some salt and some black pepper Equal parts of my parsley and oregano and then my onion and garlic that we just chopped and how can we forget some more of our mozzarella in this This is kind of like a cross between a meatball a meatloaf a hamburger mixture I'm not sure what to call this all I know is there's a lot of onions and cheese in here So it'll be interesting. You're also gonna have to load this into a piping bag I can very confidently say that is the first time I have ever done this with a ground beef mixture and it's a little weird But once I had that loaded up and ready to go I grabbed my box of rigatoni noodles You want to boil these about a few minutes shy of being fully done because you have to deep fry them That'll cook them the rest of the way and as I was Preparing these eventually tossing them in some olive oil so they wouldn't stick together These are not the right size Normal rigatoni noodles that you would use for a ziti or something are like twice the size of these things My box says normal rigatoni, but you could see how small they are So we're gonna have some mini miniature bites. I don't know. It's too late to get a different pasta now Once my noodles were fully cooled down. I began the grueling process of Piping this meat mixture into each one of our hundreds of rigatoni noodles. I was there for a few hours At first it starts very Therapeutically and then you just kind of get in the rhythm and get hypnotized by the process You lose your mind a little bit you start thinking about very existential things What is YouTube? Why are we on here? How do we make a living off of piping ground beef in two past ten? Noodles, but once I used up all of my meat mixture I began the second grueling process Taking each individual one coating them in flour egg and bread crumbs This recipe is pretty much the culmination of every repetitious Overdone thing we've ever done on my channel But it's happening yet again today and it took me a very long time Once I had a bunch loaded up on a plate I gave them a quick freeze for a few hours. I was supposed to do this before I coated them But I forgot don't kill me and finally you can toss these in your hot oil I'm reusing the oil from the last recipe That's why there was some little dark bits in there ahead of time But you want a nice gold brown color on these as well and once I had enough I tried to plate them up in a little pile with a bowl of marinara sauce on the side And after many hours of cooking many dirty dishes and a lot of frying we can try all of this out God we're only a month from the summer and I am so pale already So I'll be honest with you guys. I just think I did this wrong either I put too much cheese in the little tins or Something was wrong with cheese maybe like look how thick that still is They smell good though because they're loaded with spices It It has been a few hours. That's why it's all frosty. I had them in the fridge and I was hoping when they get cold They'll get crispy too. It's just kind of weird. It's just like a little chunk of old Cheese that you would like pull off a pizza or something It's not bad. I like cheese. I don't know that I'd make them again though I'll give them like a six out of ten These are what I'm by far most excited for they smell so good. I love cow's bones I'd rather have a cow's own over a slice of pizza any day and my whole family has been begging to eat these But I have not let them I have to try it on camera first Oh my god Holy cow that is so good. It is the best part of a cow's own Just loaded with melted cheese and sauce Outside is like a fried dough that you'd get from a fair or something It's a bit greasy as you can probably imagine I probably could have blotted the the oil off a little bit better But men are they good oh my lord they have to get a very solid 9.75 out of ten and last but not least the rigatoni bites the Mini version because they're supposed to be twice this size That's probably why it took me so much longer to fill them and then coat them and fry them Supposed to have half the number, but we got through it. They smell good. They look good a little bit of sauce on there They're good the meat mixture comes through more than I thought it would have probably does it how much onion and garlic is in it It's weird though because if you just gave me this and told me it was just like a Grown beef tater ta I wouldn't even know that was pasta in it unless I took it apart and looked the cross section Doesn't look the best make a whole dollop of meat in there Um, but the flavor is there not too bad. I'll give it like a 7.9 out of 10 But I hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did leave a big like as always for the fact that it's October Follow me over on Instagram on Twitter. Don't tweet at me rude things because I'm a be savage back Other than that though, I have an awesome weekend and I'll see you right back here on Sunday for a pumpkin spice episode one You
