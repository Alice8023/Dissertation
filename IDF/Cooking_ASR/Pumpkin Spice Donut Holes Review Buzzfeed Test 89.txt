Yeah, it's for the video. Guys, I'm doing a super legit either I'm getting everything pumpkin spice flavored cereal rice crispy is Oreos is something even orange I'm just making sure everything's right I'm just not sure if this candy corn checks out do you think so do you think it does I like candy corn checks out yes I think the corn checks out I'm just I'm not David Delray I'm sorry well now that that's over what is going on my peeps welcome back to a brand new video now today Friday September 22nd is the first day of fall thank the Lord it's a time for orange flannels apple picking cool weather and sweaters and most importantly over everything else pumpkin spice from this point forward until the end of October every single Friday is our regularly scheduled Buzzfeed tests every single Monday is a pumpkin spice themed DIY or food video we'll see but today it's only fitting to start off with a pumpkin spice Buzzfeed video so we're gonna try out these pumpkin spice donut holes which is what you actually suggested to me in the past and they look fantastic so let's get right into it so to make these bad boys we're gonna grab some flour and sugar some salt and oil to fry in baking powder some pumpkin puree pumpkin spice mix one egg and some butter first off we're gonna sift two full cups of flour add that into our bowl along with three quarters of a cup of sugar two teaspoons of baking powder two teaspoons of the pumpkin pie spice some salt whisk it all together and then set it off to the side now in a whole new bowl we're gonna combine one and one quarter cup of pumpkin puree one egg two tablespoons of melted butter and again mix that together super thoroughly now as much as I love this season and everything about it this canned pumpkin puree kind of always reminded me of baby food a little bit but we will continue throw that pumpkin mix into your flour mix the two together until you get this nice doughy doughnutty consistency not just saw this next step would be a little bit simpler through that batter into the fridge for a little bit in the meantime I threw some oil onto my stove and waited for that to get up to 350 degrees through a little bit of butter onto my hands and began to roll out my doughnut holes that surprisingly these are gonna expand a bunch in the oil when they cook so it'll make them huge but just roll them out all to the same size just about here and now we can begin to cook them up a few at a time I dumped those over into my oil I am using a smaller saucepan today just so I don't use a batana oil with every video I do like this as a result the heat is a little bit tougher to maintain in the oil when you dump stuff into it just keep an eye on your thermometer during this and you'll be just fine and that's the top these guys off I mixed up some sugar and some more of that pumpkin pie spice and gave that a good mix roll all of your still warm doughnuts throughout your sugar my mouth is already drooling during this again I'm very happy to report that these things look pretty similar to bus feeds so let's give them a taste now I have a few here and all of their glory these kind of look like the cinnamon um munchkins for those of you who have dunkin donuts by your house and if they taste like a pumpkin version of those I'll be very happy they're really dense I don't entirely think that I cook them all the way through enough you could see a couple spots there where it's still a little bit doughy and hard frankly honestly I think if I turn the heat up from 325 to like 350 and left them in for about the same time they'd be perfect I think the oil was just too low I think that not only because it wasn't hot enough to cook them um because I left them in for so long without cooking they just absorbed much of that oil it's just my guess I almost just dropped it the flavor is pretty good though um I will admit and obviously when you call anything in sugar and pumpkin pie spice it's gonna taste pretty dang good so I'm gonna give these a six and a half out of 10 it would have been nice to start this month off a little bit better but stick around because y'all don't know what's about to hit you hope you guys enjoyed this week's video if you did leave a like right down there let me know what pumpkin spice stuff you think I should try I'm so pumped for this I've been planning it all year you have no idea but other than that I hope you have an awesome rest of your week and I'll see you right back here on Monday peace you
