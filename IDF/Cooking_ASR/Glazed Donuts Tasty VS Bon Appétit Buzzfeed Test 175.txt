 Just one month ago we saw the clash of two heavyweights Tasty versus Bonaparte in the chocolate chip cookie throwdown Tasty came out swinging they put up a strong fight, but Bonaparte ultimately came out the winner of round one Today right now is round two What's going on guys welcome back to a brand new video as I said This is round two of the tasty versus B.I. series and today it is all about the donuts It's gonna be Tasty's classic glazed donuts going up against Bonaparte more specifically Chris Maracos Greek yogurt donuts They definitely have their differences, but at their core they are similar enough to compare in this regard I think so let's get right into it As with all of these versus episodes Tasty is gonna get their stab first I grabbed some sugar and butter milk and oil some powdered milk flour powdered sugar vanilla extract yeast eggs and water So for anybody who's familiar with donut making you would probably know that there's multiple different types of donuts This one specifically is a more classic yeasted donut It relies on that yeast to eat up that sugar and create all that gas and that airiness Whereas in the second version Chris Maracos he just uses some baking powder and some eggs as his leaveners This one obviously takes a bit more time It's a bit more involved both ingredients wise and time wise It actually gets two different rises with the first one being just an hour And the second one being completely overnight so you're gonna be in this one for the long haul if you want to try it The hope is that at the end of all of this it will well be worth it if it's as good as some of the donuts I've had in the past and as always if you want this specific measurements of all your ingredients Just hop on over to Tasty's video. It's linked down in the description So once all my ingredients were combined to a nice uniform cohesive dough that was springy and bouncy Oiled up a bowl and then gave it its first rise It's only for an hour after which you want to punch it back down Need it for a couple more minutes and then leave it in the fridge overnight now I am aware that the cold temperatures of a fridge Usually do slow down the rise ability of yeasted doughs But this one didn't seem to rise all that much Think it maybe my yeast is a little bit old. Maybe the milk was too hot at the beginning Either way, I am gonna run with this just to see how these come out in the end So once I had that dough a slab rolled out nice and thin I use my three and a half inch ring mold from the McRiddle video to cut out some circles This whole frying procedure may look nice and peaceful and relaxing It was anything other than that. I don't know if I'm cursed or something I broke a glass the fire alarms went off I actually will leave some clips at the very end if you want to see the chaos, but The doughnuts look great. They look like they have a nice uniform golden brown color across the top They only need around 80 or 90 seconds on each side or else you risk over cooking them a little bit So just keep it close eye and the last thing we have to do for these is throw together the glaze Which is just some milk powder powder sugar vanilla extract and water I highly recommend that you throw this through a fine mesh strainer Because even if you don't see clumps of powder sugar They're hiding in there and they will show up on your doughnut at the end Once I believed my doughnut to be cool down enough to where the glaze wouldn't melt right off and drip down the sides I gave all of them a nice thick coating a chopstick works pretty well here Just because anything bigger you'd be scraping off the glaze as you turn them But these look pretty good. So let's give them a try now I said this in a cookie versus as much as I love bon appetit all the sheds there I got to be team tasty, you know, that's what I came up on that's the reason you're all watching me So you know who I'm rooting for I do wish the glaze stayed on there a little bit thicker If I let them cool for a little while longer that probably would have happened Still not too bad though, especially compared to what I think Chris is is gonna turn out to be So the first thing that hits me with this is the glaze whenever I try to make any type of glaze like this with just powder sugar I feel like it's all you taste. It's like very grainy. This is no exception Unfortunately now the inside is like very Bready the crumb looks pretty good nice and even It's got a uncanny resemblance to like Like a hot dog roll This could be one of those foods that I don't eat that often So then when I try to make an episode like this I'm like hypercritical because I never Analyzed a donut before I don't love it. I give it like a 6.2 Up next is the challenger or are they like the champion now and tasties the challenger Either way for Chris Maracos yogurt donuts grab yourself some flour and kosher salt butter and sugar Greek yogurt vanilla extract A's baking powder powder sugar and water now I was very surprised to see that this was a lot easier than Taste these version obviously they're two different donuts So it's hard to compare time wise, but you literally just combine your dry ingredients Your wet ingredients and then slowly add in the dry I believe the key to these is to not over mix them on like the last donuts where you had to need them These ones you don't want to you don't want them to be tough Just mix until you see that last bit of dried flour become incorporated So everything is nice and hydrated This doesn't need to rest at all or go in the fridge even though it may seem very wet at first just liberally add flour as you need it And then you're just gonna roll it out to about a half inch thick as Chris says in the video Don't be afraid of just pouring on the flour to prevent sticking because we're gonna brush it off right at the end Before it goes in the oil. I have to use that same little plastic cap as the last time Because I don't have a circle mold that small, but it worked out fine for taste these and it worked out fine for this too Into my oil all of these went I love the different textures and like craggy bits on the top That's just gonna suck up our glaze that we dipped these in once they cool down and while they were cooling down That's exactly what I constructed and even more simplified version of taste these this was just powdered sugar and water There was nothing else I dipped these as well and it was very thin You could barely even tell that they were glazed But these smell just as good as the last ones, so let's give these a try So these kind of just look like Unglased unfrosted donuts Because that glaze is so darn thin the kind of craggy uneven edges Remind me of those like vanilla donut sticks at Dunkin Donuts that I always got in high school So they taste like that. I'll be happy All right, so these are kind of what I was expecting which Does Dunkin donuts use a sour cream or yogurt donut base? Because from what I remember This is very similar. It's got that nice crunchy outer shell then side is soft Great flavor. I would say the worst part of these is how much oil they sucked up Yeah, if these weren't so oil heavy they'd be like Some of the best donuts I've had Damn it tasty. I feel bad doing it and this might seem like I'm doing it on purpose I'm not there's no reason for me to be biased. These are just better. These are getting like an 8.6 If they weren't so oily they'd go even higher, but I think that's fair I hope you guys enjoyed today's verses round two if you did slap a like on this one Go through both of their channels and find another Potential recipe that would be good for the series.
