 What is going on my peeps my name is David and welcome back to this week's Buzzfeed test Now the rest of you are going to be trying out today is one that I saw on the very first day that I came out over on Tasty's channel And I kind of knew I was going to end up doing it at some point and then I got all your comments your DM So here we are I'm doing it if you have not seen this beauty yet It is called the cheesy rigatoni pie which I'm assuming is going to kind of be like a hybrid between a shepherd's pie and a baked ziti I can't see this thing being bad. So let's get right into it Now thankfully all we're going to need is a few super simple ingredients to make this recipe including a pound of Rigatoni pasta about 28 ounces of crushed tomatoes a few cups of shredded mozzarella cheese a pound of lean ground beef Some Parmesan cheese salt and pepper garlic and olive oil now for step one I wanted to get this rancid garlic out of the way because it is one of my least favorite ingredients to have to prepare Mainly because my hands end up smelling like it for the rest of the day So I quickly got a few cloves Remove the skin off of those and then mince them up really finally and because we already have some pre-sreated mozzarella cheese Because I'm feeling rather lazy today the only other prep work that we have to do is to boil up a huge pot of water With some sea salt and then cook that rigatoni pasta about halfway do not cook this pasta All the way through like tasty suggests because you'll have a heck of a time Trying to stand them all up in that pan later and because they have a lot of time to cook in the oven So don't now after a few minutes of boiling I strain the pasta out set it aside and we can begin to work on the meat sauce So into your pan you want to throw about a tablespoon of your olive oil and then a pound of your lean ground beef Now usually when you make ground beef a lot of that fat renders off and then like pools at the top That's why I said to use lean especially because we're having to add the olive oil and some tomato sauce But once you got all your meat chopped up as finally as you can and then browned all the way through You can then add in your cloves of garlic a teaspoon of salt about a quarter teaspoon of pepper Mix that in and then finally finish it with your can of crushed tomatoes This is a very simple recipe and I'm hoping that you don't have that like Metallic tomato taste that sometimes comes with these cans tomatoes Hopefully after 20 minutes of simmering this any chance of that will be gone now Once that's cooking down a bit We can move back over to our pasta and adding a cup of Parmesan cheese Make sure to toss all of your pasta through that cheese try to separate any noodles that might be sticking together a bit And once you've sifted all of that cheese through your pasta and then the sauce has cooked down for 20 minutes We can finally prepare the entire thing together now What are these things called a spring form pan or a cheesecake pan or something like that? Whatever it is it's what you need and using that pan you want to line the entire bottom with all of your pasta This step is just about as fun as it seems also as I was doing this I came to the realization that I was gonna be cutting it dangerously close with the amount of pasta I had and What you see right now is every single noodle that came in that pound of pasta So don't waste any sorry if this image is bothering any of you out there by the way What is that called the trup- trup- tripofobia or something like that? I think it's the fear of like Holy objects and no not the religious kind only just turned 21 years old but already coming out with the dad jokes Not a good time But anyway top off your pasta with all your meat sauce trying to push them down in the holes of the pasta and Between each noodle this step ended up being a tad more difficult than I thought I don't know if I didn't cut my meat down enough or what but it just was not fitting either way You're gonna want to bake that in a 400 degree oven for 15 minutes Take it out throw about a cup of your shredded mozzarella cheese or however much you need to cover the whole thing And then throw it back in your oven for another 15 minutes at the same temperature afterwards You want to take it out and let it cool up for about 20 minutes and then you could take off the outside of the pan and Okay, I'm not too mad with how this is looking so far my suspicions Originally were right that this sauce barely got down between the pasta, but as long as it tastes good I will have no complaints Now I can't really tell if this looks really good or just really strange I mean I'm mainly Italian so pretty much any dish containing these ingredients is gonna look amazing to me Mmm Okay The sauce surprisingly has a really great flavor for the amount of time that we put it together and sometimes sauces can take hours There's a really intense Parmesan flavor as you might have guessed but my only complaint if you look in The pasta is kind of why is it not focusing? I don't know. It's a tad dried out in the middle I think I might have condensed down the sauce a bit too much either that or you don't need as long the second time When you put it back in the oven. Yeah, in my opinion after the first time it's in the oven Everything's gonna be cooked anyway So when you put the cheese on just like broil it just to melt it down or something because it's a tad dry All the flavors I was hoping for are here though I cannot deny that and for that reason I'm gonna give it a 7.25 out of 10 Hope you guys enjoyed today's recipe if you did a smash a like on this video Now to be honest as time moves on I'm increasingly sweating a little bit because I know my week is gonna be very tight This week and it's the last week of the bet we made of me dyeing my hair For those of you who don't remember I said if I don't post two videos a week for this entire month I will dye my hair some color I've been successful up until this point, but I got one more go. I have to do it I mean it's right there for the taking. I'm sure I'll find a way to do it though other than that I hope you have an awesome rest of your week.
