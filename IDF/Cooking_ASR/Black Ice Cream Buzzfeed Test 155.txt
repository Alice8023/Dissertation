 What's going on my peeps welcome back to a brand new video it feels so nice to just be fully back in the schedule with no tympano on the mind. This is also the first Instagram poll I've done since probably two months ago now and out of the four options I gave you you guys of course chose the black ice cream. Nothing quite like a good old three year old internet trend that is borderline dangerous and not safe for human consumption. Also I'm just so thrilled to be making ice cream this week considering it's been blistering every single day it's about 12 degrees. If my comes out as good as Nicky's did in the tasty video I will be very happy I enjoy a good ice cream cone once in a while so let's get right into it. Now to the surprise of nobody this recipe is difficult and it has a lot of components that could give me some problems. Namely the charcoal and the dry ice. Now the charcoal is not too bad I did plenty of research on it and it seems to be safe if ingested in smaller quantities so I'm not going to be devouring three of these ice cream cones. As for the dry ice not only does it seem like it's borderline impossible to find dry ice somewhere near me but the places that do have it you either need to buy in bulk have some type of pre-existing account with the company to order said dry ice or you know you could buy it online they ship to my state and my area we go to buy it let's read the safety dry ice is harmful if eaten or swallowed never put dry ice into any food drinks or liquids that might be ingested by humans or animals so not only is it unsafe but it just seems like it's going to be a pain to get so I'm going to try a few work around we'll get to that in a second. First thing I did today was gathered up all my ingredients for the ice cream remember we also have to make the sugar cone at the end what you see here is just the stuff for the ice cream. Now I'm going to follow a recipe from a website called chef steps everything on this website is either an ounce or gram so I busted out the old scale and went to town on it this is just a really simple ice cream base that is made up of milk sugar a little bit of heavy cream some milk powder vanilla extract and salts they said you could put this in a blender they said he could put this in a pot on some low heat to make sure everything's dissolved I'm just going to use my whisk attachment to make sure all this is mixed together now also I didn't mention for this first batch I'm not going to include any of my charcoal I just want to see if my idea is going to work with a ice cream recipe that I know works in itself and here's my genius idea you know how back in the day you would put your ice cream base in a bag and then put that bag in a larger bag with some salt and ice well I think it might just work if we combine some kosher salt and ice in these small little bags throw them down in my stand mixer with the dough attachment and give it a very slow churning maybe with this attachment it won't break the bag it'll just kind of push it around also with the stand mixer you should be able to get that churned soft serve effect to what about 30 seconds in I pulled the bag out and it was full of ice cream base meaning there's a hole and we have salty water in our ice cream I quickly whipped up another batch of my ice cream base and this time I'm going to do it old school and work those four arms I put it in a bag and in a larger shopping bag I put a ton of salt and ice I gave it a twist and shook the living heck out of this for a solid 10 minutes you'd be surprised how quickly the ice cream freezes up if you've ever done that old internet ice and salt challenge you might know now right before your mixture becomes completely solid and you get big chunks of solid ice cream I dumped it out into my stand mixer and added about a tablespoon two tablespoons of my charcoal now apparently based on everything I've read this is safe to consume in small amounts people use it to absorb poisons or you know toxins that you weren't supposed to eat so we should be okay if only it had the power to absorb the last two years worth of junk that I've eaten on this channel and although this is looking pretty good I threw it in my freezer to have it set a little bit more while we worked on the cone a while ago if you watched my giant ice cream cone video I made a huge sugar slash waffle cone that I just made on a nonstick skillet so I'm going to use that same recipe for this it's a very odd combination of like egg whites and sugar and vanilla and flour if it works anywhere as well as it did last time I'll be very happy of course we cannot forget our charcoal which I think I might have put a little bit too much but one at a time I spooned about a quarter of a cup of my batter onto my nonstick pen I spread it around a little bit and just like last time these were working pretty darn well the only thing I do warn you guys of if you make this is watch your fingers when you try to flip your little craps because boy are these things hot you also have to form them into cones almost immediately after you take it off the pen I mean the second you take them off the heat they start to crisp up so they can be very hot just be careful but I was able to form a bunch of pretty decent looking cones and once I had about five or six finished I set those to the side and the very last thing I have to do is take my ice cream back out of the freezer and give it a good whip in my stand mixer technically the way we made this it's really not a soft serve ice cream like we were going for but I'm hoping to incorporate some air just to make it really smooth and uniform and it's looking pretty good so let's give one a try here's the big moment the color of the cone looks really good actually the color of the ice cream looks like the gray stuff from beauty in the beast that doesn't look too bad also without dry ice or real ice cream machine that looks pretty close to soft serve the the cone is pretty good I just taste like a normal sugar cone made on a flat top not in a waffle iron ice cream is strange it's got like a weird like grainy milkyness that could have came from the charcoal the milk powder it's definitely not bad but it's not good I'm also pretty certain they're not supposed to eat even half of what I have in my hand without it being borderline unsafe I mean it's fun it's cool it's different worth the time and the six hours I just spent probably not huh looks like I like to tire hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did leave me a big like follow me over on twitter and instagram this video is going up on Thursday because I'm hopefully gonna have another one for you on Sunday and I tried not to put them too close together so look out for that other than I have an awesome end of your week and I will see you right back here next time pace you
