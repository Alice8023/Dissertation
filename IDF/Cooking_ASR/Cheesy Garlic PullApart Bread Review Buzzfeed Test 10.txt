 What's going on everyone? My name's Dave and welcome back to BuzzFeed Test Number. I don't remember what number we're on anymore Now I know this one has been suggested more than once, but I could only find this one So thanks so for suggesting it and everyone else who did I'm sorry I'm Mr. Comment forgive me, but I'm very happy to say that we're getting back to an area that I haven't been at in a little bit We're getting away from the desserts finally. That is this cheesy garlic pull apart bread Now my first touch is that this is gonna be one of those that looks incredible But I don't think it's gonna come out like BuzzFeeds either way. Let's give it a try Firstly and most importantly for this recipe you need a circular loaf of Italian bread Now I went to two or three different stores trying to find this dumb thing until I finally found it in this Italian belly Even though they were freaking massive Some minced or fresh garlic if you get fresh garlic you're just gonna have to mince it yourself Then you'll need your favorite type of cheese. I'm using cheddar and finally some butter Step one let's just get this out of the way grab your cheese block and slice that up into thin slices I ended up cutting up about eight ounces, but you could use a little more or less Then grab this massive loaf of Italian bread and cut that into a great pattern As always it does not have to be perfect, but y'all already know about my OCD Now some to combine both your bread and cheese throw your cheese into each and every cut in your bread Throw that off to the side grab some butter and bang melt that up throw a nice big teaspoon of garlic in there Mix that all together and then you're gonna brush that across the entire top of the bread I realized after I had finished this whole thing It is smart to get it down in the crevices of the bread If you just do it on the top that's really the only spot that's gonna have to flavor now that that is looking pretty good Throw that in your oven on 350 degrees for 20 minutes All right here we go with this strange concoction That's really good tasted exactly how I expected it to and it actually came out a lot better than I thought it would But a couple of things here number one I think it's really good because the bread is really good and really high quality as you saw number two The top portion is really good because it has the butter and the garlic, but it's like a garlic crust like on the bottom It's just warm bread because this stuff kind of didn't get down in the crevices So it's still super good, but if you guys are going to make this try to get the stuff down in the crevices more and Wash the time because it might not need 20 minutes If you like today's BuzzFeed test smash that thumbs up for me as always if you guys have some suggestions leave them down in the comments I am getting a ton of suggestions, which is good But still leave them down there if you have more on my social links are right down in the description if you want to go follow me on those Other than that have an absolutely awesome week. I will probably be back this Sunday not 100% sure either way peace You
