 Does anyone know that feeling where you have a ton of hair on your head and then a lot of it gets cut off? And then it feels like your whole head has been birthed again? Well, that was me yesterday I also liked it so much so that I just had to post yet another corny Instagram selfie for those of you who don't follow me It's David on his course Seamer one. I'm gonna get that promo in somewhere But what's going on guys? My name is David and welcome back to this week's Buzzfeed test before we're getting into this This week's recipe, a couple things. Firstly, for those of you who haven't seen on my second channel a while back I did a Q&A I'll leave the link down in the description if you have not seen that yet But in the future I want to do a Q&A number two So leave your questions for that in the comments of this video The goal is to get that out within the next seven to 10 H days So it all made to any specific deadline because as a lot of you know, I'm not good with those and also on Kind of the opposite side. I'm going away in a couple weeks for quite a bit of time And if I don't have a video out one week or the other don't panic That just means I wasn't able to get one out you got no better than anyone that I try my best to get one out on every single Thursday I have done so for this entire series But that streak might end no promises But anyways, let's get into this week's recipe now last week finally We had a little break from all the desserts and the cakes and the pizza stuff But of course we got to get right back into the sweets this week I'm going to be trying the honeycomb toffee suggested by these people I know the videos kind of old but this looks really good and when it first came out I remember wanting to try it. I just never got around to doing it. So let's see how I do today All right guys, so even though this recipe doesn't have a ton of ingredients I'm still a little scared because some of these recipes are still just as difficult even if they don't have as many Also, excuse the dangerously low candle wicks in the background If anyone wants to donate your candles, I willingly accept them All you're going to need is some white sugar, some corn syrup, some baking soda, some ground Corsese salt, some dark chocolate to melt down and some water Step number one requires you to grab a nice big pot, throw it over medium to high heat And throw in one two cups of your sugar Immediately after that throw in a half cup of your light corn syrup and then a third cup of your water Once you got all your ingredients in the pan, you're going to mix it thoroughly So all the ingredients combined Yes, I'm mixing this with a spatula. This is a ratchet operation And then after that, do not touch it again It's going to boil off for about five to seven minutes until it gets up to 300 degrees on your candy thermometer In the meantime, I'm going to go back over here and grab myself a glass pan with some parchment paper and a little cooking spray Just to make sure you have that prepared So when your candy is done, you can throw it right in. So after the candy was fully cooked or so I thought I took it off of the heat through in a tablespoon of the baking soda and then tried to thoroughly incorporate it into my sugar mixture I was a little scared because the directions say to not whisk this for more than five seconds So I didn't and I would learn later that it was definitely not mixed well But you'll see that when it comes either way through that into my glass pan and it was expanding a little So I was happy about that and then I set that to the side for two full hours a couple hours later I came back to it and it has some weird dark spots going on Along with those little pearls of baking soda as I said earlier So finally I tried to peel this paper off and it came out pretty easy Fliped it over onto my countertop and now you have to take a blunt object I'm going to use this wooden spoon and hit it as hard as you can to crack it up Yeah Yeah, that uh that did not work and not only that now oh Now it's stuck on my countertop Sun of a For those of you keeping tally at home that is now three broken wooden spoons All right people don't know why I'm even bothering Tasting this it kind of looks like the Foming juice that would be at the bottom of like a garbage pale or dumpster or maybe a designer shoe Either way I'm not gonna eat that I'm not exaggerating my jaw was literally glued together Like I couldn't get my mouth open for a second and getting disgusting stuff everywhere Okay, I'm done now I know you all would be very upset with me if I left the video there as big of a fail as this was and as little hope that I'd ever be able to get it right I'm gonna try it again in a couple different ways to hopefully make it a little better So reluctantly I threw together all the necessary ingredients once again into my pan this time I'm gonna cut the cooking time down a couple minutes because I'm thinking maybe I overcooked that sugar I'm also gonna try to switch this up a little bit and throw in a tablespoon of honey to give it some flavor Once I got that to what I thought was the right consistency I took it off of the heat once again throw it into a round pan and then cover that with some crushed up honeycomb cereal I also made up a third batch and threw that into another pan with some popcorn on top I'm hoping that with the sea salt and the popcorn it'll make a nice little salty sweet crunchy mixture So another two hours later I grabbed the honeycomb one and that looks absolutely disgusting Pretty gross. I tasted it anyway and yeah, that was revolting As much as I now did not want to I grabbed the third one with the popcorn and that one tasted even worse So I guess you could call this one a failure I hope you guys enjoyed this extreme failure of a busby test If you still enjoyed it him you with that big thumbs up to make me feel a little better today Listen at least that's the first failure in quite a while so come be some slack all right Thank you guys don't follow me on Instagram or Twitter And you want to leave questions for the Q&A over there Go ahead and follow me the links will be down in the description or of course you can leave them in the comments Underneath this video and I'll try to do as many as I possibly can I hope you guys have an absolutely awesome rest Your week and I'll see you right back here next Thursday Peace
