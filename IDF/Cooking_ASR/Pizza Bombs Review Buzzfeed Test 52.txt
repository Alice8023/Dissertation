 PIZZA DIT Pumpkin, spice, latte, pizza Pizza, mac and cheese, pizza, bread, balls Pizza cones, cheesy eggplant, pizza What is going on my peeps? And welcome back to another BuzzFeed test In other words, the show where we see how many different ways we can repurpose pizza It is no question that the most popular and the most frequent recipes that we have done on this show is definitely pizza-related And here we are again today with yet another Even though this recipe is kind of an old school one, it has been suggested countless times by all of these people And of course it is the pizza bombs I do have to say, compared to a lot of the other pizza-related recipes I've done, it looks fairly easy But I might just have a little trick up my sleeve at the end to spice up this recipe a little bit But without further ado, let's get right into this week's recipe Alright guys, the ingredients you're going to need to get yourself going on this recipe are Some canned biscuit dough, some parmesan cheese, some salt and pepper, some fresh orminsed garlic, marinara sauce, mozzarella cheese, butter and some pepperoni So guys, before we do anything else, we are going to start by preparing some homemade Italian seasoning This is mainly because later in the recipe we're going to need it for our garlic butter And I just never ever have any store-bought Italian seasoning in my house So in a little glass bowl I just threw together some basil and oregano, some rosemary, some cilantro, a little bit of dried thyme, some savory and red pepper flakes And mixed that all together Trust me, this is not only cheaper, but tastes a lot better than the store-bought stuff Now we can throw that off to the side and begin preparing everything else for our recipe I started by grabbing the low moisture mozzarella cheese and cubing that up into about half-inch wide cubes And I cut up between 12 and 15 pieces I threw those all over to the side and we can grab our biscuit dough I timidly popped open the can, took all the dough out of the can, cut them all into halves And then pressed each one of those down into flat circles I know there was some confusion about these, the last time I used them in a video Because a lot of places in the world doesn't have canned dough like this But this is America and we're apparently very lazy, so there's your answer Once each piece of your dough is rolled out to about 6 or 7-inch wide circles I threw them all off to the side and we can finally prepare the garlic butter topping that's going to go on each one of these So in a glass bowl I threw in 3 tablespoons of butter and quickly melted that up in the microwave Add it to close up mince garlic to that, some salt and some pepper to taste And then a tablespoon of our homemade Italian seasoning We have now arrived at the point where we have everything we need to assemble our pizza bombs So first I grabbed a piece of dough, threw down a little spoonful of marinara sauce A piece of pepperoni and then a tube of our mozzarella cheese Carefully folded the edges up around the filling And then tried to crimp up the creases at the top This process was fairly easy for the most part I think it was just really warm in my house at the time And the dough got really flimsy and a couple holes were showing up but it wasn't too bad After I had enough pizza balls rolled up, I grabbed myself a cookie sheet with some cooking spray that I put on it a little bit earlier Lined them all up on that and then gave each one a generous coating of our garlic butter This is not only going to add a ton of flavor to our pizza bombs but it's going to allow the top to get nice and golden brown After I coated each one I also sprinkled some Parmesan cheese over the top of all of them as well And finally threw them into a 375 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes After all that time I popped them out and these look delicious Through them over onto a smaller plate along with some more of our marinara sauce from earlier And the cheese is kind of nowhere to be seen but it looks like it's going to taste good Initially this just kind of looks like your average everyday garlic knots Obviously we all know that is not the case It is not bad but it is not fantastic There are three main ways you can improve this so it would be flirting with about a 10 out of 10 Number one, get rid of that biscuit dough and use real pizza dough I'm assuming they just use biscuit dough because it would just be easier for the average person But trust me it would probably be worth it Number two, use less dough I'd say right now in this one bowl the ratio of dough to filling is like four or five to one And number three going right along with that and these a lot more filling I took about three and a half bites out of that and only one of them had anything in it besides bread Definitely the best part of the whole thing is the flavoring on the top though That is really really good But considering this was a super easy recipe and there is a lot of room for improvement I'm not only going to try to redo it and throw a few extra added ingredients in there But I'm gonna times the size by maybe nine or ten times Unlike the last recipe the main thing I'm gonna be using here is actual real pizza dough So I started by throwing some flour down on a clean surface and rolling out the pizza dough the best I could Through that onto a circular foil tin and pre-cook that in the oven at 350 for just a few minutes In the meantime though I grabbed everything that I was going to be using to stuff this massive pizza bomb I grabbed the rest of our mozzarella cheese and diced that up nice and finally An entire green bell pepper about seven or eight medium sized white mushrooms Half of a white onion and then through that all off to the side along with the marinara sauce And the leftover pepperoni from the smaller pizza bombs After I let the dough pre-cook for just a couple minutes I took it out and we could start assembling this massive thing First one or two cups of marinara sauce went down Then in a absolute ton of mozzarella cheese Follow that up with our sliced up green pepper and onions What looked like a whole pound of mushrooms About 20 slices of pepperoni and this thing is monstrous I quickly rolled out a second bowl of fresh pizza dough through that over the entire top I kind of crimped the edges together like a pie I also cut a little opening in the top so the thing didn't explode while it was in the oven And then coated the entire thing with the rest of that garlic butter mixture I had I feel like this has quickly turned into a tomato recipe Put it through the whole thing into that oven for about a half hour and good Lord, look at this thing This thing is everything I need in life and more This right here ladies and gents is what you would call pizza heaven It also kind of reminds me of one of those birthday cake pizzas I think a thread banger has tried that except this is just two layers of dough Top and bottom if I get a little bit of every ingredient Oh my word I don't really know how to attack this to be honest It's kind of I'm not kidding you this is incredible It's literally just like a fully loaded overstuffed pizza With a garlic knot flavored crust on top And even though my breath is probably gonna be kicking after this This is culinary genius 10 out of 10 Hope you guys enjoyed this week's pizza plus feed test if you did smash your like on this for me I don't think I've asked for a certain amount of likes
