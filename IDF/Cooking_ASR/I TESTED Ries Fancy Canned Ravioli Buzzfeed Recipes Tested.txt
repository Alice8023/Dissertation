 You know, I can get on board with the schedule of one week of torture followed by one week of enjoyment and just rotate those back and forth and as last week was a bit of a holy sh** Mother f***** A struggle to say the least This week we're gonna do something nice and simple and delicious looking Reyes fancy canned ravioli the Buzzfeed goddess rey was given a can of chef boy rd Ravioli is something I am very familiar with and turned it into this intricate delicious looking eggplant and I really want to make it because I don't think there's any risk of like Sirius injury or flammability here with that all being said let's get right into this one If you are Quarantined and you want to make this at home you're gonna need to have on hand some olive oil and kosher salt Some butter and black pepper San marzano tomatoes and panko bread crumbs flour fresh mozzarella cheese some eggplant a can of chef boy rd a shallot and egg Some fresh garlic and some of that nightmare parmesan cheese It's gonna be really funny to see how much over the next year to 18 months I use that cheese If you're curious I chopped it up in about 16 pieces Gave some away and then froze the rest of it So I should have it for quite a while We are gonna start today with our tomato sauce Which is a very simple mixture of our fresh garlic and shallots Some olive oil those tomatoes You have to separate your ravioli from the sauce Which honestly compared to the tomatoes looks like a very strange neon orange color I want to cook this down throughout the entire day So by the end when I'm ready to use it It'll be super condensed and really flavorful Second today I want to start on our eggplant emoji So I sliced that in about half inch wide slices And we're gonna bake this basically just with some olive oil and salt If I was just making this for myself I probably would have peeled it Because when you bake eggplant the skin gets a little bit tough But they don't in the video so I will not either 25 minutes later our eggplant layers were achieved The last made component here is our ravioli Which has to be dredged in flour Eggs and panko bread crumbs And eventually fried for a couple minutes Until they get a nice golden brown I do feel obligated to address that I am not making that Pesto sauce that she garnishes with Simply because one of the main ingredients is pine nuts I cannot have pine nuts so instead of trying to like finesse a new recipe and ruin it I'm just not even gonna bother With our ravioli fried our eggplant baked and our sauce looking nice and thick We can start to throw our layers together Of course with the fresh mozzarella cheese slices too Shout out to my Instagram followers who saw This photo three days ago They always know what video is coming next So if you're curious you can go on over and follow me It's David underscore see more one I am pretty darn happy with how these are looking right now They smell delicious So let's give one a taste I'm not sure if you can tell that in the 30 seconds Between the last clip and right now It kind of got a little bit cockeyed but I'm not mad at this I also feel like this second I try to cut into this thing It's just gonna be absolutely ruined Let's see I mean there's not much you can do it's meant to be eaten anyways But uh yeah kind of just destroyed it I need to bite with everything the sauce The eggplant the ravioli the cheese I think this should do Not that I had any doubts but re-i came through with this one Oh my god This sauce kind of reminds me of Clairs from the hot pockets video It's just so cooked down that it's just so flavorful and delicious And most importantly the ravioli are good I kept their crunch I would never have guessed That this was made with chef boy R.D. The only thing that really sticks out to me is I wish I peeled the eggplant I don't love the texture of the kind of like really hard to chew Purple skin The end result probably wouldn't have looked as pretty But overall it probably would have been better off without it This is gonna go home with a very solid 8.8 out of 10 I hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did leave me a big old like another reminder I have a TikTok now Uh if you're curious it's down in the description as well as my instagram and twitter links Other than that have a fantastic weekend I will see you right back here next week peace And without the agent With the burgers and my money super lazy Trying making me tonight they pain me Trying to supersize my life with my 18 Yeah I was in wavy but we had a vision
