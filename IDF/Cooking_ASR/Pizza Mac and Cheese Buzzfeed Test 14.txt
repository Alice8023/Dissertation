 What's going on everyone welcome back to the BuzzFeed test now it is mid-December and we are in the prime of the holiday season It's time for spending time with family giving and receiving gifts and corny Instagram selfies By the way if you haven't followed me or like that picture is David underscore seamr one Ah, but anyway guys we are back with another awesome recipe this week and being that the pizza dip was not only my favorite video in general But it's my most popular video. I have very high hopes for this recipe and it is the pizza mac and cheese Suggested by this person that person that one and that one pretty much on every single video now this may or may not top the pizza one But either way where best to find out All right guys in order to make this recipe you are going to need butter Pepperoni I have both a full one and pre sliced pre-mixed or fresh cloves of garlic parsley flour milk cheddar cheese some store bought mozzarella cheese to shred some fresh mozzarella cheese to put on top some marinara sauce And some elbow macaroni now guys before we start anything else we have to do some prep work So grab your pepperoni cut about a third of that and then cube that all up. You want about a cup in total of this Next you're gonna take eight ounces of your cheddar cheese and shred that all down be very careful to not slip and almost completely skin your finger Once you got that done move that out of the way grab a preschool plate grab eight ounces of mozzarella cheese and shred that up as well Now once you've got both your cheeses and your pepperoni done We're gonna push that all to the side and grab a pot of water Cook a pound of your elbow macaroni to an al dente because it's gonna finish cooking in the oven Take that out strain it and we're gonna set it aside the last prep work We got to do is slice up your fresh mozzarella. So try to get six or seven slices out of the ball Now we can start assembling the base to this recipe So grab pot grab three tablespoons of butter melt that down then add your pepperoni Let that render off a little bit. I'm already salivating at the smell of this then throw one clove of mince garlic in there and One teaspoon of parsley once that looks okay Then you're gonna throw one two three tablespoons of flour and then one two three cups of milk You're gonna allow that to cook down for a couple minutes then add your cheddar cheese mix that all in then your mozzarella cheese Mix that in as well this whole melted process takes about five to ten minutes Once I got to what I thought was the right consistency I threw in a half pound of the pasta Stir that all together and now we can start assembling this masterpiece The only problem is I do not have cast iron so I grabbed a glass pan First throughout the macaroni then cover that with the layer marinara sauce and your fresh mozzarella Finish that off with a nice even layer of pepperoni and that's gonna go in a 400 degree oven for 25 minutes We're due for a good one guys and this thing is looking like it's gonna be all right guys Here we go after last week's catastrophe this needs to be good Out holy moly that's good stuff this and pizza dip It's right there. I honestly didn't think the combination of a macaroni and cheese and tomato sauce would be good at all But holy god it's good the little crust you have on all the mozzarella cheese around the outside is like On point I have no complaints about this whatsoever Turn out at 10.
