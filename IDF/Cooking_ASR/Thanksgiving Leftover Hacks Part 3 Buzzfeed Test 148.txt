So guys like I said click the link down in the description to go download the stuff for free it helps me out it helps Wondershare out so go show them some love. So guys if you have been around for any amount of time you guys might know that one of my favorite things to do on the channel are the thanksgiving leftover hacks. This is the 30 year in a row we're doing this and the past I've done stuff like mashed potato croquettes like turkey ramen bowls turkey and beer pickled jalapeno nachos some weird but really delicious stuff and hopefully today will be no exception to those rules I'm gonna be making some classic poutine from Tastes is YouTube channel to repurpose our gravy and then a thanksgiving pizza of sorts to reuse some of our turkey and the cranberry sauce. As I'm sure all of you know anything involving pizza is a firm yes from me so let's get right into it. So first up we're trying out Tastes is classic poutine recipe video you can all it cause much hysteria in their comments I took a lot of that into account and it would be really useful to repurpose your day old gravy on the day you're watching this video but unfortunately I'm filming this before thanksgiving so we're gonna have to make our own. First you have to start with your potatoes though I'm really happy to see we're not using any frozen or store bought types of french fries we're making our own with some russet potatoes that I washed a little bit earlier. I tried my best to cut these into even fry shapes but as we all know sometimes my best is still below average I would start doing that more often I know how all of your little brains work and how badly you want to go run down to the comments and hey not me so I'm going to say it first self-deprecation for the win. Anyways once I had my potatoes chopped up and in a bowl along with some olive oil salt and pepper one by one I carefully laid them out on a cookie sheet that I lined with parchment paper make sure it's parchment paper and not tin foil or wax paper so we don't have a repeat of the first ever thanksgiving I had on this channel and after about 30 minutes of baking those they look nice and browned and crispy so we're gonna start with the gravy like I said the whole purpose of this was to repurpose your thanksgiving gravy so it doesn't really matter the ratios or the measurements that I'm using here if you are interested the link to Tasty's video is down in the description for the sake of time on my video I'm just I'm not gonna get into it I will tell you by the end of this it was smelling and tasting really delicious though I was pleasantly surprised and lastly out of the three main ingredients for a classic poutine some people might call this the most important ingredient in the poutine the cheese curds so I went to the store and got some delicious organic cheese listen I went to three different grocery stores within 20 minutes of my house I could not find cheese curds I looked up on the internet the closest thing which is some low moisture mozzarella and when you chop these up don't lie these kind of look like cheese curds and hopefully they'll act the same as well the only real option here was to order some like freeze dried cheese curds on amazon or something which would have taken a number of days to get here and I don't have time for that right now I kept my gravy nice and boiling hot so that when I poured it over my fries and my cheese it would hopefully melt it a little bit it's looking delicious and I want to eat this right now but unfortunately we have to make some pizza first for step number one I got everybody's favorites thing out of the way which is the prep work I chopped up my red onion into some thin strips I chopped up my fresh cilantro which is going to be the garnish after we finished baking this and then we got to the pizza sauce and instead of using a normal tomato sauce we're gonna combine three quarters of a cup of some jelly cranberry sauce with a few tablespoons of barbecue this looks kind of gross I don't think I would ever have thought to combine these ingredients excuse me if I'm wrong but I know some ratio of cranberry and ketchup is a sauce for some meatballs so maybe this is close enough now the last and most important ingredient for this is the leftover turkey that's what you have the most of and unfortunately we don't have anything that we haven't cooked yet last year I got lucky and my dad was grilling chicken for the family that day that did not happen this year so I had to bake some of my own chicken I seasoned it with salt pepper garlic onion some really basic stuff I popped it in the oven for an hour really it should be like three or four hours in order to get this as dry as turkey normally is ew I do not do that um I cooked my chicken normally and it shredded up beautifully and the very last thing I had to do was just shred up some mozzarella cheese and we are ready to throw all of our pizza ingredients together I started by stretching out my pound of pizzo with plenty of flour I let this come to room temperature before I even tried it to work with it you will learn really quickly if you try to use cold pizzo it's not your friend it doesn't want to work with you but this one's looking pretty good so I slathered on my cranberry pizza mix this looks even grosser when you spread it out because you could see all the chunks of the jelly cranberry that I didn't mix I give it a healthy portion of my mozzarella cheese to cover up what may or may not be gross we will find out and then I just finished it off with a bunch of my shredded up turkey chicken and some of my red onion now that I think about it this is really close to any barbecue pizza you buy minus the turkey and the cranberry but it still should be good and ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it has been years but yeah boy got a pizza stone I left that in my 450 degree oven for a half hour I get nice and hot to have some bottom heat so my crust hopefully gets nice and brown and crunchy at the bottom and after about 15 minutes in the oven the top was at least looking pretty good so I took the whole stone out I chopped it up right on there and with the slice I'm going to try I garnished it with a little bit of cilantro finally we can try out our two dishes now I'm a new pair I have never had poutine I've never had a combination like this so all my Canadians out there let me know if this looks even a little bit close to what you eat I'll tell you that I love fried cheese curds from Buffalo Wild Wings A&W that stuff's delicious so I'm sure this can be bad I've never even french fries with a fork before I was so good I wonder who the first person to think of this combination was like let's put some chunks of cheese with some gravy and french fries that'll be delicious and he was right I'm sure also that a proper gravy with some drippings from the turkey in it would be even better than this but this alone is still really good so I'll give it like a eight and a half out of ten and now for this thing which I'm a little more nervous about um cranberry which is really sweet on pizza I don't know this is delicious what in the world this is so good the sweetness from the cranberry work so well with the barbecue sauce and the onion and the chicken this is oh my god this is why I look forward to doing these videos every year people and this might just be the best recipe we've done out of any of the years this is so good if you have some pizza dough in your fridge or you want to whip some up really quick and you have mozzarella cheese I highly recommend you try this this gets a ten wow I hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did leave me a big like follow
