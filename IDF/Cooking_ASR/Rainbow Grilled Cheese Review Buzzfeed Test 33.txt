 What's going on my pips my name is David and welcome back to Buzzfeed test number 30 something and something We are really starting to get up there in the amount of episodes that we've done of these anyway As all of you know this past weekend was playlist live down in Orlando I had time of my life I met a ton of you guys. I got a ton of pictures if any of you guys were there and took a picture with me Please send it to me on either Twitter Instagram Email it to me because I want to make a big collection of them and if you weren't there You better get to VidCon or playlist DC in September because I'm gonna be at both of those as well But let's get into this week's recipe a ton of you have already suggested one that's getting super popular on Facebook and YouTube recently rainbow grilled cheeses just try to ignore that incredibly demonic looking woman Now I know you're all thinking that this one is gonna be super simple and it's gonna be nice easy recipe But let me assure you that there are quite a few steps to this one. So let's see how we do All right guys for this Alex Ridingen grill cheese You're gonna need your favorite types of bread. I'm using some we and some Italian in the video They use three different types of cheese So I'm gonna use a block of Swiss some mozzarella and some shredded Colby Jack and then of course some different food Colourings so your first step is to shred up the cheese if it isn't already So I first started with the mozzarella and then bam switch over to the Swiss through some of my Colby Jack down next to those And then combined all of that into a big bowl I also didn't use as much Colby Jack as I did the other ones just because there's some yellow cheese in that and I don't want it to mess up the colors But once it was all mixed up I divided it into four different piles and then one by one Spread some food coloring on each pile I also highly recommend either throwing out a glove or mixing this with a spoon or something because your fingers will be Die if you do not so one by one I mixed the color into the cheese I threw a couple more drops of food coloring and if I needed to and those came out looking pretty good So now we can pretty much start assembling these I took my Italian bread and got some nice big slices out of that then spread some butter on my wheat bread The Italian bread and then threw those both down on a skillet and then one by one I carefully threw down stripes of each color of cheese tried to keep them separate Buttered another piece of each type of bread and then through that right on top after a few minutes of cooking on the first side I carefully flipped each one and I think they're pretty much done So I grabbed them off the skillet and here is the big moment I Nice not bad at all if I do say so myself it actually even looks better when I pulled bread apart this way You can see that the different colors pretty much stayed separate for the most part. Let's give these a taste Okay, so obviously food coloring doesn't really change the taste of things So I'm more tasting for how the blend of the three cheeses tastes. This looks interesting now That's good stuff the sharpness of that Swiss that I shredded up goes really really good with like the creaminess of the mozzarella and I was scared but that Colby Jack cheese with the with the yellow pieces in it. It didn't really bother the color at all Not the best grilled cheese I've ever eaten, but There's definitely up there. I wonder if it died my teeth green at all. I don't think so It's a good grilled cheese though Now since I feel like this recipe was so straightforward and quick and easy to do and I have a ton of rainbow dyed cheese left over You already know what's about to happen How about some rainbow nachos I threw a couple chips down each one of the colors microwave those and bang not too bad either How about some rainbow cheese French onion soup throw some broth with some onions then your bread topped that off with your rainbow cheese Cook that down and bang that's looking pretty dang good too. I give that one a taste and I'm kind of impressing myself today Hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did smash a like on this for me Can we try to hit 7000 in a week? I believe in you.
