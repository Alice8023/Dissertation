 On this perfect day Nothing standing in my way On this perfect day When nothing can go wrong It's the perfect day I'm doing a Buzzfeed Tested video So all those recipes that you see on Facebook that pop up And this is also a collab with my friend Courtney Lungquist And I'm pretty sure she's the first one to start this solo Like Buzzfeed Tested video idea And I'm pretty sure she's the first one to start this First one to start this First one to start this Brrrr What's going on my pips? My name is David and welcome back to Buzzfeed Tested number 26 Meaning we've been doing this for 26 weeks Meaning we've been doing this for almost 7 months And what is going on with YouTube these days When I first got this idea I specifically searched to make sure No one else was doing this and I'm pretty sure no one else was Fast forward 7 months and Buzzfeed related videos are all over the damn place Buzzfeed recipe tested Buzzfeed DIY tested Buzzfeed recipe review I guess this idea is turning into the YouTuber whispers of 2016 If any of you guys are Factor Joe fans you will get that reference And then we guys let's forget about it, I'll get over it eventually This week we're going to be trying the 3 ingredient cookie truffle Suggested by this person and they look pretty nice simple So let's get right into it Alright guys super simple recipe for us to try this week All we're going to first need are some cookies I'm using Oreos, chips of hoi and Milano's Some different types of chocolates It's funny how often chocolate is starting to show up in these recipes It's almost becoming the new cream Chee Damn it Alright to begin I'm going to throw an entire package of Oreos in my blender Once again they don't tell you how much to put so I'm going to assume that it's an entire package Blend that up to a nice powder Then throw that into a bowl with an entire block of cream cheese Ew By the way to anyone who's wondering I don't hate cream cheese and I never have It's just that so many recipes use so much of it I've got entire of it Anyways once you got that mixed up into what looks like a motor oil cookie dough You're going to grab yourself a cookie tray from wax paper And start rolling up little balls of the dough I got about 20 to 22 balls out of this so just keep that in mind if you want to make more or less Once those were all formed I took the tray and threw it in the freezer for about 15 minutes While that was in the freezer I grabbed some milk chocolate and melted that down in the microwave I've had countless nightmares about melting chocolate for the past two weeks in my life Either way I got a pull through doing this for you guys After the 15 minutes I took the balls out of the freezer and coated them in the chocolate At first it was kind of difficult because the balls were picking up a ton of chocolate But eventually you get the hang of it And those are all looking pretty good I threw them back in the fridge for a couple minutes just to speed up the setting process And melted down some white chocolate in the meantime And eventually gave those a nice little drizzle of the white chocolate These are looking actually the same as bus feeds And once again I threw them in the fridge Now I'm going to quickly do the other two cookies that I have So first I grabbed the chips of hoi, blended them up, mixed up with some cream cheese, rolled those into balls, froze them you guys know the drill I actually coated these ones in the white chocolate And then threw a couple of chocolate chips on the top of those Once again these are looking really good And finally I'm going to do the exact same process for a third time with the Milano cookies I'm also going to use the least amount of cream cheese in this one just to see which one is going to turn out better It was just as easy to mix and combine and I ended up getting the same consistency So let's hope that this one isn't as cream cheesy as I think the other ones are going to bake Then decide to sprinkle some Easter colors on top of them Kind of looked like a unicorn threw up on them but we'll just go with it And once I had all three batches done I made up a nice little platter and there you go This is actually looking pretty professional if you ask me I have a hunch that this is going to be a classic don't judge a book why it's cover Even though this might be the opposite of the point that that tries to make Anyway, let's begin with the Oreo Truffle I don't want it Oh, that is so like sickly This one had by far the most cream cheese in it It's almost like it separates in your mouth the chocolate goes on one side and then you just got to bowl the chocolatey cream I'm not a fan two out of ten on that one next up the chips of hoi with a white chocolate coating Please be better Okay, as you saw I put much less cream cheese in this one and that was a good choice I'm really really trying to taste it because I know what's in it And even I just get like barely little hint of it like the back of my tongue Seven out of ten we are getting better last but not least the Milano cookies You want me? Again much better I feel like I got to keep checking myself to make sure I don't have chocolate on my face So this one is better but I still like the middle one more This one gets a five out of ten the Milano's are kind of like Matsugi If any of you eat like Matsu still not bad though So what have we learned don't use Oreos use much less cream cheese than they do in the video But overall a shocking success if you guys like today's Buzzfeed test When you slap a like on this video for me let's shoot for 4,000 again this week If there's recipes that you've seen that you want me to try Leave them right down in the comments or just tweet them at me that's a lot easier And we kind of have a very special edition of a Buzzfeed test coming up next week So if any of you guys can guess what it's gonna be leave it down in the comments And if I see you get it right I will let you know Anyways have an absolutely awesome rest of your week guys I'll see you right back here next Thursday Peace
