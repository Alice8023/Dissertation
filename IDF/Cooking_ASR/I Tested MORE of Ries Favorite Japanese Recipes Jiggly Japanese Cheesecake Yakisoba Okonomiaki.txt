 What's going on my peeps welcome back to the channel I am super excited to jump into this one because as I mentioned last week We're gonna be picking up right where we left off and doing part two of Rie's favorite Japanese recipes On the money today for our main course is going to be a yaki soba savory pancake Okonomiyaki and then unfortunately for dessert another iteration of the jiggly Japanese cheesecake if you missed last week's video Where I did all those other amazing Japanese recipes. I'll leave the link to that one down in the description so you can go watch it after But let's get right into this one If you'd like to make this at home along with me grab yourself some all-purpose flour and bean sprouts Some bonito flakes and bonito powder Tempura bits and cuppy mayonnaise Mirin and Okonomiy sauce fin sliced bacon some water some scallions In egg yaki soba noodles and green cabbage one of my favorite things that's come of me doing all these Videos over the years is how many new recipes I've been able to learn and experiment with and taste that Normally I wouldn't be able to and this one is no exception It's got a really nice mix of familiar and unfamiliar ingredients For example, I've never cooked with Okonomiy sauce or these bonito flakes Which if you didn't know is just razor thinly sliced Fermented and dried fish normally some kind of tuna if I'd found these bonito flakes a week earlier I could have used them for that dashi broth that we turned into miso soup But I'm sure there will be a next time so I got all that prepped up I whipped together my savory pancake mix Which was just flour water and mirin and with that we can move on over to the flat top where everything else is gonna come together There's a lot of steps here There's a lot of like going back and forth and trying to time things out based on how long it needs to cook So bear with me with the camera and stuff you start by layering up your first viewing ingredients on that pancake base Before topping it with bacon and some more mix flipping it over and then heating up your noodles Shout out to my friend Chris by the way for allowing me to use this flat top because I'm sure you could try to do this in a couple different Non-stick pans, but this I imagine is a heck of a lot easier Although I don't know how much of a difference it would have made on this first attempt either way Because this was a bit of a mess Re-e makes this look so damn easy in that video flipping it over flipping it back and forth without all your stuff flying out the sides It is not trust me when I tell you just like with the tamagoyaki egg last week I figured I'd finish this first attempt and and get a full round of practicing through But with the second one I was gonna try to really nail it down and by the way Before I forget before you all go we're running down to the comments about me using this metal spatula I'm barely touching the surface of this and it's one of the only spatula's I have that's big enough to Flip this entire thing so relax yourselves plus like I said it's not even mine. It's my friend Chris's so Whatever I would say the second attempt was like Moderately better. I kept trying to push it back together after each flip, but it's really hard This thing gets topped off with a fried egg and some more of our Okonomisau spread out nice and evenly across the top Some cuppy mayonnaise and if you look really closely Weirdly moving bonito flakes. I saw this in the video and and brushed it off But seeing it in person is slightly unsettling, but let's give it a try anyway By the way, I saw some of your comments last week. No, I do not have some type of nail disease And this is not nail polish. I smashed that mini garage door a few months ago when I was very Tired I don't really know what to make of this one though if you just put this in front of my face with my eyes closed I I could not tell you what this was based on the smell the bonito flakes are the strongest odor coming off It's they're very fishy But I also get a real like barbecued smell from that Okonomisau so we'll see I That was just the biggest mindscrumble of flavors and textures. I've never experienced before. I don't think so hold on So the sauce is closest to a barbecue sauce as I mentioned It's got that same sweetness of almost like a brown sugary molasses type deal But you could tell there's something else going on something earthy That's probably from the vegetables or something else they put in there If you've been around the channel for a while You know that one of my biggest issues with some foods is when bacon isn't cooked very well And it's just like super gelatinous and raw feeling still and that's the case with this to be expected Because there's only so much cooking you can get done on that one side other than that though I'm enjoying everything here the crunchy tempura bits the cabbage It's a savory pancake with egg and like sauces mayo barbecued. It's it's pretty good I think it just took me a minute to process everything I was eating But overall give it like a 7.4 out of 10 Next up we've got Rye's super simple looking jiggly Japanese cheesecake made in a rice cooker And for that I grabbed some pancake mix and heavy cream granulated sugar and powdered sugar a stick of butter a block of cream cheese and two eggs I started by separating two of my eggs We're going to use both of the egg whites and the egg yolks for this and because it's me You're dealing with of course I have to break and obligatory egg yolk and waste a third egg and then to the egg yolks We're going to add our cream cheese. I know it's some you might be thinking Why is he just talking about and then using cream cheese like nothing like nothing's ever happened guys I think we're getting older. It's time to move on it's time to progress and grow Where's case scenario? I am the editor of these videos So if any block of cream cheese decides to mouth off in the future All I'd have to do is this and then that Anyways, let's finish getting together our egg yolks vomit cream and pancake mix preferably without this happening Okay My kitchen supplies have been dropping like flies recently one after the other and I'm now also in the market for a new sifter as well So my main problem with jiggly Japanese cheesecakes in the past was that they're very egg forward If I remember correctly, I don't think I loved any of the iterations that I've ever made It kind of just tastes like lightly sweetened cooked fluffy eggs I certainly would rather have something taste like eggs than any American cheesecake where they just dump blocks of cream cheese And a little sugar and vanilla and egg in a pan and cook it I've said it a thousand times and I will say a thousand more. I don't know who invented it I don't know why everyone pretends like it's this delicious creation American cheesecake is vile end of discussion For this version We're going to be whipping up the egg whites separately and then carefully folding them into our flour and egg yolk mixture Before buttering up the pan of our rice cooker and then loading it in to let it cook for about 70 minutes I realized that every rice cooker is different and depending on which settings that you choose It can mess things up even more But after 70 minutes this was still raw after about 80 minutes It was also not very cooked looking I honestly ended up losing count But it was well over an hour and a half until this thing looked set enough to be able to flip out onto a plate I let it cool before sprinkling on some powdered sugar and it looks Okay, I wish I can procrastinate for even longer But I guess it's time to give it a try In my head there was no way that this wasn't cooked all the way because of how much time it's been in that rice cooker But when I was cutting it it was pretty wet And it doesn't really jiggle a whole lot either. Let's see the moment of truth So right off the bat I like how it doesn't just hit you straight in the face with eggs Like some of the other jiggly cheesecakes have done I don't love the texture It's very reminiscent of a trace-laced cheesecake But even more like wet and soggy if that's possible That could be because it's still undercooked And I just don't know my rice cooker that it's possible I'm sure this is just me and my high-per-sensitivity to cream cheese But you can just barely get the like tangy In my case off-putting aftertaste right at the very end It's not terrible And I did eat more than I thought I would I'll give it that It was super simple and easy to do but it might have to be just another chapter in the cream cheese diaries I hope you guys know of today's video If you did leave me a big old like I'm gonna do something that I've done in the past And I'm gonna let you guys comment on this video Whatever you want me to do next week And literally whichever comment has the most likes Is the one I will do regardless of ingredients or price Within reason So like each other's comments to which recipes you want to see Follow me over on Twitter and Instagram if you do not already and other than that Have a fantastic weekend and I'll see you right back here next time Peace I wasn't way before we had a vision
