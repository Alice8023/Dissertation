 So on this week's YouTube poll I give you guys some crazy and delicious looking options I give you the flaming hot chino burrito the chili cheese burger cups some Canadian Poutine I even gave you a cookies and cream icebox cake which would have taken me a week and you guys picked the pancakes Honestly I expected this to come in last I was shocked by this if this is your way of giving me a little bit of a break because you know what's coming up in October and how many videos I have to post Thank you. That was very sweet of you guys either way yes we are making the best fluffiest pancakes you will ever eat and I know the title only says fluffiest but in the video she very clearly says and we found what it actually takes to make the best fluffiest buttermilk pancakes ever Which really is just a better title on my end Now these do seem very simple and in a large part they are but there is some room for error and I have a lot to stand up to considering how good some diner pancakes are so let's get right into it So guys in order to make these supposed fluffiest best pancake to ever eat I grabbed myself some buttermilk from the store a few eggs some baking soda and kosher salt A stick of butter some white flour and sugar and then just some baking powder And we're gonna start with our dry ingredients for this one we have five of them They're gonna be our flour baking powder baking soda salt and sugar As always if you want the exact measurements hop on over to taste these video it is linked down in the description I give that a like mix with my whisk and then set it aside while I mix together my Wet ingredients I'll be honest here buttermilk always kind of like skewed me out a little bit It kind of smells like sour cream or like very off milk it's very thick I know that's pretty much what it is just like an acid mixed with milk to curdle it a little bit But it just sounds gross if you ask me Also, I'm not sure if you could really tell but the cold buttermilk kind of made my melted butter Almost solidify and a little chunks so not only was this a little bit nasty from the buttermilk But then it's chunky from the now cooled down butter This should be interesting I dumped that mix into my dry ingredients and then very carefully folded them together Just until they were equally mixed if you see little pockets or little spots of the dry ingredients And to finish our butter off we need to add in two egg whites We added in the egg yolks earlier into the wet ingredients I don't know the exact reason for splitting them up like this but We did so again I just mixed until the egg was just barely incorporated And then I covered that with a dish towel and let that sit for 30 minutes And now for the most controversial part of this video most likely They recommend using a cast iron skillet I have one but mine is grossly like rusted and needs to be re-seasoned It would take me hours I don't really feel like doing that right now so I'm gonna use a normal non-stick pen Plus in most diners and restaurants they would use a flat top anyway And that's closer to a non-stick skillet I'd think And with that cue all of the pen and skillet experts that are commenting right now tell me how wrong I am And then I should quit YouTube and delete my channel Anyway is one at a time I spooned on a half cup of my batter This was very thick so I tried to make it a even circle You want this over medium heat so it's gonna take a few minutes on each side to get that nice golden color A few of them I let go a little bit longer than I would have liked but Eventually I got a couple that looked pretty darn good So I stacked them up on my plate and now it is time to give these a try So as far as the fluff factor goes here I'm very impressed These are some of the thickest pancakes I've seen in my life This is not sponsored in any way super form I just like this herb Don't tell me it's straight corn syrup and fakeness I know already Now I know what a lot of you are thinking Anything with that much butter in it is gonna taste good. I'm thinking the same thing. Yeah, these are good I can see these being super filling. I would not be able to finish all four of these. There's no way Um, but they're they're tasty like they're probably better than most dine or pancakes Once again, if this was your way of give me a little break I do appreciate it. This was a very easy simple and good tasting recipe I'll give it a 8.3 out of 10 But I hope you guys enjoyed today's Buzzfeed test if you did leave me a big like Get ready for some big changes especially behind me around here next month We're gonna get a little crazy. You'll see what you're in for but follow me over on instagram and twitter if you don't already And until next time have an awesome what day's it have an awesome weekend You
