 What is going on guys welcome back to this week's BuzzFeed Test now a ton of you guys have been suggesting that I do the eight game day appetizers for like months ever since this video has come out But there's been a couple problems number one. I've done the pigs in a pretzel blanket. I've done the pizza bombs I've done like I think four out of the eight honestly And number two, it's never really been game day for me until now See down there those are the Yankees And they just did something. I don't know what happened. Everyone just got loud This is drunk Ryan. This is drunk Lindsay say hello So today I am trying out three of the four recipes that I have not tried yet But I'm hoping this is gonna be a good episode for you guys. I got a game to watch in the meantime But I hope you guys enjoy so let's get right into it So for the first course today we're gonna be making these pull apart garlic rolls These seem super quick simple easy what you're gonna need is some refrigerated biscuit dough a stick of butter some garlic powder Parsley and shredded mozzarella now in some past videos some of you guys give me a hard time about buying Pre-shredded cheese because they loaded up with these chemicals So the cheese doesn't stick together I guess So I'm not gonna be lazy today. I shredded about half of that original block because all you need is about one cup of this I put that all off to the side for now though and then just popped open my can of biscuits and cut them into thirds Because I think my biscuits are a little bit smaller than the ones that Buzzfeed used now You just have to pop all those biscuits into a bowl along with three tablespoons of melted butter I have teaspoon of your garlic powder two tablespoons of parsley and one cup of that shredded mozzarella Like I said before this is a super simple recipe to do that would be a perfect first course if it ends up coming out good So once that's all mixed up all you have to do now is fill your little muffin tray with your pieces of dough The only problem was it was really hot in my house and the dough kind of like stuck together But they're looking good so I popped it into a 375 degree oven for about 15 minutes and although it didn't rise as much as I was hoping they actually don't look half bad They also came out of the pan nice and easy so let's give them a try I do like the overall look of them. I have to say they're like nice and browned around the bottom They're kind of small though. I'm sure you can make a bigger version of these in like a cupcake tray if you wanted to Now when you load something with butter garlic and cheese obviously it's not gonna taste bad But they're kind of on the dense side which is why I was hoping that they would puff up a little bit more And become a little bit um lighter But they're not bad overall so I'll give them a 5.6 out of 10 For course number two we're gonna be making some deep fried deviled eggs Which I did think were a little strange looking when I first saw them a few months ago But we're trying them out grab yourself some hot sauce mayonnaise and yellow mustard relish panko bread crumbs six hard boiled eggs some paprika and some salt and pepper And oh yeah, these are fried so um Do I have to even mention what else we need first begin by taking all the shells off of your hard boiled eggs now The easiest method for me was always to crack the bottom or top where that little air bubble was And then just pull the shell down the sides and I did have some trouble with one of them But they came off pretty easy next up You just want to carefully chop each one of those in half Put the whites off to the side and then carefully remove all of the yolks out of the middle I always thought there was a strange Green tinge around the outside of the yolk when you boil eggs like this But I just hope that's normal just add to your yolks a few tablespoons of mayonnaise a tablespoon of relish One tablespoon of mustard and then a half teaspoon of hot sauce If you haven't already guessed I'm doing half of what tasty did in their video They did a dozen eggs and I'm doing six and I actually let that set in the fridge a little bit while I worked on my egg whites My favorite part of any video that requires it We are going to dip these eggs into some flour Some more eggs and then some panko bread crumbs I'm sure you guys aren't tired of watching me do this. Oh no Just when you thought we've egg and breaded everything possible We're egging and breading actual eggs. So exception for you Lastly, you have to drop those into some hot vegetable or canola oil and let them cook down for a few minutes flipping them throughout Yada yada yada. I don't know how many times. I've explained this process And after you've removed them and let that oil strain off all you have to do now is pipe each one of those eggs with your yolk mixture And these actually turned out looking pretty good surprisingly. So let's try I will admit that I'm rather proud of this plating even though my whole house smells like eggs right now, but you know My brain is confused the filling is great. That's the best part in my opinion I don't know how I feel about warm eggs With the cold filling on top usually devil eggs are always served cold Which is why this is probably so weird to me But overall it's not bad again. There's a good crunch on the egg. Maybe I'm just not used to it So I'll give them a seven out of ten And last but not least today we have these garlic parmesan potato wedges Another nice and simple recipe to round out this video I just gave the potatoes a quick rinse in the sink and chop them into wedges A couple of these were a little bit oddly shaped, but I did the best I could when cutting them But once I got the wedges all cut up I just threw them into a bowl along with a few tablespoons of olive oil And then a half cup of parmesan cheese, which if this seems like a lot it is I don't think it needs that much ill Either way, I gave those a quick toss and then you have to work on the dry rub in a separate bowl I added some salt some Italian seasoning garlic powder Paprika mixed those four ingredients together and then topped that over my potatoes All you have to do now is line your wedges on a cookie tray Along with some aluminum foil and then in a 400 degree oven for 40 minutes Just bake those off until they become nice and brown I just now noticed that my camera was all messed up during the last taste test my apologies It's based now, but here are our garlic parmesan wedges They kind of remind me of those potatoes that you can get from KFC Hopefully they'll taste a little bit better though I kind of wish I saved half of these to fry in the oil I used for the last recipe Because they're a little bit dried out not gonna lie That's always my fear whenever I'm baking something like this in such a hot oven The flavor is not bad though. I'll give it that I think with some ketchup or ranch dressing or something These would get a considerable upgrade, but as they are I got to give them like a four at a 10 Hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did smash a thumbs up on this how many should should we try to get two 200,000 yeah, that's more views than I even get ever Okay, that's 20,000 Okay, let's be realistic.
